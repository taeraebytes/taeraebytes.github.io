 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>
