      <p>his vocal ceiling is pretty high and i dont think he even reached half of it yet plus he has a pretty tone so he just needs to keep improving and get a vocal coach that understands his vocal strengths cuz i wanna hear more of his full voice its so deep and sexy

might get dragged but hao and taerae are prob 80 percent of their vocal ceilings, but with ricky and gunwook like u can tell they still have so much more to grow like they barely at 50 percent</p>

      <p>Hao needs to explore more of his lower register. Like I literally think that he is that as well for his higher notes. 

But anyway, kpop as a whole has a thing with not exploring their low tones ðŸ˜…

Is it bad that I think Hao sounds more attractive singing with his lower register??

Taerae frankly I think already hit his ceiling so he should also explode his lower register like Hao.

I can't speak for Ricky since I don't like his vocal tone but gunwook is someone that is really main vocal material. It's hard though since if he's gonna be debuting in a group, he'll sacrifice either his vocals or rapping for the group unless he goes solo</p>

      <p>i loveeeee a good lower register so i get u but yea thats the thing gunwooks not going solo and hes most likely sacrificing rap even if he was in a group that tailored for it more its just never gonna give so long as hes in a kpop group
