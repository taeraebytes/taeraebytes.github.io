      <p>Pt. 2:

Lastly I want to point out the part where he thanks fans for "being with me during what might be the most brilliant time of my life". All the members allude to the group's iminent disbandment, but he likes to go further and refers to his time with Zb1 as his brightest era. This is not him being negative about the future or himself, but rather pragmatic in his outlook and grateful for what he has now and lucid about the roles luck and fate have played in his success so far. Once he figures out how to safeguard himself he'll seriously do well, whatever that means to him. And I'd say at the end of the day that's all you can really ask for as a fan.</p>
