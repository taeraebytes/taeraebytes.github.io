      <p>his vocal ceiling is pretty high and i dont think he even reached half of it yet plus he has a pretty tone so he just needs to keep improving and get a vocal coach that understands his vocal strengths cuz i wanna hear more of his full voice its so deep and sexy

might get dragged but hao and taerae are prob 80 percent of their vocal ceilings, but with ricky and gunwook like u can tell they still have so much more to grow like they barely at 50 percent</p>

Hao and Taerae are really close to finishing their 3 story, 2 car garage suburban american dream home with green checkered patterned lawns but can still get a bit better with stability by getting nice comfy furniture, planting flowers in their garden so its not just green.
Matthew needs to demolish and reconstruct his house ðŸ˜­ I'm sorry I really do not like his nasal singing technique but maybe it's just a me thing, I feel like he wants to build his house like Hao and Taerae but doesn't know how so he's following diy guides on youtube but he already built the skeleton of the house so he has to deconstruct and hire professional builders to fix his issues.
Ricky and Gunwook agree they need to keep building their house but they give me more of a luxury condo in downtown than a house because I do see really high potential to shine.
Yujin needs to commit and I mean in the sense that the plans are drawn, materials ordered, down payment paid and construction started but the builders are lazy, slacking off dragging out the construction time to get more pay. He needs to go there and scold them to get serious but by looking at the plan his house has good potential.
Gyuvin is just a mobile home, I don't see him ever saving up to build a house but maybe some small upgrade in his mobile home, maybe get a mini fridge, maybe get solar panels so he can buy an electric heater so he doesn't freeze at night.
Jiwoong is just a squatter.</p>
