To paraphrase a tweet i saw recently, personal growth comes not from the mere acquirement of knowledge and skills but from long, arduous periods of humility where your ego relents, you accept and reflect upon your responsibilities, blindspots, and shortcomings, and you figure out which of the outcomes you're unhappy with were on you and which were out of your hands.

Based off his words over the last year about self-improvement and especially about wanting to be an idol the fans, doubling as proxy for himself, "won't be ashamed of", I think this is something gw innately understands and regularly cycles through, though maybe not always as productively as he'd personally like ("the reality is different from my ideals"). I do think his bold show of confidence that propelled him to his current heights now puts an additional mental burden on him to 'live up' to, what with the constraints of Zb1's contract becoming more untenable and his goals and standards for himself becoming more abstract and dependant on external measures.
