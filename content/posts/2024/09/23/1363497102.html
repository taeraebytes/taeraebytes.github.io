      <p>Yeah sqr jp but tbh I get it though because if wakeone has lost the in ears that’s hundreds of dollars down the drain. At least they can’t try get wakeone to reimburse them or pay for a new sey</p>

      <p>oh I thought they were only threatening to so I guess they're going through with it but yea makes sense losing an in ear when it's the time period he should be using it would upset anyone
