      <p>we've been over this but it's still pissing me off like were all the variety/promo spots for this comeback period filled in by oh my girl/fromis/nmixx/fuckass sf9????????? ðŸ˜­ and people mention the tour but when has wakeone ever cared about overworking?????????? hao also expressed wanting to go on variety in his live last night and usually i'm not one to care about the victim olympics but it is a bit wild that he hasn't had one this comeback and his korean is clearly fine like put him on youngji's show like he said he wanted to go on.. and radio shows don't even take that much out of them it's just sitting and talking..... weekly idol could've definitely been filmed pre-cb but clearly it's too late for that now...... just STUPID ðŸ˜­</p>
