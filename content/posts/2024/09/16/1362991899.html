      <p>like im sorry hes not stuoid why would he say that and leave a weird ending to it and if he truly is restricted he wouldnt have said it in the first place i rlly think he uses this as a way to fill in his slack cuz lets b real he would never in a million yrs be active and thats fine but mmmm i didnt like that he was getting tore up by his kfans for it tho they think he should stop saying stuff like this cuz it doesnt change

      <p>he didn't deserve the amount of heat he got from kfans agreed but i definitely side eyed him for that things would be so much easier for all his fans if he was upfront about how active he chooses to be</p>

      <p>my bad my wording was off i shouldve added a comma or smth i meant i didnt like that he made it seem like he has the intention to be super active. i dont rlly have an opinion on the fan reaction i kinda greed with what they were saying in dc it was just a lot of frustration but his fans are still supporting him so theres that
