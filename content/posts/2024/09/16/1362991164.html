      <p>did u see that nowadays member say that he carries around a hanbin photocard like a talisman or something idk i didn't continue reading the tweets bc it grossed me out like oh my god yes ur friends with hanbin but he left ur company 2 years ago and all u talk about is hanbin bc the cheques aren't coming in we get it but something about hanbin attracts the glazers and tweakers (matthew treated him like his idol at some point in time but he's the only normal one out of the glazers.. i love real friendship. others who fit one of these 2 categories are gyuvin and myungjae) ðŸ˜­ it rubbed off on hb a tiny bit clearly but he's not as bad as the rest</p>

      <p>that same nowadays member said the other day that hanbin was his role model to the point on where another member of his group also knew about it and he was like siyun always talks about how hb is the perfect idol.

he's surrounded by a bunch of people that will gas him up no matter what, and they treat him like a god. even zh who is normal told him once that he changed and became a better person bc of him.

at some point he needs to be weirded out too</p>
