 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>groups donâ€™t work in yuehua, i doubt hao will debut in one, he will go straight to china and be pushed as solo, china is where the money is</p>

      <p>I can see him going solo and that's what I always had in mind but more recently I'm starting to think there's intention for a group

      <p>I feel like Ricky is also the most likely to leave and also has the money to back that up more than the others</p>

      <p>Idk why Ricky is a really good performer and I donâ€™t think heâ€™s doing bad job by any means but I always feel like he doesnâ€™t give kpop idol vibes</p>

      <p>there's no doubt to me that he loves performing and being a kpop idol but hes just strict about clocking off. a lot of kpop stans expect kpop idols to be kpop idols 24/7 and most idols are like that but to him ig he needs balance with being an idol and being himself. plus idt hes big on the parasocial thing that comes with being a kpop idol where he would rather risk losing his fans than please some sasaengs or some schizos which sucks for real fans</p>

      <p>he values his personal time the most being an idol means the lines of being on and off are blurred since they're literally selling themselves but he's just not the type and thats okay
