      <p>yall r using haechan and mark as examples when i keep saying it takes a specific kind of person... THEYRE THE SPECIFIC KINDA PPL IM TALKING AB ðŸ˜­ i could tell from the very beginning they'd be fucking their fans like it's very telling in their behavior and I just don't see that in zb1 not saying that's the only tell tale sign they could be getting down and dirty it would just be extremely surprising

      <p>i mean look im not trynna defend them but it should really be no surprise that the repressive yet fetishistic kpop culture creates perverted men, even out of men you wouldnt expect bc maybe they didnt expect it of themselves either. like i really wonder what it does to specifically the male psyche to be acting all virginal publicly into your late 20s. again not condoning just not condemning bc well im a realist and i wont let myself be shocked, not when i understand male nature and fan/groupie culture for what they've always been.</p>

      <p>No I get it and I do think obviously idol culture on top of  Korean society (for the native idols) produces these perverts and I kinda assume it anyways but just based off of who's been known to and been exposed there's a similar strain in every single one. Take riku for example he hasn't been exposed but it's pretty obvious he's the type idk zb1s business obviously there's just no alarm bells ringing in my head when it comes to signs they also have the worst luck and would probably get caught up with quickness ðŸ˜­

      <p>No i literally think about this all the time like for bgs at fansigns they are greeted by pretty and stunning girls who would drop everyting to be with them ðŸ˜­ plus all the hand holding and flirting. Meanwhile ggs usually have the worst kinda species of male following them</p>

      <p>it's so much easier for bgs obviously the standard is set high for fan girls and men just generally would sleep with fans it's very common so there's a chance there but male gg fans are usually some of the dirtiest fugliest biggest creatures ever like where all the peng guys at?

      <p>Not shading but some of these fansign gurlies look really pretty from the back with their silky hair and floral blouses but their faces are average, they just know how to decorate themselves unlike gg male fans who completely let themselves go.

From being in kpop for awhile most of these fan daters happen with smaller nugu groups because they have a lot of spare time in between comebacks and need ego boosts to make themselves feel relevant because their group isn't giving that dopamine. As for one night stands with fans tbh I feel like a few bad apples and wattpad y/n scenarios ruined the image of bgs because most aren't stupid to risk years of hard work for one night of pleasure and you really need a certain kink to sleep around like that, usually again goes back to ego because they know they're an idol and they know how easily their fans will drop to their knees to sleep with them and that feeds into their narcissistic ego and also some power trip kink too. Like it really takes a special breed that needs constant ego boost and abuses their power to do those stuff.

But like another anon mentioned below, bg are human as well so ofc they want to love and date but I feel like dating their peers is more common since both sides are in the same industry and will face the same risk and understand each other schedules, and dating fans is last resort unless you really desperate and lonely and sleeping with fans is even less likely and as I said needs a special kind of breed to do that kinda stuff.</p>

      <p>Well yea that's because of the maintenance standard it's darn high for bg fans but lmao yea bigger idols almost never date fans fellow idols is also not as common as one would think it's almost always someone that's within their realm of work and whatever personal life they kept intact. And yea that's what I meant initially it takes a certain type to frequent that and I just don't see any of that with the group and exactly they're still human and men sure something could go down but I don't see it being anything bad outside of regular boy band tour rushes and even then that's still not likely or anything there's risks. Pretty much in general it's hard to date or sleep w fans and if it's not it's a personality thing for that idol

also so right about the y/n thing which i blame tiktok for, they be saying everything and anything with no proof other than the fact that they went to their concert but if u really did sign a nda u wouldnt be talking bout it in the first place let alone show ur damn face ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like logic aint logicing and tiktokers / kpop stans eat it up because most are gf stans and those kinda tiktoks gets good engagement.

i think japanese male gg stans are the most well kept and know how to dress themselves, ive seen some ive fansigns and they look like those japanese male hostess at least from the back lmao</p>
