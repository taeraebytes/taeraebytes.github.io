      <p>It's really fucking ridiculous wakeone will push hanbin in every direction meanwhile zhang hao is restricted to endorsements and the occasional chinese schedule and being a token foreigner and then every time he gets a new schedule, he flaunts it to his fans the day before and how his manager told him to do a good job god fuck this guy</p>

      <p>I understand the argument of domestic versus Chinese schedules but there comes a point when that's not even the base argument and also just anger like idk what to say it sucks but there was almost no promo for the group or any of the members rlly and now they're on tour why don't we move on that's all we'll be getting for the next few months till they do their Japanese release

      <p>no but do you guys not question how one member can have so much freedom while with the other members there's always some dumb excuse as to why it's "not possible"? as long as the push exists, it's going to get worse and worse until they disband

and btw zeroses get more pissed about us pointing out the fact than the staff clearly only being committed to one person's career and it's ridiculous

this man gets at least 2-3 updates a day, the rest of the members don't even get 1 fucking update per day or 1 twitter post per month</p>

      <p>first and foremost u need to drop the assumption that everyone is under an illusion maybe on Twitter but if u lurk here u know damnnn well üò≠ if we're not in September 2023 lows then no it's not getting worse and worse I would actually kill myself if we were back to that idk what worse is to u but that's certainly not the case to me I don't care to rehash a century old argument and it's my fault for opening Pandora's box but I'm gonna keep my peace like there's is literally nothing fresh about this topic and I'm sooooooo over it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è using posting activity or plus chat isn't going to get u anywhere either because it has nothing to do with what ur talking about please air ur grievances elsewhere
