      <p>yall r using haechan and mark as examples when i keep saying it takes a specific kind of person... THEYRE THE SPECIFIC KINDA PPL IM TALKING AB 😭 i could tell from the very beginning they'd be fucking their fans like it's very telling in their behavior and I just don't see that in zb1 not saying that's the only tell tale sign they could be getting down and dirty it would just be extremely surprising

      <p>ijbol u clocked mk and hc whorish behaviour from the start 😭 usually they are always excused by their fandoms as “being too busy to date” 💀 but ain’t that the point, idols are never too busy to hoe around</p>

      <p>Also being a whore doesn't make you a bad person or a pervert 😭 
Hao, Yujin and Gunwook give serial daters to me but that also doesn't make them assholes they just give that one friend who's never single 
I'm sure some members are promiscuous but that doesn't mean they're pervert or fucking fans or whatver they could just be active in their relationships or otherwise, being a freak isn't a crime!!!!</p>

      <p>yeah nothing inherently unethical with dating if theyre both adults and if a fan is ballsy enough to pursue an idol romantically theyre likely already in that scene or at a certain status and know what theyre getting themselves into. even with power balances considered you cant just strip them of their individual agency, dynamics like that should be taken case by case and not interpreted to fit the most convenient narratives.

tbh i'd also say hooking up with fans isnt always bad either it's just much dicier bc there are too many incentives for both parties to be dishonest and messy in their motives and feelings (the idol stringing the fan along acting like they want a relationship then ditching them after sex; the fan claiming to be ok with no strings attached then wanting revenge for their own dissatisfaction/regret).

(Also pervert is a neutral word in my world 🤷‍♀️)</p>
