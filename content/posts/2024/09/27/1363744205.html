      <p>yall r using haechan and mark as examples when i keep saying it takes a specific kind of person... THEYRE THE SPECIFIC KINDA PPL IM TALKING AB ðŸ˜­ i could tell from the very beginning they'd be fucking their fans like it's very telling in their behavior and I just don't see that in zb1 not saying that's the only tell tale sign they could be getting down and dirty it would just be extremely surprising

      <p>i mean look im not trynna defend them but it should really be no surprise that the repressive yet fetishistic kpop culture creates perverted men, even out of men you wouldnt expect bc maybe they didnt expect it of themselves either. like i really wonder what it does to specifically the male psyche to be acting all virginal publicly into your late 20s. again not condoning just not condemning bc well im a realist and i wont let myself be shocked, not when i understand male nature and fan/groupie culture for what they've always been.</p>

      <p>No I get it and I do think obviously idol culture on top of  Korean society (for the native idols) produces these perverts and I kinda assume it anyways but just based off of who's been known to and been exposed there's a similar strain in every single one. Take riku for example he hasn't been exposed but it's pretty obvious he's the type idk zb1s business obviously there's just no alarm bells ringing in my head when it comes to signs they also have the worst luck and would probably get caught up with quickness ðŸ˜­

      <p>No i literally think about this all the time like for bgs at fansigns they are greeted by pretty and stunning girls who would drop everyting to be with them ðŸ˜­ plus all the hand holding and flirting. Meanwhile ggs usually have the worst kinda species of male following them</p>

      <p>it's so much easier for bgs obviously the standard is set high for fan girls and men just generally would sleep with fans it's very common so there's a chance there but male gg fans are usually some of the dirtiest fugliest biggest creatures ever like where all the peng guys at?
