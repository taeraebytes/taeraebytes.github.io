      <p>It is but like Requeef said they don‚Äôt want him to look tooo good like unearthly. If you watch a fashion show the models you see in there are extremely good looking but not so good looking they look AI whereas in editorial you see the ones who look so good they don‚Äôt look real</p>

      <p>You can be attractive and a runway model but ur face isn't meant to stand out or distract from the clothes or ur walk so for someone like Ricky it's like ehhh but his shoulders can stay as they are they don't need to get bigger üò≠

      <p>conventional beauty really depends on the country's beauty standard tho, an actress can be consider beautiful in her own country but in another country she'd be mid. whereas for models their beauty can be appreciated no matter race or ethnicity imo, unless you a hater that is then your opinion is irrelevant to begin with because it's not objective.</p>

      <p>Exactlyyyyyyy actors standards are usually contained within their country while models feel more universal like I'm sorry I will always find models more beautiful than actors
