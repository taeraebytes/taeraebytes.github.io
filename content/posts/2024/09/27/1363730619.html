 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>Also wasnâ€™t Ravi (the ceo) from jellyfish ergo he probably knew Gunwook when he was a trainee (if the timelines match) and they have a good hip hop label from what I hear groovlin</p>

      <p>I highly doubt it and even if the timelines matched why would Ravi kick it with a trainee

      <p>sometimes older groups are present in traineesâ€˜ evaluations though and they evaluate, it isnâ€™t weird to think they know trainees in their companies, espcieslly if they have huge roles I.e. like hui or even ravi</p>

      <p>It's possible but the chances are low in my opinion neither hanbin or Matthew were in cube long term and wasn't hui in the military during that time? and Ravi was pretty much up and out of jwllyfish when gunwook joined no?
