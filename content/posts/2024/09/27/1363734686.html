      <p>It's really fucking ridiculous wakeone will push hanbin in every direction meanwhile zhang hao is restricted to endorsements and the occasional chinese schedule and being a token foreigner and then every time he gets a new schedule, he flaunts it to his fans the day before and how his manager told him to do a good job god fuck this guy</p>

      <p>I understand the argument of domestic versus Chinese schedules but there comes a point when that's not even the base argument and also just anger like idk what to say it sucks but there was almost no promo for the group or any of the members rlly and now they're on tour why don't we move on that's all we'll be getting for the next few months till they do their Japanese release
