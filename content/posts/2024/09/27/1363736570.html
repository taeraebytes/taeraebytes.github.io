      <p>It's really fucking ridiculous wakeone will push hanbin in every direction meanwhile zhang hao is restricted to endorsements and the occasional chinese schedule and being a token foreigner and then every time he gets a new schedule, he flaunts it to his fans the day before and how his manager told him to do a good job god fuck this guy</p>

      <p>I understand the argument of domestic versus Chinese schedules but there comes a point when that's not even the base argument and also just anger like idk what to say it sucks but there was almost no promo for the group or any of the members rlly and now they're on tour why don't we move on that's all we'll be getting for the next few months till they do their Japanese release

      <p>I don't get what you mean when clearly all the industry connections are only going to him, he's the only one who's genuinely been giving the opportunity to grow his career through multiple channels and the gigs will only get better because of the investment while the rest of the group is being left in the dust</p>

      <p>unless you see him grow to lengths where he has a huge gap with the rest of the group in fame then what does it matter none of us will care once the group disbands and he can have all the connections he wants his fate post disbandment is the same as everyone else's in fact his prospects are probably 3rd best like I'm sorry I just don't care you guys are trying to talk to me like I haven't witnessed and discussed every angle and possibility to this argument I can't tell if you're just trying to annoy me but but you sound like a broken record and I've made it clear I don't care this conversation is dull and redundant please please pleaseeeee if you're dying to talk in circles NOT IN MY INBOX PLEASE
