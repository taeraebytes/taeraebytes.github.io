      <p>It depends ik rosins needed to contact hao but i think that was because it involved things from his past, with jw and hb i dont think they had to get their consent because it was a malicious comment and defamation case</p>

      <p>Ahhhh that makes sense now I'm remembering we've talked about it before cuz they'd technically have to have hao confirm things and rumors from the past? yea totally different case with that

      <p>Hao's are both the rumors from the past and malicious comments but they're only doing those ones from Korea.

But the way most of his rumors comes from the c side ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>ehh it's chill they're focusing on korea because that's where he works right now and someone can sue on behalf of you, he can't sue anyone in china anyways since he's not physically in the country</p>

      <p>I am hearing alot about Hao antis and Hanbin antis getting sued but how come we never see actual proof of that? I know that Hanbins Company TheLive is helping the fans in suing people but with Hao its all his fans doing the job... I dont think that most of Haos cases will go through and if they go through most of them will be dismissed if its about his past</p>

      <p>you're not going to hear updates that's not how it really works you'll find out once everyone's sued or the case concludes obviously the parts pertaining to his past won't really go just cuz he'd have to literally confirm or deny those but the negativity that came as a result probably yes but idk we'll see
