      <p>diff anon and I'm that anon that went to see them at lax kcon this year and got jumped by zeroses anyways, only Ricky and Hao weren't wearing masks so I can only really give my opinion on them cause I saw them up close. 

Ricky is just handsome. if you see him up close, u see his nose hump, jaw bone, brow bone everything and his skin is really nice, if you think he looks good in pictures he looks way better in person and I will never understand the botched allegations because seriously if you see him up close his face is so 'imperfect' that it's naturally so handsome.

Hao is my bias and why I went there for and he was handsome too but lowkey bloated especially his chin ğŸ˜­ I also just hate it when he wears those 3D glasses specs, please let them go ğŸ˜­ It reminds mf of when I was a kid and 3D movies first became a thing and everything at school would pop the lenses out and wear the frames ğŸ˜­. Then I got shoved to the back but I remember seeing a glimpse of them all underneath their masks and Gyuvin, Ricky and Gunwook were noticeably tall, I remember going to see a group who allegedly has a 186cm member and he was shorter than Hao ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>This gonna be random but it's so funny I had to share cuz anon reminded me about kconla. My briize moot hated ricky cuz of stupid fanwars until she saw him in person at kconla ASJSDAFLJASDLFHAASDEFADSWasdfkljs she went day1 for taemin (shes a sm stan...) and was walking around the convention center and zb1 was doing one of those connecting stages so I asked if she could take some pics and vids of matthew for me (I'm east coast so travelling all the way to la + kcon tickets was gonna be $$$ srry im too broke and kcon prices went up like why) and she did but she kept panning to fucking ricky and kept saying how he was so sweet always doing hearts and stuff to fans even on stage and then after for the main stage zb1 had a special perf and she kept live texting me how hot he was ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ he was sleeveless that day iirc and then at the end he walked past her and she did the half heart thing and he did it back ASDKSHFLSAHFLAKSDH omfg this bitch I cna't with her but she said he had the sweetest innocent gen smile and she felt sick to her stomach cuz she was hating on him online but yeah she's lowkey a ricky stan now

she said seeing an idol irl is so life changing cuz u realize these fanwars online are stupid af and idols are indeed human then she had an entire reflection session on her online behavior ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>
