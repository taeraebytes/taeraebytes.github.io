      <p>sorry queef ik you're shutting this convo down but some of you hyperfocus on hanbin soooooo much it's scary as if he's not just another one of #those members in a group that are inevitably everywhere and are just very marketable for benefits of both the company and the parties endorsing him. reminds me of when i stanned nct and solos/akgaes would cry daily about idk fuckass taeil barely getting gigs while doyoung and jaehyun always had something going on bitch DUH!</p>

      <p>This comparison doesn't work just cuz they all entered this group with popularity they're different from a group that started from scratch and built it as it went let's just leave it here at the hyperfocusing I just felt like I had to put that part in but IM LEAVING IT HERE.
