      <p>ok i'm so sorry for being the friend that's too woke but some of y'all need to learn about how closeting exists and how gay ppl like... work LMAO bc i like 99% think gunwook and matthew are straight so it doesn't necessarily apply to them but i've seen this reasoning with every idol ever (that they're straight bc they did y/n fan service in official content) but it's not like them, or any idol for that matter, could just 'confirm' that they're gay (even then, the times idols have been speculated to have done that it's been debated on bc none of them actually come out and none of them ever will like that's literally just being realistic, gay rights is going at a snail's pace over there) and then on top of that being attracted to women doesn't immediately omit any attraction to men like c'mon guys i thought we were all tumblrinas üò≠</p>
