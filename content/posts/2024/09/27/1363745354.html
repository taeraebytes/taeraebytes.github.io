      <p>I feel like he's the kinda guy that shows his appreciation and love for fans by his efforts physically on stage by giving a good performance, fan service at concerts and airport appearance making sure he always presentable HENCE HIS FUCKING MOTTO 'JUST SHOW DONT TALK' omfg they really don't know him at all.

I used to be really into mbti's and his intp mbti fits him to a tea, antisocial af, stays true to themselves, disconnected, perfectionist and hates stating the obvious and being told what to do. Like no shit he loves and is thankful to his fans, we know that, he knows that and to ppl with that kind of personality there's really no need to state the obvious which can lead to misunderstandings but to intps they don't care about misunderstanding because they know what's true to themselves.</p>
