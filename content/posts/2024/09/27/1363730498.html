      <p>idk what it is but recently i've really been deeping how horrible of a company wakeone is like everyone's always going on about "fuck wakeone", it's basic everyday vocabulary with little to no thought given atp, but when you really take a step back and look at every little thing no matter how big or small (weird scheduling, that thing matthew said about their dorm lighting not being fixed, whatever goes on with ricky - tho i know some of it can seem like the boy who cried wolf, members never being protected by the mass hate they get, everything seeming so scripted and controlled etc etc) it's just all so bad. weirdly enough the thing that made me think about this more was getting non-zb1 groups on my fyp and seeing them living their lives so happily and it'll be the most basic things... like there was a clip of fromis (of all groups, i know) doing karaoke casually on a recent livestream and we don't even get the luxury of that LMAO</p>

      <p>ngl dude no company is gonna suit up and fix dorm lights like thats smth the members gotta do themselves and i rlly was surprised by how far people took it like yall never had a lightbulb burn out or the flip in the switch turn off ðŸ˜­? while wakeone definitely has had some of the most devastating sabotage ive seen purely from lack of staff and carelessness theyre very average to me trust me i know what an actual malicious company is like theyre your average incompetent old time kpop company. Their marketings still the worst tho so its always gonna be jarring to see what other groups got going on

      <p>what you are saying is true but I donâ€™t see why a manager (who is most probably living with Matthew and Ricky since they are only two) canâ€™t obviously move and fix it then</p>
