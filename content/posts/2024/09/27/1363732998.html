We talked about this before, but they aren't close close, but it's not like their Woonghao or anything. Also because it's a duo not a ship you aren't going to hear about all the moments unless you're paying close attention or following a duo account.",
    "reply": "Obviously I'm not watching either closely but there is a difference I feel like they had a pretty stagnant relationship for awhile obviously like u said not like woonghao but it's definitely boomed in recent months and after all that yuehua stuff sure they probably have grown closer it's just not organic in my opinion"

 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>groups donâ€™t work in yuehua, i doubt hao will debut in one, he will go straight to china and be pushed as solo, china is where the money is</p>

      <p>I can see him going solo and that's what I always had in mind but more recently I'm starting to think there's intention for a group

      <p>Oh my god, they definitely have, but their interactions aren't as hyped up on the i-side b/c yk people being called weird shippers for liking the duo. We talked about this before, but they aren't close close, but it's not like their Woonghao or anything. Also because it's a duo not a ship you aren't going to hear about all the moments unless you're paying close attention or following a duo account.</p>
