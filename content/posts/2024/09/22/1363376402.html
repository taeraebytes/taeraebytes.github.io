      <p>yeah its clearly inspired but dont really agree cause imo his is pretty original. The pose, elements, style are diff and his is holding a sword and staff hence it 'protecting' zeroses, so other than being an headless angel it's as original as it can get and honestly as an artist that's what art is about, being inspired and adding ur own originality/ beliefs and gd is what got him into kpop so another inspo.

i love art history it's my side tea so u can ignore this if u want ðŸ˜­ basically there's no such thing as 'original' art because art from ancient times till now are always inspired by other art/ artist. unless u high on speed then maybe u can create original art ðŸ˜­</p>
