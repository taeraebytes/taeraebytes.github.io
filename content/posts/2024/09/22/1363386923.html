topaz is gd fangirl. but it's typical guardian angel tattoo. the design pops up immediately when you google that. also his neck tat isn't jb inspired. they just have the same font, which btw is one of the most popular fonts for neck tattoos so.. ðŸ¥´ I'm tired of this narrative. also riyangis definitely did not learn anything from the jb situation cuz their dumbasses are about to get him dragged again WATCH</p>
