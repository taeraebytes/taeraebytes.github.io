      <p>As someone whoâ€™s going to take the bar exam soon imo itâ€™s not worth actually pursuing legal action on wakeone. I mean itâ€™s good to threaten them with it and try and get them to pay for new IEM fully if they have lost them or hopefully they can find them but the most thatâ€™s going to happen in court is that they just have to replace them and then the legal fees will just end up costing more than the IEMs would have in the first place</p>

      <p>im 50/50, yeah its gonna cost more so might as well crowd fund for new in ears BUT they already crowdfunding for it why do they have to again? wakeone fucked up and didnt even apologize for it yet or at least for causing an inconvenience since ricky was the only without new in ears intended for tour and shoulda say they gonna reimburse for new in ears but they did none of that.

its a waste both money and time but at least wakeone will now know it's not all talk like they're actually take action whether wasteful or not and im sure wakeone dont got time for that so maybe theyll do something soon.</p>
