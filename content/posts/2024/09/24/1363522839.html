      <p>I honestly came into this cc as soon as I saw that shoot (videos and all that) and I just have to get this off my chest. Hanbin just does not have a charismatic face ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m sorry heâ€™s never gonna be able to give off a cool aura, even less when heâ€™s TRYING to look cool. yâ€™all just need to pray he gets photoshoots that only require him to smile</p>

      <p>I think it makes it worse since he's worked with bigger mags solo so there's an automatic higher expectation but I can agree not everyone's gonna be great at editorial stuff I guess but I feel like he works w a better concept his post finale shoot from his company was really good I don't think this plain thing he's had going on works w him like they gotta switch it up
