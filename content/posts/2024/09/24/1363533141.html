      <p>I think itâ€™s because the main focus was supposed to be the jewellery so they kept the overall composition more simple ?</p>

      <p>that... I'm not a huge fashion buff but it's possible to have jewelry centered shoots thatre interesting and in his case while the styling was great it was way too simple interesting and simple can coexist that's pretty much the wwd shoot but hey idk who's setting these things up for his case
