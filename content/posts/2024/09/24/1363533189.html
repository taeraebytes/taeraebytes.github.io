 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him 🤕 this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>groups don’t work in yuehua, i doubt hao will debut in one, he will go straight to china and be pushed as solo, china is where the money is</p>

      <p>I can see him going solo and that's what I always had in mind but more recently I'm starting to think there's intention for a group

      <p>Someone said this in moons cc but looks at yuehuas history of groups. In every single one they have pulled the Chinese members out and sent them to China and they literally never came back. The only reason yiren came back is because he chn debut flopped and it wasn’t worth keeping her there. It’s clear as day what yuehua will do with hao and probably Ricky and it’s not like we want it and it’s not some crazy theory it’s literally based on what they have don’t to all their groups / Chinese idols so far.</p>

      <p>that's true but in this case hao is the most popular member in korea if they want to debut a group of their own that's gonna squash their chances
