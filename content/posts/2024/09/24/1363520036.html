      <p>was the appreciation segment on the spot? or did they prepare it before hand? I saw someone say hanbin prepared two speeches cause hanbin was worried someone was going to get left out due to them being 9 (only for it to be him I'm dyingg ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) but I feel like if it was prepared before hand staff woulda interfere and make someone write to hanbin to avoid drama.

thats why i think it was on the spot and whoever the members chose was who they really wanted to thank right then and there, also anyone has a link to the full segment I wanna see how the order went</p>
