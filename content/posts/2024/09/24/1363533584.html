He told that there was a picture that was his favorite and shows the image he wants to look before when the magazine feature was announced and everyone guessed it will be something cool. When I first saw the pics, I thought he would say the one with sleeveless but I was wrong. This choice is totally unexpected, there is literally nothing to see in this picture.",
