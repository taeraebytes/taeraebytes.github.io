 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>groups donâ€™t work in yuehua, i doubt hao will debut in one, he will go straight to china and be pushed as solo, china is where the money is</p>

      <p>I can see him going solo and that's what I always had in mind but more recently I'm starting to think there's intention for a group
