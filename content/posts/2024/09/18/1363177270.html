      <p>So lemme give a breakdown of the NCT Wish tea cuz Iâ€™m bored and canâ€™t sleep. Sion, the leader, acted degenerate af and had an actual b*ner during a live with the rest of his teammates while they were all huddled on a couch together, he kept readjusting and genuinely looked to be enjoying himself if you get what Iâ€™m hinting at. Like videos exist of it, thereâ€™s no denying it actually happened. Daeyoung/Jaehee (same person, just a name change) has been alleged to be a bully and has been dragged to hell for his looks but there hasnâ€™t been like good evidence for that yet and a lot of old classmates have been refuting that claim so imma say this is a half tea. Riku is just like insane, as in he goes wayyyyy too far with fans and encourages saesang behavior and genuinely feeds into their delusions. His fans were the ones that repopularized (didnâ€™t start it but did make it pop off recently) the trend of getting the idol name tattooed on their bottom lips that now a lot of crazy fans are doing to a bunch of different kpop artists. I think I gotta stress one more time, heâ€™s actively making already horrible SM saesangs worse every fansign and doesnâ€™t set boundaries in anything he says towards feeding their delusions. A lot of non fans and knetz think whatâ€™s he doing is dangerous (especially because the youngest members are like 16 or something), corny, and uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s all I know, but idk the Yushi tea (if someone does please share it!!!). Sakuya is chill tho and seems to be the one with the least controversies/the most normal guy, and Ryo is fine but does get dragged for his looks sometimes. Thatâ€™s all I got.</p>
