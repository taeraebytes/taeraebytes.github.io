      <p>Seeing 🍚 fans get excited for their first anniversary live as if the weird frat boy gonna attend…. It really is going to be make it or break it. If he doesn’t go to the first year anniversary he 100% is never coming back. Wonder how they’ll be running their mouth when they actually lose a member meanwhile even if we hate half the group zb1 stays as 9 ❤️</p>
