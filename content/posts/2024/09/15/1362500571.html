      <p>Do you think Gunwook would look good with facial hair? Or like, how would you rank the members on attractiveness if they theoretically has to grow facial hair. Mine, in order of worst looking with imaginary facial hair, would be:
1. Gyuvin (it would look so off, he just has a face that needs to be smooth idk)
2. Yujin (ðŸ˜¨ my brain refuses to actually even imagine what it would look like)
3. Taerae (ðŸ˜­ imagining his dimples covered up with hair is making me so uncomfortable)
4. Hanbin (no, just no)
5. Matthew (also just no)
6. Hao (just no, but maybe something clean cut and short would look good? I could see it working idk)
7. Jiwoong (itâ€™d look okay with his pronounced chin)
8. Gunwook (I can see it working with the right cut and if he had an undercut hairstyle on his head connecting it)
9. Ricky (argue with a wall heâ€™d look okay, borderline good, with some)</p>
