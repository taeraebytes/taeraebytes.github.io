    "question": "Yujin cracks me tf up sometimes he just be posting random shit on insta and acting like an edgy teen but like bunny themed? Either way you can tell being an idol isn’t what he thought it was all cracked up to be, that he finds 95% of things they gotta do ridiculous and funny, and that he isn’t taking himself too seriously. Honestly pretty refreshing. I hated that he got into ZB1 (thought he was too young back then) but like he’s a pretty alright and brings an unserious but relaxed energy to the group and he doesn’t make being a maknae his whole identity or act like a brat outside of sometimes when he jokes. He’s kinda chill idk, def my top 3 fave member and I really can see him getting huge post disbandment.",
    "reply": "hes just so chill fun and cute and i can appreciate his genuine improvement in dancing singing presence hes rlly the baby goat"
