Still hot tho donâ€™t get me wrong, his face has just matured a lot this past year and he looks so grown ðŸ˜­ like he looks like any dude at my college. Itâ€™s sort of refreshing he looks so human and not like an insane v-shaped, dental veneer, giant-eyed dolls the k-beauty industry and fans try to force on grown men through unnatural and super noticeable plastic surgery. \n\nx\ncom/bbopul/status/1833050777994371432?s=46",
