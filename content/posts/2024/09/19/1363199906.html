      <p>mmmm i think they made a good choice because regardless if they had spoken out or not their futures were doomed anyways so why not attempt to use ur fame and public reception to make demands and shed light. Im positive that mhj isnt getting reinstated as much as theyd like to new jeans dont have that power and hybe is mega ultra evillllll i was kinda shocked at how kpop fans were talking ab it like new jeans just ended themselves LIKE THAT WAS ALREADY HAPPENING and it felt like ppl were bowing to hybe w that sentiment ðŸ˜­ i feel bad for them
