      <p>did u see that nowadays member say that he carries around a hanbin photocard like a talisman or something idk i didn't continue reading the tweets bc it grossed me out like oh my god yes ur friends with hanbin but he left ur company 2 years ago and all u talk about is hanbin bc the cheques aren't coming in we get it but something about hanbin attracts the glazers and tweakers (matthew treated him like his idol at some point in time but he's the only normal one out of the glazers.. i love real friendship. others who fit one of these 2 categories are gyuvin and myungjae) ðŸ˜­ it rubbed off on hb a tiny bit clearly but he's not as bad as the rest</p>
