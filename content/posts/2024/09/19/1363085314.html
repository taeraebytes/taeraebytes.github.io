<a href="https://curiouscat.live/requeefiem/post/1362949191">https://curiouscat.live/requeefiem/post/1362949191</a> going off of this a bit more mmm i dont think hes evil hes just obviosuly not the active type and i feel like he should either own ir or work on it cuz it just feels lazy. like yes im not stupid nobody is truly free in posting theyre gonna have some form of restrictions thats what management is but acting like hes completely cut off or has the intention.. HES LYING DONT CARE!!!! and plus chat is easily tje platform they have the most control over gyuvin has his weekly coke rants im sure ricky can send a good morning lmao. but rukidans pretty much r saying the same thing and he was getting tore up on instiz dc and even the quotes of balloons og tweet

      <p>I think what he's doing now is basically him lowkey telling us his intention. Last time when Balloon made that post about him being inactive in April he came onto bubble right away and came like 4-5 times a week but it slowly became less and less, I think he realized this just aint him and this time I'm sure he's aware of what has happened, it's literally everywhere, on twitter, weibo, tiktok, douyin, xhs, dcgall and if not gyuvin would've surely told him if anything yet he only came once after that incident after their final gsb performance which I think was his intention to begin with. So I'm glad he's not doing what he did in April, coming to pluschat all of a sudden multiple times a week and hopefully his fans will get the hint.

I side with rukidans cause they long accepted him for who he is and they hate how intl fans keep pushing this issue making a problem out of nothing.</p>

      <p>maybe he just had to come up with smth quick for the fan in that fancall but i side with them too like theyve pretty much accepted his level activity and its obviously nothing like jaehyun. I can understand wanting more since its also an idol obligation but i guess for him hes just deciding to be authentic i feel like through interviews and just bits hes said himself hes been trying to make it known hes someone with strong conviction and he does what he wants but yea idk i doubt ifans would rlly catch on but his kfans get it
