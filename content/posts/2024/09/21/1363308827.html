They emailed on the 29th about dropping off his in ears and the company said their spot is for 3pm on the 2nd of sept. A rep from the China team has the in ears from the jp team and goes to deliver them, a female staff comes out and takes them in. I’m guessing they just got out with other gifts in a general area. Then later there is a fancall and Ricky is asked if he got the in ears, he says no then wakeone is emailed for some confirmation or clarity on where these in ears are.
