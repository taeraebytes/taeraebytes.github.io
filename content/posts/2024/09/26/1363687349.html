      <p>It depends ik rosins needed to contact hao but i think that was because it involved things from his past, with jw and hb i dont think they had to get their consent because it was a malicious comment and defamation case</p>

      <p>Ahhhh that makes sense now I'm remembering we've talked about it before cuz they'd technically have to have hao confirm things and rumors from the past? yea totally different case with that

      <p>Hao's are both the rumors from the past and malicious comments but they're only doing those ones from Korea.

But the way most of his rumors comes from the c side ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>ehh it's chill they're focusing on korea because that's where he works right now and someone can sue on behalf of you, he can't sue anyone in china anyways since he's not physically in the country</p>
