      <p>eh whatever I'm just gonna b honest I don't rlly like when I get called biased but for the right brands I think gunwook could kill it and Ricky I do see way more for editorial he could pull it off tho eh even gyuvin if he magically woke up with balance

      <p>ok one thing i think gunwook has that would work for runways is his naturally swaggering walk lmaoo he like saunters and i dont even think hes doing it on purpose either it's literally all the time. i think hes expressive in an idol/actor way though not a model way.</p>

      <p>I rmbr too he has a rlly powerful gaze and there's a list of brands I think really suit his aura and walking for them doesn't seem like it would be crazy I think for all the kpop idols that have ever walked jeno has done it the best and gunwook doesn't play about anything he'd practice real good ugh i sooo wish he could do the same thing and walk for peter do too
