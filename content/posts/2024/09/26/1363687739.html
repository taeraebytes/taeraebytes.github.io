      <p>diff anon and I'm that anon that went to see them at lax kcon this year and got jumped by zeroses anyways, only Ricky and Hao weren't wearing masks so I can only really give my opinion on them cause I saw them up close. 

Ricky is just handsome. if you see him up close, u see his nose hump, jaw bone, brow bone everything and his skin is really nice, if you think he looks good in pictures he looks way better in person and I will never understand the botched allegations because seriously if you see him up close his face is so 'imperfect' that it's naturally so handsome.

Hao is my bias and why I went there for and he was handsome too but lowkey bloated especially his chin ðŸ˜­ I also just hate it when he wears those 3D glasses specs, please let them go ðŸ˜­ It reminds mf of when I was a kid and 3D movies first became a thing and everything at school would pop the lenses out and wear the frames ðŸ˜­. Then I got shoved to the back but I remember seeing a glimpse of them all underneath their masks and Gyuvin, Ricky and Gunwook were noticeably tall, I remember going to see a group who allegedly has a 186cm member and he was shorter than Hao ðŸ˜­</p>
