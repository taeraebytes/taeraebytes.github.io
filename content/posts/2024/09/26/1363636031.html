      <p>it is zeroses actually there was a thread and most were zb1 related but of course army haters were in there

there is no reason to pray for him because armys did not jump him at all they were only questioning why everyone is shading them on the qts plus there is a tiktok that went semi viral as of now and everyone is positive there</p>
