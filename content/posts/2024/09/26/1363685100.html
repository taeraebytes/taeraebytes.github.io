      <p>no shade i cant tell these old korean men apart i see them once every few months but yea i noticed theres a couple bald guys which is so weird ðŸ˜­ but its not surprising theyre sharing and swapping managers it would be better if there was more creative staff than managers if you had to pick and choose
