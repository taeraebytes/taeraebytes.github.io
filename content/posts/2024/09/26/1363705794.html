 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him ðŸ¤• this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>I'm alright... but whatever plans yuehua has for the 4 of them is gonna be funny to witness like hmmm I'm curious but I don't want gunwook to be the odd one out in his new group

      <p>groups donâ€™t work in yuehua, i doubt hao will debut in one, he will go straight to china and be pushed as solo, china is where the money is</p>

      <p>I can see him going solo and that's what I always had in mind but more recently I'm starting to think there's intention for a group

      <p>Someone said this in moons cc but looks at yuehuas history of groups. In every single one they have pulled the Chinese members out and sent them to China and they literally never came back. The only reason yiren came back is because he chn debut flopped and it wasnâ€™t worth keeping her there. Itâ€™s clear as day what yuehua will do with hao and probably Ricky and itâ€™s not like we want it and itâ€™s not some crazy theory itâ€™s literally based on what they have donâ€™t to all their groups / Chinese idols so far.</p>

      <p>that's true but in this case hao is the most popular member in korea if they want to debut a group of their own that's gonna squash their chances

      <p>like we also need to consider that their past artists even yibo wasnâ€™t well known in korea thats why they were sent to china in the first place i think thats haoâ€™s advantage to them heâ€™s both the most popular member in china and korea its just up to them if they can handle both</p>
