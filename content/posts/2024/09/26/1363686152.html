      <p>It is but like Requeef said they donâ€™t want him to look tooo good like unearthly. If you watch a fashion show the models you see in there are extremely good looking but not so good looking they look AI whereas in editorial you see the ones who look so good they donâ€™t look real</p>

      <p>You can be attractive and a runway model but ur face isn't meant to stand out or distract from the clothes or ur walk so for someone like Ricky it's like ehhh but his shoulders can stay as they are they don't need to get bigger ðŸ˜­
