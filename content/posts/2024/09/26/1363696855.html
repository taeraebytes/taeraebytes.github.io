      <p>yall r using haechan and mark as examples when i keep saying it takes a specific kind of person... THEYRE THE SPECIFIC KINDA PPL IM TALKING AB 😭 i could tell from the very beginning they'd be fucking their fans like it's very telling in their behavior and I just don't see that in zb1 not saying that's the only tell tale sign they could be getting down and dirty it would just be extremely surprising

      <p>ijbol u clocked mk and hc whorish behaviour from the start 😭 usually they are always excused by their fandoms as “being too busy to date” 💀 but ain’t that the point, idols are never too busy to hoe around</p>

      <p>Also being a whore doesn't make you a bad person or a pervert 😭 
Hao, Yujin and Gunwook give serial daters to me but that also doesn't make them assholes they just give that one friend who's never single 
I'm sure some members are promiscuous but that doesn't mean they're pervert or fucking fans or whatver they could just be active in their relationships or otherwise, being a freak isn't a crime!!!!</p>
