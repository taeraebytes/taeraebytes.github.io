 lowkey this hit hard bc let's be real.. his future prospects are a bit questionable like all the jelpiz he did bp with left his company and jellyfish in general has had its complaints over the years, like what exactly is planned for him 🤕 this isn't a yuehua or studio gl1de situation (and i'm sure some other members could feel similarly) ugh i wish he didn't feel so worried</p>

      <p>Also wasn’t Ravi (the ceo) from jellyfish ergo he probably knew Gunwook when he was a trainee (if the timelines match) and they have a good hip hop label from what I hear groovlin</p>

      <p>I highly doubt it and even if the timelines matched why would Ravi kick it with a trainee

      <p>No offense but what sway or clout does ravi have that would make his endorsement worth something? didnt he tank his rep due to military evasion? idk the details he may have been misunderstood and i dont partake in canceling i just know they dont play abt that stuff over there</p>

      <p>Not to be a shooter for Ravi I just know this because I was into vixx but he didn’t get convicted for anything and he isn’t in jail nor is he going to jail. Kpop twt really took one thing and spread their own narrative onto it but 99.9% of things people think they know about his case aren’t even true😭</p>
