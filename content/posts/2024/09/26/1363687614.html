      <p>diff anon and I'm that anon that went to see them at lax kcon this year and got jumped by zeroses anyways, only Ricky and Hao weren't wearing masks so I can only really give my opinion on them cause I saw them up close. 

Ricky is just handsome. if you see him up close, u see his nose hump, jaw bone, brow bone everything and his skin is really nice, if you think he looks good in pictures he looks way better in person and I will never understand the botched allegations because seriously if you see him up close his face is so 'imperfect' that it's naturally so handsome.

Hao is my bias and why I went there for and he was handsome too but lowkey bloated especially his chin 😭 I also just hate it when he wears those 3D glasses specs, please let them go 😭 It reminds mf of when I was a kid and 3D movies first became a thing and everything at school would pop the lenses out and wear the frames 😭. Then I got shoved to the back but I remember seeing a glimpse of them all underneath their masks and Gyuvin, Ricky and Gunwook were noticeably tall, I remember going to see a group who allegedly has a 186cm member and he was shorter than Hao 😭</p>

I think everyone should see Ricky irl up close at least once tbh, his tzone hits you and I still remember it vividly. Idk what that hump is on the nose bridge called but it's really pretty and you can only see it at a certain angle also his jawline and lips omg. 

omg I was lowkey crying when you and your anons were roasting Hao and his puffy face especially at the music core thing 😭😭 whatever I'm not mad cause I was ranting to my moots about it too idk what happened either be he needed to stop 😭 I want to see Gunwook toooooooo ugh I was going to go again when they came for Krazy but I had school...</p>
