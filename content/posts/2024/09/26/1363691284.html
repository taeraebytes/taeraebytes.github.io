      <p>I haaaate seeing taerae dance like at first I was gonna give him grace and be like “well he’s still learning and he’s the main vocal so he gets a bit of a pass, he’ll get better eventually” but he’s barely gotten better at all and it’s been over a year??? It just sticks out so much and anytime it’s his time to perform it literally irritates me his lines aren’t as clean, his movements not as agile and his balance is off. Like you can dance like a twink and still have amazing technicalities (such as Hao). He just isn’t good and it’s so 😶🔫 don’t give people another reason to drag ZB1.</p>
