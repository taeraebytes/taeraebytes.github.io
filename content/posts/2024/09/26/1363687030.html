      <p>guys are h o r n d o g s , whether they are straight/not, all of those idols r doing the nasty even when they are busy, like mark, haechan despite being in 2 units, always have time for dating and sleeping around</p>

      <p>yall r using haechan and mark as examples when i keep saying it takes a specific kind of person... THEYRE THE SPECIFIC KINDA PPL IM TALKING AB ðŸ˜­ i could tell from the very beginning they'd be fucking their fans like it's very telling in their behavior and I just don't see that in zb1 not saying that's the only tell tale sign they could be getting down and dirty it would just be extremely surprising

      <p>i mean look im not trynna defend them but it should really be no surprise that the repressive yet fetishistic kpop culture creates perverted men, even out of men you wouldnt expect bc maybe they didnt expect it of themselves either. like i really wonder what it does to specifically the male psyche to be acting all virginal publicly into your late 20s. again not condoning just not condemning bc well im a realist and i wont let myself be shocked, not when i understand male nature and fan/groupie culture for what they've always been.</p>

      <p>No I get it and I do think obviously idol culture on top of  Korean society (for the native idols) produces these perverts and I kinda assume it anyways but just based off of who's been known to and been exposed there's a similar strain in every single one. Take riku for example he hasn't been exposed but it's pretty obvious he's the type idk zb1s business obviously there's just no alarm bells ringing in my head when it comes to signs they also have the worst luck and would probably get caught up with quickness ðŸ˜­
