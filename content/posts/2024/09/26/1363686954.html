      <p>yeah high fashion/runway is all about delicate ageless adrogyny and cool yet ultimately blank expressions. Kpop idols are too pretty and tend toward overt charismatic expressions that center their personas rather than serve as vehicles for abstract concepts (ricky is so guilty here lmao). I actually think yujin has the most high fashion vehicular face in the group (maybe more so when hes older) but hes too short and lacks that prolonged intensity in his eyes.</p>
