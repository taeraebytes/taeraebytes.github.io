      <p>yeah high fashion/runway is all about delicate ageless adrogyny and cool yet ultimately blank expressions. Kpop idols are too pretty and tend toward overt charismatic expressions that center their personas rather than serve as vehicles for abstract concepts (ricky is so guilty here lmao). I actually think yujin has the most high fashion vehicular face in the group (maybe more so when hes older) but hes too short and lacks that prolonged intensity in his eyes.</p>

      <p>yujin isnâ€™t short. isnâ€™t he like 5â€™10 which is fine for model height and also there are shorter models like kate moss, bella hadid</p>

      <p>dont want to pull the gender card but kate moss and bella hadid are females with female anatomy and modelling clothes for the female anatomy and yujin is a male, usually brands prefer taller, broader physiques because they show of the clothes better</p>

      <p>that's literally just facts men are taller than women so the standards are gonna be stricter on height for male models

      <p>plus using kate moss as an example is just wild. that woman was a generational modeling talent who defined a whole era and her height made her even more  singular at the time. i feel a little bad for her daughter who yes is a nepo baby but was also doomed to never live up to her.</p>
