    "question": "The Gunwook hate drives me absolutely insane because all of it stems from one fucking thing: the Korean beauty standards. It isn’t his comments or behavior, and anything “attitude” related controversy is clearly bull. All the insults after they are finishing over analyzing any of his actions always go back to his looks. They hate that he doesn’t have a rhinoplasty-ed nose, that his head isn’t as small as a chihuahua, and that he isn’t super scrawny. It’s literally so stupid because he’s like very hot and handsome and probably more healthy than anyone else in the team besides maybe Matthew. And even outside of his looks, he has such an amazing personality. He clearly loves people, he isn’t immature, he’s dependable, reliable, actually can dance and sing and rap, he’s great at public speaking and is actually friendly. If he did even a tenth of what Gyuvin does he’d be killed. Or if he made the body shaming comments Hao or hanbin have done he’d be crucified. It’s probably one of the most unwarranted hate trains towards a male idol I’ve ever seen. He gets the most unwarranted hate out of all 5th Gen male idols and I mean it. It’s just so bizarre to watch play out and idc I’m willing to become a crazy ass akgae if it means calling out stupid comments from people against him.",
    "reply": "It's just soooooo insane to me like he doesn't conform to the current standard but people still like him and find him super attractive like wow DOES THAT KILL YALL OR SMTH OMG 🤬🤦‍♀️ it really is one of the worst male idol hate trains I've ever seen and everyday he just proves himself to be better than he was before it's so heartbreaking like there is nothing he or anyone could do to make them stop they just gotta stop on their own which... yea like everyone always wonders why I'm a crash out THERES A REASON!!!!!!!!!!"
