      <p>They're not it was never really about the strawberry it's just people projecting and airing out their grievances on top of the fact that they already hate and bully him if it was another idol this would've been over in a few hours it was seriously never about the strawberry for these people like I'm sorry reaching all forums and have WRITTEN ARTICLES..?????? They need to get a grip
