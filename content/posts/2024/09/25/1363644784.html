      <p>Someone actually theories that hanbin and gyuvin have actually been invited to walk the show for miss gee collection because apparently they do menswear and eunwoo walked for them in 2021 and the ig page just followed the zb1 official account which I donâ€™t think they would do if they were just attending</p>
