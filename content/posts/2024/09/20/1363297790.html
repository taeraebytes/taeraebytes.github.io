      <p>Ricky's japanese fanbase organized in-ears for him and rushed to get them delivered before the tour. They scheduled with wakeone to deliver it on 9/2 at 3pm and left it outside the door and called the company coordinator, basically did everything they were supposed to. Somebody asked ricky if he got them at the fansign and he said no so they asked wakeone about it. Turns out wakeone has no idea where it is and only flippantly emailed back after five days, day before the comeback to tell jp fb that they didn't receive it or it probably got mixed up with other gifts.

      <p>Ok icl if the Japan fanbase people just left it outside without making sure someone came out to get it then itâ€™s their fault if it got stolen because who in their right minds leaves hundreds of dollars worth of goods on the street floor. But also if they did take it in the it probably just got mixed up with another groups shit and it will have his name on it so will make its way back to him, they really have no need to keep something like this away from him because of his current ones get damaged itâ€™s just money out their own pockets to repair them</p>
