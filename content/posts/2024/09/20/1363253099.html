      <p>I feel like no one has really asked you so I wanted to ask because I‚Äôm curious and love to hear what people say to this question: what made your bias become your bias? Like what are some reasons you like Gunwook? And was there a definitive moment where you were like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs now my fave‚Äù or was it over time? üòä</p>

      <p>I think probably a very long time ago but I'm happy to answer I love this question I'm a bp gunwook stan üòù he wasn't initially my preshow or one pick for some of the show but I liked him and thought he was cool it wasn't until around Tom boy where I decided I'm leaving my one pick for dead and giving gunwook my life he was just so talented and handsome and charismatic AND HE WAS SO FUNNY idc we had to stand ten toes down for him he was saying nothing but the truth. I pretty much found myself trying to learn everything about him and every new fact just made me love him more and I love cry babies he's just the best person to me I even dropped my ult of like almost 4 years IT WAS OVER FOR CHANGMIN THIS IS THEEEEE GOAT I've been a kpop fan for a long time but this is probably the hardest I've ever gone
