      <p>are zeroses all teenagers? i dont wanna sound mean cuz i know pretty much every kpop fandom behaves this way but gooddd I'm tired of the corny mpreg jokes and how much they want zb1 to do "girl group music" ( whatever this means) like I already stan ggs and they make great gg music so if im stanning a boy group I want them to do good bg music idk let's reject modernity and embrace tradition and also they should stop soft calling zb1 members faggots cuz that attracts the worst possible people on stan twitter: nsfw gay twitter</p>

      <p>yea a good chunk of the public mainstream twt fandom are teens but you'd also be surprised at how many of them are grown too it's a mix of a lot of things. Zeroses are just are cornier fandom and no shade everyone's a twitter gay so this certain aspect is just heightened but I've like completely separated myself from that a longgg time ago
