      <p>bruh i just saw that a few fantasy boys members are already on a new survival show (ma jingxiang and jang yeojun are too which is kinda crazy) which is so ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. that plus rtk2 with all these bg members who have already been through the ringer on survival shows is making me think of post-disbandment when various zb1 members will inevitably go on other survival shows yet again omg post-disbandment could potentially be so bad for them like we can't do this. when hanbin is the mc of some mnet survival show and yuehuaz go on LMFAOOOOOOOO</p>
