      <p>They don’t like the sexy concept the k side much prefer the good boy soft side of him which is really interesting actually. I’m quite curious if kfans prefer that in general or if it’s just his kfans prefer that side of him.</p>

      <p>I think it might be his kfans specifically just cuz that's the song that made Ricky and hao more popular in korea and gunwooks kfans were losing their fucking minds I don't think it's generally a kfan thing but it's true they do prefer sexy less

      <p>Dc is interesting I feel like it's where every sf goes to tweak over things like styling or when they have complaints with their idol so definitely stuff you wouldn't see on twitter</p>
