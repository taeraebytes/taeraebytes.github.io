      <p>uhhh i didn't look too closely but if you check ricky's japanese fanbase they posted something about sending in-ears to wakeone and getting confirmation of receipt a few weeks ago but then ricky said he never got them in a fancall, then wakeone emailed back the fanbase and were like sorry maybe the gifts got lost amongst other gifts? or something like that other anons can add on</p>

      <p>The headmic and hand mic wonâ€™t be delivered till sometime in October ðŸ˜­ because his new cbar had to re fundraise for them so wake one donâ€™t event have it yet. I mean I guess they could have let him use the red one from that 1 sponsor but that would probably enrage his c fans, it feels like such a waste though</p>
