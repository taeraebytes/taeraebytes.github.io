      <p>uhhh i didn't look too closely but if you check ricky's japanese fanbase they posted something about sending in-ears to wakeone and getting confirmation of receipt a few weeks ago but then ricky said he never got them in a fancall, then wakeone emailed back the fanbase and were like sorry maybe the gifts got lost amongst other gifts? or something like that other anons can add on</p>
