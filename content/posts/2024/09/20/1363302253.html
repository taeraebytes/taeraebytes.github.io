      <p>uhhh i didn't look too closely but if you check ricky's japanese fanbase they posted something about sending in-ears to wakeone and getting confirmation of receipt a few weeks ago but then ricky said he never got them in a fancall, then wakeone emailed back the fanbase and were like sorry maybe the gifts got lost amongst other gifts? or something like that other anons can add on</p>

      <p>The headmic and hand mic wonâ€™t be delivered till sometime in October ðŸ˜­ because his new cbar had to re fundraise for them so wake one donâ€™t event have it yet. I mean I guess they could have let him use the red one from that 1 sponsor but that would probably enrage his c fans, it feels like such a waste though</p>

      <p>hell nah he aint touching the red mic at all his cfans gonna tweakkk, that 1 'sponsor' was a fan who scammed the cbar and lied so she could fundraise the mic herself, lowkey creepy cuz it sounds like her intent was so when ricky uses the mic itll make her feel special cuz she was the only one whos money actual went into the mic while the fans fundraised money was left out. so if he uses it, it's basically him siding with her even tho he probs doesnt know about the drama or backstory. hope wakeone does something smart and trash that mic.</p>
