      <p>Diff anon, Jfans fundraised and created the designs for rickys custom in ears, once ricky picked the design he liked and funds were raised by jfans they handed it over to someone in China who chinese (prob someone from cbar) because the in ear production is in China, once finished that person was going to travel to Korea and deliver it in person to wakeone and that's what allegedly happened early Sept.

But then the jfan asked ricky in a fancall recently if he received it and he said no, his j team then emailed wakeone and left them read until yesterday and was like u sure u gave it to us? Was it through carrier? Then said it mightve gotten mixed up with other gifts and wasn't delivered to ricky. 

Whole purpose for the in ears was so ricky can use them on tour so yeah... so either wakeone imcompetent again and lost his expensive in ears or the person who delivered it lied since they're from his cbar iirc, but they literally sent pics of them traveling to Korea and outside wakeone so idk.
