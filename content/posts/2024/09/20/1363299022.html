      <p>They donâ€™t like the sexy concept the k side much prefer the good boy soft side of him which is really interesting actually. Iâ€™m quite curious if kfans prefer that in general or if itâ€™s just his kfans prefer that side of him.</p>

      <p>I think it might be his kfans specifically just cuz that's the song that made Ricky and hao more popular in korea and gunwooks kfans were losing their fucking minds I don't think it's generally a kfan thing but it's true they do prefer sexy less
