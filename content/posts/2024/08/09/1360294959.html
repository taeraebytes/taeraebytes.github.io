Hariboz face cards really ate Ricky usally kill these face shoots and I've been liking his looks the most with the black but it's one of the rarer good teaser pics for Hao, the shot is uninteresting but his styling is amazing let's keep the dark styling jebal
I get the vision but like not even a filter really?????? If they added a little filter and played with the saturation it would've ate
Matthew looks like an IG pic
Hanbin and Yujin looks like candids you'd delete immediately and hanbins makeup isn't good
