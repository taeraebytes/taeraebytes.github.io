    "question": "Idk if you keep up with Fifty Fifty but like, they announced the new members and two of them were pretty known participants from R U  Next, including Chanelle. I went to the comment section of their most recent vid and all the comments are mostly in Korean, full of excitement and happiness. It‚Äôs just so depressing, seeing how it played out. The ex members are practically hated in Korea and will never work in entertainment again, the last OG member had to stay because she had a poor background and had no other option, the new members probably thought this was their last chance to debut, and the Korean public loves the CEO and the company cannot do anything wrong in their eyes, meaning ANY future issue with the girls and the public will drag them to hell. International fans might hate them but they‚Äôll be successful irregardless because of the Korean backing. Give it a year or two and I think the international side will either ignore it (if the music is good) or forget the issues and then just listen to them. Obviously injustice happens every day and kpop is super unethical but this case feels exceptionally depressing because like you also want to help the OG girl succeed because she literally needs to (she was still slapped with a huge fine for what she did, not nearly as big as the ex-members but something she‚Äôll need to work off for awhile). So it‚Äôs like, do you aid in abuse to help her or go against the institution that abuses her and in that processes, harm her and the other 4 desperate girls that will subjected to the company‚Äôs every whim with an even lesser ability than most idols to disagree with their company? It‚Äôs just so üôÅ",
    "reply": "I feel so bad for the girls that left because they were fined with MILLIONS like usd I didn't follow the case so I'm not sure how this happened but there's no way any of them can pay that back the situation seems sad the og girl had no choice and now the worst has happened. It'll be pretty weird to witness cuz I can see them having success in korea"
