      <p>Concerts are usually prepared 2-3months and here we have zb1 probably preparing for 10 days only because they need to promote their comeback and attend festivals. I'm worried about the quality of the concert... They prepared for Japan fancon for over 2 months btw</p>

      <p>Idk which groups you stan but almost all of the groups that I stanned started their tour just like 3 weeks after their comeback promos ended, it's kinda the standard lately tbh</p>

      <p>other groups that have time to prepare for the concert before the last comeback. But in ZB1's case, they came from May comeback and had to prepare for August comeback while doing festivals and hanbin with his aotm which probably ate so much time practicing. See the low quality of their psycho cover? That would tell you that they don't have time to spare to even make a better stage. What seoul will get are their usual set list, songs from Aug comeback and one unit cover. I mean, seeing the same performances for many times already and seeing them again in their concert is such a waste. It would be nice if 50% of their performance would be the songs they haven't performed yet.</p>

      <p>that's survival group nature. they wouldn't get ideal preparation, they just need to perform 20-30 songs without perfect stage direction/setting. the most fans looked are content of ment and their interaction with fans. they don't need stellar performance or decoration. i just worry about what content that wakeone will give to us.</p>
