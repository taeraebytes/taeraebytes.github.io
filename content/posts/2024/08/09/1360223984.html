      <p>The ability to be that self centered is crazy they rlly associate everything negative and bad with hao because how and why are they comparing me being mad to themselves it's like they jump at the thought of negativity ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­... lmaoooo gunwook started off in zb1 as a poorly treated member he's never had it easy so this shit isn't new talking ab some "how does it feel" WDNCCCCC they just expect everyone to be like them or care ab the things they care ab and it's actually so irksome to compare me to their unoriginal antics like please keep it to urselves why am I being brought up... like I didn't know my emotions were suddenly their business and ties back to their right to bitch #OBSESSED
