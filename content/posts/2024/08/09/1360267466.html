      <p>Allins: you’re homophobic for criticizing Hanbin or thinking he couldnt possibly be the best dancer ever!!! Anything you say that isn’t worshipping him is homophobic and you are a horrible person!!!!

They wonder why people hate them and why the fandom makes people not like Hanbin. Argue with a wall if you think fandoms don’t influence outside perceptions of idols. And like, do they not remember shotaro exists??? I don’t even like Riize and I genuinely dislike eunseok (don’t get me started on wackass Sungchan) but shotaro could outdance Hanbin in his sleep. Sorry dolls, your vapid one-dimensional hero worship of a man who clearly doesn’t want his queer art background coming to light, is, in fact, not a good thing too. Genuinely hoping now someone with a better tutting, whacking, and ballroom background debuts just so they shut the fawk up. Hanbin isn’t the end-all of talent. People can in fact be better than him and other dance styles in fact deserve respect.</p>
