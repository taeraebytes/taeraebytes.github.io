      <p>Idk why people think that mnet was like nah I am not giving you relay dance and studio choom when every group goes to that shit ðŸ˜­ it's not some exclusive content or sumn, to me it was more obvious that probably Wakeone didn't schedule shit properly bc even the promo was shit in the first place. The only decent content was Hanbin at Lee Mujin and Gyuvin at KODE.</p>

      <p>that's what I think as well I don't think they were barred like cmon it's wakeone but they did get studio choom for ftp I guess the relay just wasn't important
