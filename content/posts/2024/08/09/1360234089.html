    "question": "I feel like us as zeroses have room to be a little hopeful for this comeback. Our past songs are charting a little bit. We have Kenzie as a producer. Even if it sounds like an EXO reject it’ll still be 100x better than Feel The Pop. Preorders are already doing better than the last comeback. The members themselves like it. The company invested way more into this comeback then previous ones. Like, let’s lift our spirits a little bit? ZB1 is not permanently doomed, and even in the worst case scenario and the comeback isn’t good, they’ll still be one of the most popular 5th Gen groups out there. Don’t feel so doomed y’all. Even if we strive for greatness and fall, we’ll still land on something good. And we could yap until eternity about promotions and unfair opportunities (which WakeOne is being unfair - I’m not discounting that) but at the end of the day our boys will still be more popular than others even if they continue on the way that they have been. There will always be at least some fanbase to support them for the rest of their idol careers. Even Taerae, the member with arguably the smallest fanbase of the group, is still more well known than almost all of EVNNE. Let’s be hopeful guys 😊☺️",
