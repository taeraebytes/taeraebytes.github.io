      <p>I finally realized how to article why Myung Jaehyun rubs people the wrong way. No itâ€™s not his adhd (which is worse than Gyuvinâ€™s by 100x and actually made me realize how lucky we were gyuvinâ€™s been on adderal or whatever and caused him to mellow out a bit). Itâ€™s because heâ€™s such a try hard. Heâ€™s constantly doing things that could go over any normal personâ€™s boundaries, making jokes that for sure make at least someone uncomfortable, always trying to joke or even be the butt of the joke, and always taking the spotlight. He needs SO much attention that sometimes Iâ€™ll be watching bnd content and a diff member will be getting complimented and he interjects to make a joke or say something loudly, redirecting the spotlight back to him even if he was agreeing with the initial compliment to the other member. I donâ€™t think heâ€™s malicious and I can ðŸ’¯ see him regretting his behavior in the future but like please, someone give him a melatonin every morning or put lavender essential oil everywhere he goes to chill him out.</p>

      <p>He's always gave jealous so it's no surprise that all attention must be on him or he'll freak and the way everything he does is for a reaction like buddy do you even know yourself as a person it's so weird to see it's like he was born an annoying celeb persona
