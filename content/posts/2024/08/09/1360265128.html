      <p>Would you prefer to be the whole group or like 1-2 members? Tbh no offense but I've watched the Sunwoo one, the ONF one and the teasers of the one coming with Natty and Julie and imo the less members, the more fun it is. ONF plot was kinda boring.</p>

      <p>it would be so hard to get something interesting with all 9 icl unless they did smth like that one Astro show but yea its prob gonna be like 3-4 members maybe 5 if we can stretch it. Maybe they'd get 2 episodes #mnetprinces 😆
