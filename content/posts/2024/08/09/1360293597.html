      <p>Would you prefer to be the whole group or like 1-2 members? Tbh no offense but I've watched the Sunwoo one, the ONF one and the teasers of the one coming with Natty and Julie and imo the less members, the more fun it is. ONF plot was kinda boring.</p>

      <p>it would be so hard to get something interesting with all 9 icl unless they did smth like that one Astro show but yea its prob gonna be like 3-4 members maybe 5 if we can stretch it. Maybe they'd get 2 episodes #mnetprinces 😆

      <p>i don't think we would get any because mnet exhausted the zb1 appearance fund in aotm and it probably didn't give them returns until now because the video is still disqualified for revenue since allins are still buying illegal views</p>

      <p>I'm not sure what makes yall think zb1s association to mnet is reliant on views and funds and not because.... they literally made the group 😭 it doesn't matter aotm doesn't have a youtube trend policy the views are still there and let's not act like hanbin wasn't the first obvious choice like damn it's not surprising who else was gonna get it. And im sorry are wakeone or mnet in debt their funds are more than fine

      <p>yea they haven't but it doesn't have to do with aotm or funds 😭😭 there's obviously some other issue but yea they seem to be going crazy with the schedules so let's hope and see

      <p>yea they like using them to promote their shit but can't do nothing for them back like the last time they  actually did something for them was in their debut era while they just hand every other group shit</p>

      <p>I genuinely wonder if it’s because they have accepted they ain’t getting zb1 to resign and they have Kepler who just resigned and izna who are permanent. Things have definitely shifted a little since iland 2</p>
