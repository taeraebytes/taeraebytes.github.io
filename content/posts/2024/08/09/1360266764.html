      <p>I‚Äôd laugh my ass off if Jihoon is a better tutter than Hanbin because his fanbase would lose 80% of their identity. ‚ÄúTHE BEST TUTTER EVER!‚Äù ‚Äú#1 MAIN DANCER‚Äù ‚ÄúONLY PROFESSIONAL QUEER STYLE MALE DANCER!!!‚Äù They‚Äôd all cry in unison in some vapid attempt at defensiveness and protection over a man that will never know they exist. I feel like Hanbin has been put on a pedestal and while I do believe he genuinely means a lot for future queer idols and representation, at the end of the day tutting and waacking and ballroom are just some of the many styles of dances in the world. While Hanbin does mean a lot for representation, his speciality doesn‚Äôt inherently have more worth than to say those that specialize in krumping.</p>

      <p>It would be surprising since he's so closely associated with it and given the title but honestly it isn't too crazy to here kpop fans will rlly just hype their idols up to be the best at anything even if they're not. It's just crazy to me how much people have made it an identity marker for him

      <p>This is why gyuvin got that mc gig and not gunwook because y'all want to speak on other members talents and want to speculate (not even saying with proof) how other group idols are better than him just because you don't like him. And I don't even understand this type of obsession and hatred where he didn't even have to do anything but you want to make something he really treasures look normal and uninteresting. At least gunwook said hanbin is really talented and that there is a lot to unpack about his talents. Maybe be nice to good people and hope for good things to happen to gunwook instead. This pissed me off even more because there are actual retarded rosin antis in weibo saying jihoon is better because he looks like a man dancing but hanbin wants to do it like women or something. I hope you know you are entertaining the opinion of homophobic people</p>

      <p>Yeah because undermining Hanbin's skills equals to being nasty to allins. it was never about dancing but about your beef with allins. You can be horrible towards hanbin just because you think we are horrible people and we didn't even say anything about gw now. And I don't care if you keep talking about that few allins you encountered before, we don't talk shit now but you did. You horrible human being. I hope you understand you are a homophobe</p>

      <p>So just bc some homophobe on Weibo talks shit about Hanbin's dance means anyone anywhere else in the world who says that his dancing isnt all that (literally wasnt even said but you clearly interpret anything other than ass-kissing or commentary without fawning qualifiers as that) or that there may be idols who are better than him at his specialty is being homophobic?  What kind of retarded logic is that and wtf does that have to do with gunwook or gyuvin you do realize that when you make two points you're supposed to actually connect them together right, not just stick them next to each other for the vibes? And the fact that you think speculating that someone could be better at something or that an a fan-made identity may be overblown constitutes as horrible hate well guess what if you make someone's whole identity that theyre the first and best at something of course people are gonna challenge that bc there are many talented idols and people in this world not just one. "I hope you understand you are a homophobe" I hope you understand that weaponizing homophobia in an effort to larp as a good and moral person makes you a shitstain and liability to any social movement you hide behind</p>

      <p>Your block ain't working. I also ask normal ccs about the group and you still reply to them. I didn't talk about it anymore because I was sleeping. And you'd rather call anyone a better dancer than acknowledge hanbin. Tbh I don't care but the timing right when weibo peeps were being homophobic, you started it too. And no Hanbin is a better tutter than that jihoon. There is a video of both of them dancing predebut (it is not tutting) but hanbin still did better</p>
