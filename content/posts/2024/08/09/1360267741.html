      <p>Allins: you’re homophobic for criticizing Hanbin or thinking he couldnt possibly be the best dancer ever!!! Anything you say that isn’t worshipping him is homophobic and you are a horrible person!!!!

They wonder why people hate them and why the fandom makes people not like Hanbin. Argue with a wall if you think fandoms don’t influence outside perceptions of idols. And like, do they not remember shotaro exists??? I don’t even like Riize and I genuinely dislike eunseok (don’t get me started on wackass Sungchan) but shotaro could outdance Hanbin in his sleep. Sorry dolls, your vapid one-dimensional hero worship of a man who clearly doesn’t want his queer art background coming to light, is, in fact, not a good thing too. Genuinely hoping now someone with a better tutting, whacking, and ballroom background debuts just so they shut the fawk up. Hanbin isn’t the end-all of talent. People can in fact be better than him and other dance styles in fact deserve respect.</p>

      <p>ngl even if the second coming of michael jackson himself debuted tomorrow they still wouldn't stfu the goalposts would just move. like they can't claim only dancer in kpop to specialize in tutting anymore but i'll bet they'll start pushing his "professional" status even more</p>

      <p>It doesn't matter every kpop fan does that there's no such thing as criticism you will hear people call their biases the best _______ and be dead fucking serious
