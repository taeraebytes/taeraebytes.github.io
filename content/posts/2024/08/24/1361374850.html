      <p>“after gyuvin made a mistake he sank down and the pd was hugging him and his face got red and he was running his hands through his hair”
at what point is he going to accept the fact that maybe this job is just not for him... like imagine if hanbin had to be coddled and babied by the pd like this I can’t even imagine it in my head because the idea of it is so ridiculous</p>
