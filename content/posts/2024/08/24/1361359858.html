      <p>Sorry I’m the one who sent who and what the iamhyunseo person said. They said it was a male idol between 2001-2003 and rookie and an idol in their 4th yeah and they had been dating for 2 years since they were trainees but broke up in December. And that the idol dated at home ? (Didn’t live in dorms or at the women’s house, I’m guessing they just mean they lived alone) anyway again it doesn’t really make sense why people think it was hanbin but again all it takes is one person mentioning a name for people to have it in the back of their head and question it</p>
