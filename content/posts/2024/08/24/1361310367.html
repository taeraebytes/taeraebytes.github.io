      <p>a good half genuinely hates it and the other half just mourns black every other day like they edit him with black hair so much ITS CRAZY ðŸ˜­ and I genuinely love the purple too I would get it if it was still blue I hated it but rn it's so pretty they literally tweak in the gallery everyday begging him to do black for promotions
