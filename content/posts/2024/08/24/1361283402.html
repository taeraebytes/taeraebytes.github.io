      <p>the era of cbar mass buying is over anyways for pretty much all kpop unless it's for solos this has been true since probably late 2023 so all the cbars not opening links is to be expected regardless of treatment ngl</p>

      <p>Didn’t someone send in here how there’s the new shipping regulations to China which have meant cbar numbers overall have gone down alot and now cbars are hiding numbers or not opening likes under the guise of doing it because of treatment but it’s really because they don’t want fans to see the drop in album orders. This is something that’s effected all groups</p>

also baekhyun's solo cbar orders broke 200k albums in one day just a few weeks ago so numbers can still be high, it depends on whether fans are willing to spend for it which is realistically not gonna happen for non-solo orders since solo stanning is so prevalent in china</p>
