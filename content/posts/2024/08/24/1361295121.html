K no but I actually get why his k fans are tweaking, I don't fuck with the trucks but i agree with lines and his korean schedules because it's not like the k gp don't care about him they've shown interest multiple times I always see u guys talking about him going viral on theqoo and now ig reels too but he just doesn't have enough content to solidify that interest like turning them from casuals to fans.
