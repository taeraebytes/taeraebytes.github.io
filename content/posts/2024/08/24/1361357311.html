      <p>damn they sent an entire truck brigade I thought it was only one truck ðŸ˜­ embarrassing yes but lowkey needed because if it was just the truck alone wakeone will just ignore it and not change anything but his kfans were also really verbal (rightfully) and wakeone actually does listen to his kfans so I'm curious what will happen ngl

also do u guys rmb i think it was the jiwoong scandal? someone sent a truck or something and his fan stole the truck dude's phone and went on his kakao talk and got jiwoong in more shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>LIKE THIS IS A LOT but again trucks have no impact I feel like sending a lot applies pressure but... wakeones an immovable force ðŸ˜­ they probably would listen to kfans tweaking on twitter more which yea they stand behind this but it feels like trucks just do nothing but add spite and yes I rmbr that they doxxed the girl that organized it because of that
