      <p>I saw the statement it's just funny like nobody is surprised and nobody cares ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm not sure how u can only focus on his solo activities and completely ignore his career and his main goal like ur not supporting him at all but alright. they said it was a careful decision and it looks like crosins agree sooo that's them ig. it's also just insane how a lot if not most of them are fans because he's the first foreign center in kpop like how does that work but hey they can do them nobody was banking on the support anyways

      <p>i feel like thereâ€™s no logical reality where supporting someoneâ€™s career while ignoring/boycotting his main activities can coexist</p>
