      <p>I saw the statement it's just funny like nobody is surprised and nobody cares ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm not sure how u can only focus on his solo activities and completely ignore his career and his main goal like ur not supporting him at all but alright. they said it was a careful decision and it looks like crosins agree sooo that's them ig. it's also just insane how a lot if not most of them are fans because he's the first foreign center in kpop like how does that work but hey they can do them nobody was banking on the support anyways

      <p>Itâ€™s funny because they are riding so hard on supporting his solo career when a good chunk of them are only here because heâ€™s the first foreign centre ðŸ˜­ like if you actually wanted to support his career why would you ask fans to boycott his work. Half these people wonâ€™t even be supporting him if he actually does go solo. Anyway at least they canâ€™t act like this albums success is due to them since they are publicly boycotting</p>
