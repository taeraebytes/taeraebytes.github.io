      <p>does teddy not produce for babymonster? im wondering why YG would let him debut a new girlgroup so close to babymonster's debut, AND produce for izna on top of that. it's like one person singlehandedly saturating the market theyre all gonna be competing against each other with similar styles and sounds</p>
