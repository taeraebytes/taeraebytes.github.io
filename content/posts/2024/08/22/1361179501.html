      <p>Doubt anyone he will probably go to both. Mca will probably finish around 7:30 and the kwda venue is just up the street and apparently there is no artist seating at kwda so they will all just be in waiting rooms till they perform</p>

      <p>Yeah the venue is Jamsil arena which is literally 12 minutes away by car but tbh it would have been better for him to only attend one rather than both.I can‚Äôt understand why they would double book him like that in such close proximity too when they are probably being run down from cb prep anyway</p>

      <p>They will be back in Seoul after every concert anyway, the flight info got leaked ages ago and most groups do that when they go on Asia tours. Flying back to Korea is way cheaper than staying in a hotel for a week then flying to another country and it makes the visa process a little easier too. Plus then they can use their own practice rooms to practice and change anything to the set lists</p>

      <p>Yeah like flying back from America or Europe wouldn‚Äôt make any sense but since they are just doing Asia paying for a hotel for a week works out way more expensive plus they‚Äôd have to rent space to rehearse and shit which again doesn‚Äôt really make sense to do unless they were really far like America or Europe.</p>
