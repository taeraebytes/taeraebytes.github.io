      <p>almost shed a tear but I think the part we heard in the sampler was the last chorus for good so bad I love it 

I'm curious ab insomnia too but that snippet enough was to become my favorite I LOVE ITTTTTT 

I feel like I didn't hear enough of road movie to rlly say i like it it's not bad tho 

Hearing it in Korean was funny im just so used to the Japanese but it didn't sound weird that's good 

It's a ballad I guess but so much better than the typical kind it's cute 

I actually think I'm gonna like it sm more when we hear the full thing 

AAAAAAND MID AS FUCK ðŸ˜’ I know I'll end up liking it since it's a snippet and probably the worst part cuz it's jiwoong but icb I claimed this
