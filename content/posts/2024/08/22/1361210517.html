      <p>The 30 sec snippet is already pretty good and theyre def gatekeeping the best parts (obviously) for the full song so I'm not worried but what I am worried about is a shitty choreo ðŸ˜­ 

Choreo is so important and can bring more hype to the song so please wedemboyz u got 3 comebacks experience pls do something and better yet hope wakeone get multiple choreographers this time</p>
