      <p>the choreo isn't ugly but they're obviously not dancing the actual full choreo or going full energy

      <p>i know it's gonna sound a mess live bc they said it has a lot of high parts/falsettos and hanbin sounded like he was out of breath trying to sing that line so like... why keep giving them songs not in their vocal ranges when everyone praised them for the run run cover?</p>

      <p>it didn't sound bad but obviously he doesn't sound the most comfortable and it's very breathy/not clean i just don't understand the thought process behind these things</p>
