      <p>I saw the statement it's just funny like nobody is surprised and nobody cares üò≠üò≠üò≠ I'm not sure how u can only focus on his solo activities and completely ignore his career and his main goal like ur not supporting him at all but alright. they said it was a careful decision and it looks like crosins agree sooo that's them ig. it's also just insane how a lot if not most of them are fans because he's the first foreign center in kpop like how does that work but hey they can do them nobody was banking on the support anyways

      <p>It‚Äôs funny because they are riding so hard on supporting his solo career when a good chunk of them are only here because he‚Äôs the first foreign centre üò≠ like if you actually wanted to support his career why would you ask fans to boycott his work. Half these people won‚Äôt even be supporting him if he actually does go solo. Anyway at least they can‚Äôt act like this albums success is due to them since they are publicly boycotting</p>

      <p>first and foremost I'm not reading 3 paragraphs ZHBAR is putting out üòÇ‚úåÔ∏è and we know it's not a boycott specifically like puhlease nobody not even rosins would ever do it even if they enacted a statement explicitly stating so. there's no intention of supporting hao in group activities which can be interpreted as such if you want like it's an attempt won't make much of a difference but it's the intention ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è AND WERE WAITING ON THE STATEMENT TOO YEZGAWDDD TELL HA WE NEED IT ON A PLATTER yall are so funny when u guys act like that's not where they want it to go we'll be getting the full statement soon
