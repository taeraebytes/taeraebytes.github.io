      <p>I don't even think that their own fans know that much. But from what I know:

-Hui went to BP, the members were upset so they unfollowed him and from what I understood Hui did tell them beforehand but they didn't want him to do it, but he was like nah I gotta do this and they were like well ok but we don't agree.

-Then some members got over it and said that fans should support him on their lives.

-BP ends, pentagon disbands, only a few stay in the company but Yuto goes to Japan and unfollows them all 

-Hongseok goes live and talks about how it was not only a follow but that he blocked them too and he doesn't understand why. And from what I understand he's not angry at him, he actually wants to know why he blocked them and be friends again.

-until this day Yuto still has them blocked, other members interact just fine and they seem to be fine with Hui too. And Yuto is still friends with other japanese idols like Twice Misamo and NCT Yuta</p>
