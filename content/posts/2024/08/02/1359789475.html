      <p>Ugh I hope someone asks him again in fs so he knows the demand is here🙏🙏🙏 seriously I don't want to make it seem like I'm above other fans (I am) but i can't believe no one asked anything about producing and lyrics writing to the members like that's something they've mentioned several times I wanna know if they have some projects, especially Gunwook since I'm really curious about what his beat selection is gonna be</p>

      <p>Taerae, Gunwook and Hanbin have written before right 
Matthew wrote the little intro on the trailer which isn't a song but it's still interesting 
Shimkongz have composed and written a song yes it was mid but the desire was there
I think Hao mentioned he wanted to be a producer? And said he wanted to compose a few times 

That's literally all members besides Yujin and Jiwoong like I doubt they'll have the time but there does seem to be a wish to be more creatively involved it kills me that no one asks them about this💔</p>

      <p>yea that's about right most of them wanna try immersing themselves it's surprising no one asks like I get the first timer fancall/fansign fans getting their moments but to the people who enter every day please switch it up
