 The quotes on this tweetðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Didn't I tell you allins like gunwook now. And it is not because of just him praising hb because if hao did the same, no one will be moved</p>

      <p>I just saw 3 people in the quotes who used to bully gunwook severely ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.. I'm over it now but some of those people in the quotes dead used to attack his character and spread rumors mi cyant forgive that the others are fine but it's definitely cuz gpds are doormats and gunwooks praising hanbin lol
