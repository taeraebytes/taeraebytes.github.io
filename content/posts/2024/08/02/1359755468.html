      <p>that's the thing about nose jobs tho its never a one time surgery you always have to get it revised every few years and if ur lucky every decade and even if there's nothing wrong body dysmorphia is a huge thing and trends are a huge thing, one type of nose might be trendy but then may be ugly in a few years so then you get the new trendy nose</p>

      <p>yeaaa it doesn't stop with the first surgery unfortunately in Eric's case he had a more subtle nose with his first round of work it was supposed to suit how his nose naturally was but after the second time I could tell where it was going and he's probably gonna have to get this revised in a few yrs it's a shame it's actually terrible....

      <p>I didnt get my nose done but I accompanied my friend to do window shopping at plastic surgeons in Seoul. Now what i didnt realise until I went to a couple of clinics there is that there is rlly no such thing as a one-off surgery, most of the times there is a plan for you to return and get an upgrade, the more expensive places also give you +1s to also get other parts of your face done. I mean imagine I was just sitting there and the receptionist pointed at me to say are you sure you dont need your lips filled, i’ll give it to you as a SERVICE (like what you call a free add-on over there). like girl fawk u (i ended up getting them done)</p>
