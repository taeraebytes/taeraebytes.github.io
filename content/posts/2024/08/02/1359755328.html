      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>
