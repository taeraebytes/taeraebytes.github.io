      <p>sometimes its upsetting to see zeroses interact with allin akgaes that used to be so openly vile to the members even following them like did we all just collectively forget about it 😭 but i noticed theres so many new zeroses that might know so whatever i know it shouldnt be a big deal i just have trauma seeing those accs lol</p>

      <p>I stanned after sweat 😭 and the fandom seemed relatively calm to me aside from a few pockets of tweakers so idk most the history behind ’known’ akgaes</p>

      <p>I saw a discussion on rps twt where someone was like you guys cannot compare all the members in certain subjects cause some members actually had to suffer from very real invasion of privacy and vile homophobia and the replies were like who, jiwoong?? That's how I knew some people were new new</p>

      <p>a few days ago i saw someone unironically say that the bulk of jiwoong's hate comes from him being in a BL or two like are these ppl just obtuse on purpose 😭 omg during in bloom era when apparently it was speculated on the k-side that he had a gf and his own apartment and wasn't getting cheers during music shows due to that and woongdeongies were like "it's bc he played gay roles in dramas!!!!!!!"</p>

      <p>YES I RMBR he lost half his fans during in bloom and ppl thought it was cuz of the bls 😭.. they're so dumb they wouldn't have been there in the first place but it's crazy the gf and apartment was his first hit AND HE STILL DIDNT MOVE IN WITH THEM 😭😭😭😭😭
