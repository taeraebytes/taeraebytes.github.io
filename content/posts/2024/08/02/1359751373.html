      <p>We know that Wakeone and YGE are unserious companies, hybe will beg anything just so they can give Katseye some schedule, sunmi and bambam company are into that crypto shit, but how does SM see all this crap and yet they are fine with aespa going there and being on the two days after the latest concert failed ðŸ˜­</p>
