      <p>well iâ€™m not a chinese fangirl anon and heâ€™s a kpop idol and not purely a chinese celeb, iâ€™m not against him doing stuff in china or anything and itâ€™s great that he has those opportunities, but iâ€™m honestly tired of how much we are influenced by his cfans and it seems like even his agency thinks only they matter</p>
