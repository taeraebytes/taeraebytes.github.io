      <p>aww seeing briizes converting here is cute af ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but as a multistan who has briize moots they're not all insufferable the insufferable ones are the sm stans and ex boysplanet watchers who are STILL holding onto a grudge for their 1pick not debuting like I'm pretty sure some @'s are already poppin up because they always in our shit on twt and the funniest thing is most zeroses have these insufferable losers who dont got nothing going on in real life blocked but they make burners so they can see our stuff and what were up to and camp all our shit to qrt something hateful like its so pathetic and theyre 16 or something like they really be spending their precious youth camping a group they do not like to qrt what probably is their insecurities for some likes which is just so cringe</p>
