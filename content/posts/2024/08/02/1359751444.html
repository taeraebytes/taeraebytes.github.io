      <p>that's the thing about nose jobs tho its never a one time surgery you always have to get it revised every few years and if ur lucky every decade and even if there's nothing wrong body dysmorphia is a huge thing and trends are a huge thing, one type of nose might be trendy but then may be ugly in a few years so then you get the new trendy nose</p>

      <p>yeaaa it doesn't stop with the first surgery unfortunately in Eric's case he had a more subtle nose with his first round of work it was supposed to suit how his nose naturally was but after the second time I could tell where it was going and he's probably gonna have to get this revised in a few yrs it's a shame it's actually terrible....
