      <p>I just saw 3 people in the quotes who used to bully gunwook severely 😭😭.. I'm over it now but some of those people in the quotes dead used to attack his character and spread rumors mi cyant forgive that the others are fine but it's definitely cuz gpds are doormats and gunwooks praising hanbin lol
