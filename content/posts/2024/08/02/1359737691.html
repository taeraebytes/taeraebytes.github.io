      <p>I saw another briize anon confess they were a briize a day ago and I'd like to confess too that I am also a briize and I have been lurking your cc and this if my first ask on your cc. Idk if you rmb me but I was that one anon that asked lotus if it's worth getting into zb1 a couple weeks ago and funny enough u replied fuck no ðŸ˜­ 

But I was so bored so I watched kstarnextdoor that night and felt guilty for laughing as much as I did and then I watched Idol theatre and now I'm watching all their ZBTV ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>OH SIS THANK GODDD because going through his scandal was the worst ruvking thing ever honestly his was worse than seunghans it took what 3? Hours and he almost had 70k+ quotes and made it to the news.... and everything after made it so much worse so while riize handled it swiftly and kicked seunghan and gained popularity jiwoong made it worse and he's still in zb1 ðŸ˜‘.... the effects will follow the group forever
