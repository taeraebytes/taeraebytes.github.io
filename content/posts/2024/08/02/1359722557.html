      <p>its crazy how there are yuehuaz fans in all fandom spaces (c, kr, jpn and intl). having four members from yuehua really makes these people think that they will all redebut together</p>

      <p>I think the really funny thing would be all 4 leaving since yuehua artists famously ALL leave lmao but actually I predict gyuvin leaving like him doing all that cinema for the just for in the end leave straight away would be soo gyuvin of him</p>

      <p>Idk I'm too convinced like he's so full throttle from mentioning them in his bp speech to mentioning it in a fansign he seems sold but I can see him just deciding one day to go

      <p>Thing w gyuvin is he gets so fixated on stuff but can only be obsessed w one thing at a time so like if another company offers him a contract and he meets one of the trainees and vibes w him hes gonna switch off IMMEDIATELY ðŸ˜­or imagine he gets a girl he's gonna consider her first in every one of his choices</p>
