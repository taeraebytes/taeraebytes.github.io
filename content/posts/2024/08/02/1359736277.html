      <p>I saw another briize anon confess they were a briize a day ago and I'd like to confess too that I am also a briize and I have been lurking your cc and this if my first ask on your cc. Idk if you rmb me but I was that one anon that asked lotus if it's worth getting into zb1 a couple weeks ago and funny enough u replied fuck no ðŸ˜­ 

But I was so bored so I watched kstarnextdoor that night and felt guilty for laughing as much as I did and then I watched Idol theatre and now I'm watching all their ZBTV ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Icl I really like their humor style and just over all vibe with each other but I think imma keep with my original plan and just stay off stan twt. There are just a bunch of insufferable trolls esp briizes that don't like zb1 and I don't want them to ruin my enjoyment so I'll stick to here for my zb1 fix I hope you don't mind lurkers ðŸ˜£ I just feel like I'm so new to the fandom I don't really have any opinions yet but I really like them all and have a bias line already LOL</p>
