      <p>i saw someone calling koreans superstitionus and remember something from that weibo melon account, i don't think it is true but apparently one night hanbin saw someone in the dorm but that member was not there that night and the comments were talking about how the next comeback is going to be huge since they associate seeing something paranormal with success.</p>

      <p>Hanbin did say it. It looked like he was also hoping for them to do well after saying that ghost thing. But I don't remember if it was before ftp because if it is then it makes no sense</p>

      <p>No actually he was being hopeful. The whole group was begging for success during ftp and sweat. They really wanted to do well. He said about the ghost story because of that superstition not because he saw ghost and got scared or something.</p>

      <p>tbh i cant blame them for being so desperate and begging and praying every chance they got. crush was 50/50 split so they probably really wanted a good tt all fans will like and when they were prob in the brainstorming room with producers choosing their title track aka ftp vs sweat, obv sweat was the right answer but producers really wanted ftp cause they wanna reach the western audience with fuckass max but the members were prob like wtf is this weak ass shit?????!?!! 

So probably since Jan or Feb when they already decided on ftp the members were skeptical af and didn't even believe in ftp, they were prob hoping its gonna be a momoland boom boom typa song where they hated it but blew up. And then the infamous jiwoong scandal happened which was early/ end of feb I forgot but that was literally a sign from the juju gods that yhmah was gonna be fcked. I never seen the members so doubtful and depressed in my life during comeback prep for yhmah because they knew they were practicing for a shit tt and they lost the gp even before comeback AND the fact that they can;t even redeem themselves with a good tt because they know ftp is shit. 

ugh, w.e I feel like thats the lowest we gonna go like mhj lowkey casted some spells on us but it's different now, the air is cleaner and skies are brighter</p>

      <p>like this cb was just a culmination of everything bad I turned off their showcase because they were that fucking depressing them pushing for sweat to be a prerelease and it tanking made it so much worse it felt like all hope was lost but I rlly don't see how it could get any worse than that so we'll be good now
