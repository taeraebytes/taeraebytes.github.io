      <p>I saw another briize anon confess they were a briize a day ago and I'd like to confess too that I am also a briize and I have been lurking your cc and this if my first ask on your cc. Idk if you rmb me but I was that one anon that asked lotus if it's worth getting into zb1 a couple weeks ago and funny enough u replied fuck no üò≠ 

But I was so bored so I watched kstarnextdoor that night and felt guilty for laughing as much as I did and then I watched Idol theatre and now I'm watching all their ZBTV üò≠</p>

      <p>Icl I really like their humor style and just over all vibe with each other but I think imma keep with my original plan and just stay off stan twt. There are just a bunch of insufferable trolls esp briizes that don't like zb1 and I don't want them to ruin my enjoyment so I'll stick to here for my zb1 fix I hope you don't mind lurkers üò£ I just feel like I'm so new to the fandom I don't really have any opinions yet but I really like them all and have a bias line already LOL</p>

      <p>for anyone that isnt on twt like me i recommend u join the discord (zerobaseone) you get the sns updates, plus chat updates, theres always discussions going on and they usually live stream events. i used to be someone that thought u cant stan without a stan twt acc but actually after just become a fulltime discord and youtube stan i loved zb1 wayyyy more esp after slowly losing interest</p>
