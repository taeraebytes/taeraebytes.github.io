      <p>i have to say im not part of the akgae crowd but while getting brand deals is great heâ€™s always been very clear in saying his passion lies with music and performing and these brand deals are literally just a way to grab cash from the fans since these brands know his fans have a massing buying power for their size and and in turn they create some sm clout for him, like itâ€™s cool that he has those but it would be nice to see him get an opportunity to do something heâ€™s actually passionate about?  like ok cute i can buy a brush with his name on it but i like him for singing and performing so idrc about the brush or a mist or whatever they want to sell with his face on the ad, so im not sure why it would calm down the akgaes who i think also want the same things for him (tbh nothing would calm them down, itâ€™s the point of being an akgae)</p>

      <p>I take anything as an opportunity and these things do allow for exposure besides the fan purchase power there's still a benefit to him but it's also not like he's the only one missing out from having activities in what he likes to do

      <p>i shouldâ€™ve clarified that i wasnâ€™t talking comparison with other members because he obviously gets more than most of them, but rather seeing all of the stuff he gets it looks like yh is preparing to make him a variety celeb in china which clearly isnâ€™t what heâ€™s most passionate about and what i want to see from him so rather than just being happy for the opportunities he gets i end up also feeling sad about whatâ€™s about to come after zb1 disbands :(</p>

      <p>yea I thought maybe they were beginning to consider actually making a group with the yuehuaz but it still seems like they're gunning for his push in China

      <p>it seems like such a stupid move to me cuz a big part of crosins pride and motivation is making him the top foreign kidol he would do best with a yuqi type situation but if he goes to china full time as a c list variety star a lot of ppl will end up leaving</p>
