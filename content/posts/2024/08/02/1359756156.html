      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>Okay ðŸ˜­ðŸ‘Œ 

So her vocals did not improve at all since she was an idol in Japan when she was really young and **** TW ED + ASSUMPTIONS ONLY NOT FACTS so don't jump me or queef ****  and Japanese idols are notoriously strict with weight, so there's a chance she was a purger. 

Purging can really mess up your esophagus, throat and mouth especially if you frequently do it because you're not only purging your food but also stomach acids meant to digest food.
