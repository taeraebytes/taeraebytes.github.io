      <p>i saw someone calling koreans superstitionus and remember something from that weibo melon account, i don't think it is true but apparently one night hanbin saw someone in the dorm but that member was not there that night and the comments were talking about how the next comeback is going to be huge since they associate seeing something paranormal with success.</p>

      <p>Hanbin did say it. It looked like he was also hoping for them to do well after saying that ghost thing. But I don't remember if it was before ftp because if it is then it makes no sense</p>

      <p>No actually he was being hopeful. The whole group was begging for success during ftp and sweat. They really wanted to do well. He said about the ghost story because of that superstition not because he saw ghost and got scared or something.</p>

      <p>When hao was like 'show me ideas to promote this song' 💔 it broke me :( I felt so sorry for the boys cuz intl fans can do nothing for kor charts. in the latest busan ep, they were wishing for the album to hit big and to have a peace of mind, good health and happiness. 

Buttttt right now as we noticed the boys all seem very calm compared to the prev era. . Hao in their recent anniversary video said something like 'they were many disappointments but we gained more than we lost, zeroses support us a lot and that's more than enough for us' I think they made peace with how they stand as a group in terms of everything. ugh I wish nothing but happiness and success T_T</p>
