      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>Imo it goes from idol to idol too. Imo Chaewon sounds better now and it's a way better performer than she was in Izone on where she was already outstanding ngl but she's way better now.

As for Yunjin, I honestly feel like we don't really know what happened there, all her videos of her doing musicals and singing it's her trying to imitate an opera technique that doesn't do anything for her vocally on pop songs lol, and her time during produce was good but we know that mnet shows have insane vocal editing so.</p>
