      <p>I feel like they would send some ateez members so they do archery, same with jype they will probably send Ryujin/Yuna/Yeji to the archery competition so they can do some articles about itzy visuals and hype up their comeback a little and if itzy really is in the gutter right now I could see them sending Charyeong for dance sports, and Enhypen for archery too lol.</p>

      <p>I was thinking about this... If they send Hanbin tbh the other choreos for male idols during dance sports were not hard at all plus Hanbin did a little bit of ballroom before so he could actually get a choreo learned and perfected in like 1.5-2 weeks. Dance sports during ISAC was harder for the ladies bc they had to dance in heels + pair dancing in ballroom is always harder for the women part.</p>

      <p>1.5-2 weeks sis filming is in 3 days ITS OVER üò≠ plus ballroom requires a female partner which will definitely not go
