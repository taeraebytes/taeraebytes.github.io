      <p>People are mad like I’m seeing loads of ot9 pissed at wakeone because the comeback is the 26th they will promote for 2/3 weeks straight and go fly to La for 2 days in the middle of that, miss chuseok and then only have 2 days rest (if they aren’t promoting for the 3rd week) before the tour kicks off</p>

      <p>mmmm I feel like sweat and ftp should've been a lesson for us I realized I can't care about stats if I want to enjoy them were on limited time so these things don't even matter. I'm happy that the quality is much better already but I'm just happy that they're promoting and we're getting content like if it does the same as ftp I won't be upset .I can't lie and say I won't be disappointed but in the end I'm still sticking around and if they can be happy about it it's aight

      <p>for music show's award i think they will be ok since no big group comeback around that date. but for melon chart it depends on cj payola, eventho kzerose seemed interest with this cb it's not enough, but we need gp interest. only cj can sneak the song on chart and keep it for several days thus gp will take a look. that's the only way.</p>
