      <p>who is 아이엠현서 i saw a kzerose tiktok and the comments were full of that name apparently they kick started the hanbin dating rumors but kfans were being hushed about it and even said don’t bring the issue to tiktok but then hanbin clarified about it so i guess the messages he received were rly mostly about dating rumors?</p>

      <p>oh that dude was the youtuber that received an anonymous 'tip'? or something asking for advice and the anon was saying 'i dated an idol, broke up cause company found out but stayed friends, still had feelings and wanted to get back together but he still said no and something bout his member hitting on her' and it caused a whole commotion because everyone was guessing who this idol was

apparently its 'legit' because this anon showed picture proof and audio but it could also be this youtuber talking out his ass to get views</p>
