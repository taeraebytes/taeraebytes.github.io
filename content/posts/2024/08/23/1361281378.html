      <p>The way they are blaming the mixing and auto tune like heâ€™s not even my bias and I can still pick his voice out clearly like they just want him to have no parts atp so they can complain ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>They could use Hanbin, Taerae and Gunwook voices mix it with 1000 layers of auto tune and it wouldn't sound like this, it's obviously Hao but they are stupid. Then there's some hoe saying that he got a random part and they are not getting intro, chorus or outro Hao as if this isn't probably the intro of the song like shut up.</p>
