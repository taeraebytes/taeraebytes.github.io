      <p>k I know we always say this but there's got to be some truth to it because how boring is riize that theyre stans are always in our shit watching our content? If you don't like us and left us for a new group why keep looking back? It's like u break up, found a new partner but always keeping tabs on ur ex and what ur ex is up to üò≠ now that's cringe. Like we never ever talk about riize content because we dont watch their shit and dgaf about them and only talk about them when they have a scandal cause thats gossip just like any other group.</p>

      <p>LMAOO this gf analogy makes so much sense actually and inspired me so I'm gonna go schizo a bit don't mind me 

Basically we're like the fun, future uncertain international student and rice is the grew up all my life in SM town, parents are well known in the community, wealth inherited, future career secured from parents type of girl so even though we had a good fun time and good chemistry they/ ex zeroses ultimately chose stability. At first the new gf was nice but with time things got boring because this relationship was always about stability and status and not about feelings and connections but it's too late to back off now cause the entire town knows they're dating and they are too much of a coward to admit they made the wrong choice so they stayed with the gf / rice and got married.

But because their now wife/ rice is the one that is relevant in town and they're the one making bread, these briizes are left alone in their big mansion. Lonely. So all they do is watch tmz, scroll tiktok and go on IG but they can't help but look us up and see what were up to. Yeah we might not be living in a mansion and our career is stable but not 100k a year type of salary but were having a lot of fun with friends, enjoying the moment and when we post an IG story they/ briizes are always the first one to watch it and if it's funny they'll giggle underneath their breath but quickly scoffs then say 'pssshhh how pathetic' and roll their eyes but yet they do this every time we post something or are tagged on instagram.
