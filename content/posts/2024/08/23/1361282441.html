      <p>Diff anon but if his cfans sent that truck back in Feb/ March then I'd understand but now? wtf? The past two months he's looked the best he ever has especially the past week with his hair down, minimal makeup and body physique. Unless they mean styling as the sleeveless? I kinda get that but istg if he goes back to twink I might just go on weibo and fight those bitches because right now even though he aint my bias he's probably my favourite Kpop visual</p>

      <p>it was explained but it seems like the makeup and the backlash he faced for running man but that wouldn't have anything to do with his promotions unless he was frequently promoting in China but idk
