      <p>i read the translations they don’t mention his clothes they wrote “is this professional hair and makeup? ricky doing it himself is better than this. Immediately improve your poor skills!” from what ive seen cfans in general hate when a lot of hairspray or that wet look is given to hair ive seen it in every fandom ive been in they think it looks greasy and idk what issue theyve had with makeup recently cuz its been looking better</p>

      <p>I consider styling generally so I mean makeup clothes all of it. but it's actually about the makeup?? I thought it would be the sleeveless issue which would make sense since a lottt of other fans hate it for other members and Ricky definitely gets it the most. but that's ....interesting the wet look isn't too bad but genuinely Ricky has looked better now than he did months ago they rlly want him to start looking a mess again yuck

      <p>i thought abt it more and im thinking they might still be upset abt the makeup he had for keep running and some other schedules cuz big cent accounts were dragging him for heavy makeup a lot of his fans do prefer more natural makeup in certain contexts and also balloon helped them write the statements for the trucks so i guess it somewhat reflects kfan opinion too</p>

      <p>I can agree on that they put Ricky in the heaviest makeup out of the group and I've always loved the lighter look on him but a truck 😅😅😅😅 but if balloons in on it I guess kfans agree on something maybe it's the line thing maybe it's the sleeveless styling ik they hate that too
