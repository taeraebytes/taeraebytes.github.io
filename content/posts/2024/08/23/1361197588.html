      <p>now i can justify my dislike for lara, i like her voice but something about her is off. there was a tiktok of her in my fyp and the first thing that comes to mind is that she looks like an influencer not an idol, no wonder nowadays the quality of idols or actors or actresses has downgraded but manon really has star quality </p>
