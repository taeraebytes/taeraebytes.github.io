      <p>who is 아이엠현서 i saw a kzerose tiktok and the comments were full of that name apparently they kick started the hanbin dating rumors but kfans were being hushed about it and even said don’t bring the issue to tiktok but then hanbin clarified about it so i guess the messages he received were rly mostly about dating rumors?</p>
