      <p>Rosins gotta be grovelling for a fight these days I wouldnâ€™t care but the illiteracy kills me because how are you going to shade a fanbase for raising money to buy more copies of the album to help they boys on music shows and claim they did something wrong by ordering hanbinâ€™s digipack only when thatâ€™s exactly what they advertised on the post ðŸ˜­ I donâ€™t even speak Japanese but I can see the words digipack right there and itâ€™s a hanbin fanbase like whose digipack did you think they meant</p>
