      <p>k I know we always say this but there's got to be some truth to it because how boring is riize that theyre stans are always in our shit watching our content? If you don't like us and left us for a new group why keep looking back? It's like u break up, found a new partner but always keeping tabs on ur ex and what ur ex is up to 😭 now that's cringe. Like we never ever talk about riize content because we dont watch their shit and dgaf about them and only talk about them when they have a scandal cause thats gossip just like any other group.</p>

      <p>they def pocket watch there's no doubt about it because they always all up in our qrts whether its official accs or stan accs, even korean accs like damnn you guys are that desperate for content?😭😭 they're also the ones always camping pannchoa, youtube music, boygroupcharts etc to rage bait and are behind set up accs like no other group stans does this, at least to this extent except for briizes and it's actually so sad</p>
