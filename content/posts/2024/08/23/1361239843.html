      <p>I saw the statement it's just funny like nobody is surprised and nobody cares üò≠üò≠üò≠ I'm not sure how u can only focus on his solo activities and completely ignore his career and his main goal like ur not supporting him at all but alright. they said it was a careful decision and it looks like crosins agree sooo that's them ig. it's also just insane how a lot if not most of them are fans because he's the first foreign center in kpop like how does that work but hey they can do them nobody was banking on the support anyways

      <p>It‚Äôs funny because they are riding so hard on supporting his solo career when a good chunk of them are only here because he‚Äôs the first foreign centre üò≠ like if you actually wanted to support his career why would you ask fans to boycott his work. Half these people won‚Äôt even be supporting him if he actually does go solo. Anyway at least they can‚Äôt act like this albums success is due to them since they are publicly boycotting</p>

      <p>first and foremost I'm not reading 3 paragraphs ZHBAR is putting out üòÇ‚úåÔ∏è and we know it's not a boycott specifically like puhlease nobody not even rosins would ever do it even if they enacted a statement explicitly stating so. there's no intention of supporting hao in group activities which can be interpreted as such if you want like it's an attempt won't make much of a difference but it's the intention ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è AND WERE WAITING ON THE STATEMENT TOO YEZGAWDDD TELL HA WE NEED IT ON A PLATTER yall are so funny when u guys act like that's not where they want it to go we'll be getting the full statement soon

      <p>Anon openly telling your fanbase that you won‚Äôt be supporting a member in any group activities when 90% of the activities he does will be group ones ‚Ä¶ BECAUSE HES IN A GROUP sounds a little boycott like to me</p>

      <p>it's an attempt likeeeee what's the point of stating you won't support hao in a group that's support withdrawal what's the difference between a boycott announcement and that üò≠.... but they can statement themselves to death support withdrawal and boycotts would never actually happen we'll continue how we've been lmaoooooo funny tho

      <p>Ok I already said that im aware its not boycott statement and I never called it that myself. I just dont think its bizarre if people do obviously its going to be interpreted that way to a good chunk it doesnt matter to me just cuz theres no difference between this statement and the last we move. And what crosins do and what the bar announces dont have to align just like last time when this statement was released I knew they were just officially withdrawing support by not opening links but fans could do their own thing which theyve done and will continue to do. Even if there was a boycott announcement there would be no total effort. The timing and reiteration of support withdrawal was odd but like I said they can do them. Im not even sure why rosin akgaes are upset people call this a boycott like that isnt what they wish for üò≠ im not saying you are and people can take issue with the interpretation but theres obviously a subset that have a problem weirdly enough. But my point still stands I think the second announcement of support withdrawal was a choice. Im making this long to get every point out and I dont have any intention to keep this going because like always theres never middle ground its just two extremes my inbox is mad annoying right now
