      <p>did they? what did they say because I'm also seeing rukidans go ballistic on the tl because they thought ricky didn't have any lines in the album sampler when it's just them not knowing how to distinguish his voice</p>

      <p>no for the album sample they know ktr are his lines but hate how the only lines w1 shared for the album sampler were heavily edited/ robotic so u can't even tell it's him if u weren't a fan cuz his vocal tone is unique yet they took that away so it sounds like he got 'no' lines to non fans</p>

      <p>they just made that up... JENNFNFMFMMCMFKF it was definitely how he was projecting his voice more than the editing yes he has a pretty tone but he's not gonna sing in the same style for every song plus being a non fan means u don't know the group idk that is crazy saying it's basically no lines ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
