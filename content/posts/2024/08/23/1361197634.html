      <p>I think there was some resentment and people who have never been in a competitive industry don't get it. You are practicing everyday and attending every practice/class and then you see other people not attending and idk you just start disliking those kind of ppl. You start thinking that it's unfair and although you should only take it as an opportunity to be like omg I am just improving while others are missing out, your brain takes things differently and instead you start resenting people who are not putting the same effort as you.</p>
