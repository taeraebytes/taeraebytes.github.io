    "reply": "I think the mv might be longer than just the song but obviously under 5 minutes. The actors gonna be there still and I think good so bad is gonna be about taking their fate into their own hands the song just emits so much hope? There was an anon that said it could be a take on their career ending but they want to continue on but it feels like creating a fresh start the members resonate with the song like listening to the sample over and over again it just feels like a shot of hopium so to me I feel (besides the romance bit where they all have love story's) it's about new beginnings. And the mv would be act heavy idk where I could fit the sf concept in it tho this made zero sense but like idk what else to say cuz im guessing"
