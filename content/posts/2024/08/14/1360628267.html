    "question": "The Gunwook hate is 80% based on his looks, 15% based on the impression from the first few episodes of BP, 5% crazy akgaes (if we are ignoring other fandoms doing their typical trolling).

The sheer magnitude that haters hate on him because he’s not some skinny twink or has a super small v-line face is insane. It’s even crazier cuz dude is not even built, he’s pretty thin compared to literally most people anywhere else in the world. And he’s not ugly at all. They honestly drag him on the very few occasions when he doesn’t sing the best because they can’t drag his background because he was such a good kid growing up and hardworking and people love him. So what else can people who hate him do? Attack his looks that don’t 100% align with fake ass Korean beauty standards and make his small mistakes overblown. Obviously hate is never nice, and it sucks that most hating comments are calling him a fat, ugly pig or an incel (which is a crazy ass insult on so many levels, especially considering it’s Gunwook we’re talking about, an anti-bullying advocate who was part of an all-girl dance club of all people), but I genuinely have hope he’ll realize that the people saying that are insecure and that he isn’t fat or ugly at all. He’s never been the most confident regarding his looks (remember when he’d joke constantly about how he isn’t happy about his looks and make negative comments during debut era?) but I think he’s been gaining confidence recently. I also think him and Matthew getting closer can help because Matthew very much grew up in western culture and has a very idgaf attitude at criticism he doesn’t see as valid, plus he’s never made a negative comment about someone’s weight, is always trying to make Gunwook eat and telling him he’s pretty or handsome. The hate is 100% unfair but I hope it lessens your worries a little bit that he has a good support system, is loved by his members, is very intelligent so hopefully realizes that most hate is bullshit, and that he’s been more confidence recently. Gunwook karma will happen queef, rest assured.",
