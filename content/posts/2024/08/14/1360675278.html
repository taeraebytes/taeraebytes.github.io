      <p>sorry for the rant i just want to get this off my chest but being a ricky stan is seriously so poverty because we all live off fansite pictures and pluschat messages and posts from months ago or from last year because he's never active ik this is so random but i just get this realization every month and im like why am i still here there's really nothing going on for him ever but i just truly vibe with the group a lot and I like him a lot too to just up and leave him and act like he doesn't exist to me but damn ts depressing AF like I used to be a firm believer that wakeone was restricting him from interacting with his fans and posting but even jiwoong interacts after that whole disappearance he had for a few months which i only knew about bc his fans were spamming tf out of their comments about it and now I'm just like damn i guess ricky truly doesn't want or have anything to post or say at all like idk it just racks my brain a lot because he used to be pretty active here and there especially on their twitter account but it just all stopped around november a few weeks after the manager thing and its so weird to me but whatever at the end of the day I'm never leaving no matter what lmaoooo but anyways on a happier note lately I've been gunwook biased a lot like he's seriously so cute, witty, and talented i used to be all about shimkongz but riwook has tooken that place now 😂❤️ they're so adorable together I need a schedule with both of them like right nowwww</p>

      <p>icl I be feeling bad for yall he doing you like jaehyun I thought he'd have a little more consistency after gyuvin told him to get on bubble but he gave up again 😭😭 he's honestly an interesting dude and I rlly like him too but he's also predictable I feel like he was always gonna be this type but maybe he's just busier rn I feel like everyone's kinda gone inactive for the past few weeks cuz of cb prep maybe yall need more kfans and cfans jumping him and he'll get it together. but he's so hype in other areas yea he just needs to force the socmed aspect ig but yassss gunwooks such a fun guy to follow icl he's been a little inactive too for his standards they're all busy hopefully it picks back up but im dying for a riwook schedule tooooo 😆😆😆😆 I love their dynamic so much like please THIS IS WORTH AN INVESTMENT
