      <p>Hanbin said todays stylist was the one who styled him for the star level test, I‚Äôm not sure if all the trainees had the same stylist or they used their own/ styled themselves but I hope they work with this stylist again because these fits were way to good for a festival</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure they were all styled by different people everyone got smth diff but yea they should def work with these stylists again they finally didn't look a mess. I actually think they don't have a set stylist like they do makeup artists we need a team asap

      <p>I know who your talking about and she doesn‚Äôt work under them but she does work with them a lot like in bp towards the end when they boys would go out in public to see their fan support she did all hanbin‚Äôs styling (I really liked the all denim look she put him in) and she did his styling for his debut congratulatory shoot. I wonder if she was the one who also style them the other day since he said it was the same one who styled him for bp audition and he obviously worked with that stylist a lot back then, in which case pass the number because I liked their fits yesterday</p>

      <p>I mean she doesn't work with them all the time bc their other idol is Wheein although she already left the company but yeah Wheein already had an style going on for her and a lot of the people she worked with were people that worked with her under mamamoo company, but for Hanbin I think that stylist (her name is nayeon) has done all the work with her and I am guessing that she was working with Ravi before bc she worked with him when he was promoting with VIXX.</p>
