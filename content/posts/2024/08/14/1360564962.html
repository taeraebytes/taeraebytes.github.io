      <p>that's a bold faced lie it's about 60 ðŸ˜­ but there's an equal amount of cfans and jfans who got in maybe more but I counted the award list ig they're just used to being the overwhelming majority which I get

      <p>I'm now afraid of the comeback streams. kfans on my tl are so pissed, pointing out that there are only few kzeroses left but wakeone is taking care of foreign fans more than them, in their home country</p>

      <p>lowkey the logic isn't logic-ing bc if there are so few k-zeroses left then it would make sense that more foreign fans would get in to the fansign if there's more of them and a number happen to live in korea (haven't checked all this out but i'm assuming this is referring to an in-person fansign rather than a fancall)??? so why be mad when that's partly their doing and, as you've said, it's likely they weren't applying for the fansign anyway ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>That's the thing.... kzeroses remain the majority of the fandom they haven't left and they won't today lol. it's obvious that a lot of them applied cuz the usual fansites are angry they always get in I get why they're upset. my thing is anons acting like zb1 are over like we've been through much worse and here we are I just feel like the dickriding is too much we gon be aight. And this is 1 of a million domestic fansigns that this has happened they'll live..
