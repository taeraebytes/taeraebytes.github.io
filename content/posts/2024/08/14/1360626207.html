      <p>bc the new wakeonez thing was mainly to shit on hanbin, the other members were just collateral damage to shit on hanbin. and since they can't suddenly say that 2/4 yuehuaz will be under wakeone they can't come up with the new wakeonez thing</p>

      <p>As a person who monitors active rosins, the reason why they don't hate gyuvin the way you wanted them is because he was nice to zhang hao during his covid days, he was the one who mentioned that hao was having a hard time and he was never put in the center position unlike hanbin, yujin and Gunwook. He also actively mentions Yuehua which means that he won't be included in Wakeonez ever</p>
