      <p>My spirit has officially been broken ITS OVER I LOST like I'm sorry the game is too tough and idk if I can do this anymore. cc dead makes it worse but I actually can't sit through gunwook being bullied it's gonna be almost 2 years soon and it persists.. he can't breathe wrong, he can't talk wrong, he can't look at someone wrong cuz he'll get hate even if he's perfect he'll get hate. These trolls are genuinely so nasty I truly believe they wanted to counteract his huge positive reception because they had to dig up a lengthy 8 month old live that was full of covers to pick a bad one. The lengths they go the obsession they have with him.. and it's allowed to happen because what happens every single time? Kzeroses ignore it kgpds ignore it the company ignores it nobody does anything like it's gotten to a point where even I can't take it and I know it's only gonna get worse. I'm already upset but yea me being here is also a mistake because trust and believe i get tortured in my inbox daily so this only makes it worse and it's also ammo like im past crash out idgaf if I sound dramatic I'm on my period and I was already sad I REALLY HOPE THE WORLD JUST ENDS TOMORROW I WANT TO CLOSE MY EYES AND I HOPE ZB1 DISAPPEARS AND CEASES TO EXIST. OPPS KEEP WINNING LETS JUST DIE BRUH ITS OVER WE LOST 😂🙌</p>

      <p>queef take a breath, trolls will always be on idols’ ass, a few qrts of trolls is not going to do any damage especially for this, like gunwook having one off moment is not going to harm him, he has had multiple incredible performances and people with braincells and those that matter are aware or will be aware in the future. as you said this is all because he has been gaining attention, it is always something that happens and it happens to many idols, just like it happens to other zb1 members, take some time off and don’t let this sadden you more than a few hours</p>
