      <p>I'm now afraid of the comeback streams. kfans on my tl are so pissed, pointing out that there are only few kzeroses left but wakeone is taking care of foreign fans more than them, in their home country</p>

      <p>They're talking about fansign. Seriously though, companies should limit the foreigners in korean events.make it 70:30 or 60:40 at most where koreans are still the majority.we still need to take care of the core fanbase in sk</p>

      <p>having a core fandom is super important and we do need the kfans but ur right they're not different from other fans they can complain it doesn't matter I get why they're mad but acting like we must worship them or as if them claiming to withdraw support (mind u only a few and those same people continue to stick around they never leave) does anything we are fine they'll move on theres genuinely worse we've been through we survived jiwoonggate
