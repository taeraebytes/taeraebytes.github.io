      <p>Chanyeol might actually do good - his biggest scandal of cheating on his gf of 3 years died down/was partially disproven so people aren't actively against him anymore. I feel like we should be a little more worried for all of his scores except physical sales. This comeback for Le Sserafim will either ruin them for the rest of their run or be the bounce back of all lifetime so you can't really draw expectations yet. Jaehyun we don't gotta worry about and I refuse to recognize PLAVE</p>

      <p>Baekhyun is having a cb on 6th sep. I think we should be more worried about that than chanyeol. I don't know if Baekhyun is still popular but he is definitely more popular than chanyeol.</p>

      <p>Chanyeol is also having his solo on Baekhyun's cb date. So there is no need for anyone to be worried about that guy. I find it weird though, they suddenly changed the date to be same as Baekhyun's cb and then chanyeol archieved posts with Baekhyun on his Instagram yesterday. I don't know what is wrong but I'm on Baekhyun's side.</p>
