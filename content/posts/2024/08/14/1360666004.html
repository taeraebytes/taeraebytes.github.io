      <p>Since the Suga DUI brought out insane fans I wanted to ask y’all: what would you do if your fave did the same thing? Personally I’d cry because I’d expect better and then burn all their photo cards and make a donation in their name to a cult so they’d get constant mails or messages asking for more. Then I’d become a certified hater and troll them out of anger of disappointment. What about y’all?</p>
