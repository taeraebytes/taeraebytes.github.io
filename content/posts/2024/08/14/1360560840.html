      <p>that's a bold faced lie it's about 60 ðŸ˜­ but there's an equal amount of cfans and jfans who got in maybe more but I counted the award list ig they're just used to being the overwhelming majority which I get

      <p>But zb1 is a kpop group to begin with. It is not their problem that people around the world are obsessed with kpop idols. And kchart is what decides if a kpop group os successful or not. Anyone can get millions of sales, it isn't extraordinary anymore. If they want to be successful then they'll have to cater to the kfans. Ngl I would be pissed too if I was a korean fan but wasn't able to meet them but obsessed foreigners could.</p>
