      <p>The reason is simply because yujin is also big and increase in fandom esp in china and they afraid about possibility that he might more popular than hao someday (again just "possibility ") while for hanbin, its been there since the beginning and the reason is very visible and predictable (this is also why they always freak out if its hanbin). They don't think Gyuvin is a competitor for them. And for Gunwook, the potential of being seen and like because of his talents</p>
