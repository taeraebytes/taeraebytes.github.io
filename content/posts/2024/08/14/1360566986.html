      <p>I wasn't gonna respond to this but seeing as how I got sent the same thing 5 times I'm really really gonna stress how much I don't care about these types of things and that I'm not a commentary cc. My patience is running super thin and I'm not trying to discuss any of this stuff if a hanbin fan says his aotm is the best that's their opinion I could give a lesser fuck about. Moving forward my tolerance for this is at 0 so don't expect me to reply and I'm probably gonna block this is so annoying the bait ccs gotta stop CUZ NOBODY CARES. Gosh

      <p>Omg I see it too ðŸ’€ 

Ughhh I fucking hate it when your anons do this cuz I never notice any of these things until your anons point it out and now that I'm aware of it it will be the only thing I'll be noticing about him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Same with Hao's chin implant line, I never noticed it until you and your anons point it out and now it's all I see and the first thing I see ðŸ˜­ At least for Hanbin it's only when his head is tilted up tho so ig it'll be less noticeable for me</p>

      <p>jfjsnvmmdndmmf same everytime something gets pointed out it never leaves my mind I never noticed the implant line before but it's like the first thing my eyes go to now and I'll probably be subconsciously looking out for the nostril too now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it's like Anton and wonbins hairlines I cannot stop looking at it whenever I see them
