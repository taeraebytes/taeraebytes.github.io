      <p>What isn’t jaejoong’s tea 😭 he got a dui (not nearly as bad as suga’s though and actually pretty low compared to most other idols/actors DUI scandals), kissed men predebut (photos exist irl mouth on mouth), joked about covid (okie this one needs to be explained a bit but it was early early on on April 1st, 2020 as a prank to ‘spread awareness of the virus” to his fans, to be fair  no one expected it back then to cause as many casualties as it would, it was too early to realize the magnitude of it), verbally abused and hit a sasaeng (which imo is okay, one of his group’s sasaeng’s literally tried killing and poisoning a different member with glue in his drink, TVXQ were known for having some of the worst sasaeng’s ever), made fun of homeless people (which is double wild because he was homeless growing up 😭), international dating scandals, made a weird misogynistic comment urging women to find men and up the falling birth rate, etc.</p>

      <p>I am sorry but the "he was kissing guys pre debut" kinda kills me if we compare to everything else like why did you include that 😭. That COVID joke was distasteful as hell and I still don't get why he still has that YouTube show on where he drinks with guest's after his ass got a DUI.</p>
