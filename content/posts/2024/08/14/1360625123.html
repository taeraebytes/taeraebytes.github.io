      <p>HELL NO as much as i want ricky to have more schedules i don't want him there again it was so hard watching that entire live where jaehyun was basically ignoring him and acknowledging every one else like idk if it was just me but any time ricky would speak he would just stare into the void and look all uninterested like wheres the professionalism they rlly just be hiring anyone as mcâ€™s like tbh him and sohee always have hanbin doing most of the job it's like why are y'all even there</p>

      <p>Myungjae is rlly bad vibes like we all know gyuvin doesn't like him at this point but Hao really seems to not vibe with him as well (jjangyuz really dislike the same people lol) he was rude to stayc and Ricky too I agree, he seems very self centered and like he's clout chasing</p>
