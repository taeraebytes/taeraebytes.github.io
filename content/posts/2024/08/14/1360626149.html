      <p>My spirit has officially been broken ITS OVER I LOST like I'm sorry the game is too tough and idk if I can do this anymore. cc dead makes it worse but I actually can't sit through gunwook being bullied it's gonna be almost 2 years soon and it persists.. he can't breathe wrong, he can't talk wrong, he can't look at someone wrong cuz he'll get hate even if he's perfect he'll get hate. These trolls are genuinely so nasty I truly believe they wanted to counteract his huge positive reception because they had to dig up a lengthy 8 month old live that was full of covers to pick a bad one. The lengths they go the obsession they have with him.. and it's allowed to happen because what happens every single time? Kzeroses ignore it kgpds ignore it the company ignores it nobody does anything like it's gotten to a point where even I can't take it and I know it's only gonna get worse. I'm already upset but yea me being here is also a mistake because trust and believe i get tortured in my inbox daily so this only makes it worse and it's also ammo like im past crash out idgaf if I sound dramatic I'm on my period and I was already sad I REALLY HOPE THE WORLD JUST ENDS TOMORROW I WANT TO CLOSE MY EYES AND I HOPE ZB1 DISAPPEARS AND CEASES TO EXIST. OPPS KEEP WINNING LETS JUST DIE BRUH ITS OVER WE LOST üòÇüôå</p>

      <p>queef take a breath, trolls will always be on idols‚Äô ass, a few qrts of trolls is not going to do any damage especially for this, like gunwook having one off moment is not going to harm him, he has had multiple incredible performances and people with braincells and those that matter are aware or will be aware in the future. as you said this is all because he has been gaining attention, it is always something that happens and it happens to many idols, just like it happens to other zb1 members, take some time off and don‚Äôt let this sadden you more than a few hours</p>

      <p>And this is why jinyoung left cix, this also why Eunseok will never be recognize as anything bc he's not even a visual, this is also why wonbin vocal skills will always be overshadowed by a member who it's probably not even coming back, and this is why sohee gets ignored by jaehyun and hanbin, and this is also why sungchan got overshadowed by the new members after sm did everything to push him during nct, and this is why shotaro will never be a singer, and this is why anton got that terrible nose job and will always be recognized as nepo.</p>

      <p>I am saying he gets overshadowed, not that he sings better, you know damn well that everytime they post clips about Wonbin and Sohee singing there's always someone with at least 500 likes yapping about Seunghan vocals üòå</p>
