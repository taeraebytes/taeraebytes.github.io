      <p>The Gunwook hate is 80% based on his looks, 15% based on the impression from the first few episodes of BP, 5% crazy akgaes (if we are ignoring other fandoms doing their typical trolling). I fully disagree with all of it (he’s my ult, please don’t shoot the messenger 😭). The sheer magnitude that haters hate on him because he’s not some skinny twink or has a super small v-line face is insane. It’s even crazier cuz dude is not even built, he’s pretty thin compared to literally most people anywhere else in the world. And he’s not ugly at all. They honestly drag him on the very few occasions when he doesn’t sing the best because they can’t drag his background because he was such a good kid growing up and hardworking and people love him. So what else can people who hate him do? Attack his looks that don’t 100% align with fake ass Korean beauty standards and make his small mistakes overblown. Obviously hate is never nice, and it sucks that most hating comments are calling him a fat, ugly pig or an incel (which is a crazy ass insult on so many levels, especially considering it’s Gunwook we’re talking about, an anti-bullying advocate who was part of an all-girl dance club of all people), but I genuinely have hope he’ll realize that the people saying that are insecure and that he isn’t fat or ugly at all. He’s never been the most confident regarding his looks (remember when he’d joke constantly about how he isn’t happy about his looks and make negative comments during debut era?) but I think he’s been gaining confidence recently. I also think him and Matthew getting closer can help because Matthew very much grew up in western culture and has a very idgaf attitude at criticism he doesn’t see as valid, plus he’s never made a negative comment about someone’s weight, is always trying to make Gunwook eat and telling him he’s pretty or handsome. The hate is 100% unfair but I hope it lessens your worries a little bit that he has a good support system, is loved by his members, is very intelligent so hopefully realizes that most hate is bullshit, and that he’s been more confidence recently. Gunwook karma will happen queef, rest assured.</p>

      <p>I mean right now it is yea but the hate train def culminated from the bp stuff obviously it's become a staple to make fun of his looks because he sticks out and it's easy to when someone doesn't have the same factory produced looks that are valued. only trolls watched the show at first and pretty much they latched onto the hate and grew it it's the usual big ktroll accts that start it and then eventually it caught on and stuck. They basically do the same thing to wonhee she got hate from the show and even though she's rlly pretty she doesn't 100% fit the standards she gets dragged baddddd they actually call wonhee and gunwook siblings to hate on them 😭 and sometimes they do drag him for the things he says (also the japan soccer thing blew up that way because UKLOB STARTED IT 🤬) it's not totally just his looks it's crazy because they'll just twist his words however they want he was talking about what he found difficult and easy during math AND THEY GAVE HIM HELL it was crazy they're going this far to dig into things they can diminish his talent with too like an 8 month old live is crazyyyyy. But I rmbr it used to make me so sad how bad they ruined his confidence he's got it back now but ngl these days he doesn't seem as enthusiastic to me rmbr when he said he's been having a hard time in his recent twt post 😕😕🙁🙁🙁🙁☹️☹️😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔 but yea Matthew obviously has helped him thru tough times I'm glad my worries come and go it's whatever I decided a longgg time ago I was gonna try my best to just enjoy whatever's left of this group like I'm rllly trying 🤦‍♀️ damn I kinda don't know why I wrote all this gunwooks just a victim we move IM WAITING ON THAT KARMA THO.................

      <p>i will always fuck with matthew for being the only member not to do the whole "at first i thought gunwook was some big scary thug" thing the thing that gets me is that most non-gpd zeroses have the same image of gunwook they just think it's sexy so they'll say stupid shit about him but act like it's a good thing</p>
