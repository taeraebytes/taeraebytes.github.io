      <p>ok but honestlyyyyyyyy things aren't too bad for zb1 at the moment if you ignore this decrepit ancient 2017 armys complaining about jin not having lines ass discourse like the comeback trailer is still banging the posters are still banging the production credits are still banging the sf version concept pics are still banging (we ignore the others) the boys have been raving about the comeback in ways they haven't done in the past the styling for events has been noticeably different, possibly upgraded meaning it'll probably be like that for the comeback LIKE. IT IS NOT THAT BAD idk why ppl are saying it's suddenly gotten bad bc it really hasn't and even then i didn't have many expectations anyway so what we have gotten has been pretty good TO ME</p>

      <p>same anon but iâ€™m just gonna add this on bc lots of the time when i say something on here ppl get aggro idk why maybe itâ€™s the way i word things but what i MEAN by the jin mention is no itâ€™s not the same situation bc hao gets way more lines than jin ever did in the early years yes hao is a lot more skilled vocally than jin thatâ€™s a no brainer my point is that whenever line distribution discourse happens it takes me right back to when i first became a kpop stan, an army specifically, all anyone would ever talk about was line distribution and jinâ€™s whole personality was handsome, funny, 0 lines like wow how fucking miserable. even then it was a bit annoying but i was 15 so i was a lil crazy kid and this was still one of the most important things in the world to me Apparently. now iâ€™m 22 and i really donâ€™t give that much of a fuck yet yâ€™all STILLLLLLLLLLL talk about line distribution and fairness til this day? not sick of it AT ALL? like i just canâ€™t with it</p>
