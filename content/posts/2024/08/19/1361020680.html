      <p>It wasnâ€™t just that his plus chat was spammed with alot of hate today and one of the things antis were saying was your dating, arenâ€™t you dating. But there were people calling him a bad leader, calling him selfish and his mnet plus post comments have been fucked since yesterday so it seems like heâ€™s adressing it all
