      <p>It wasnâ€™t just that his plus chat was spammed with alot of hate today and one of the things antis were saying was your dating, arenâ€™t you dating. But there were people calling him a bad leader, calling him selfish and his mnet plus post comments have been fucked since yesterday so it seems like heâ€™s adressing it all

      <p>kallins were also mad at some people making insenstive jokes, telling him what to do and what not to do and saying they'll watch other male idols fancams (to make him jealous ig) etc it's a lot of stuff but idk what he did address was the dating rumors tho</p>

      <p>yea I looked again so the dating stuff is the biggest thing but since it's been around for months I'm surprised he even said anything ig whole house mad but... everything is just so tense this cb has to be good or it's actually over

      <p>It seemed like he was tryna adress it all in general but the dating stuff has been going round for a while but it was getting bigger recently like with that random kkt pfp thing and that account spreading it was growing and people were posting on pann and shit about it too. Alottt of comments were asking if he was dating so itâ€™s not like he went out his way to bring it up but itâ€™s better to clear the air and ig it worked because that big troll account who was posting â€˜proofâ€™ of binrina deactivated right after the live .</p>

      <p>I mean the k fans donâ€™t really buy it like if you saw the qrts on that account before they deactivated they would get lashed so bad because no one was believing it but the account still have massive reach and a lot of traction and it was being talked about on a lot of different platforms soo he definitely saw it. I also think itâ€™s not just limited to the whole binrina thing but him just being someone whose comfortable with female idols in general has people saying heâ€™s dating xyz every other day</p>

      <p>I'm sure he's been aware of it for long I'm just surprised since it's just troll fuel rumors I guess today was just an act up plus the fact that pluschat makes it easier to see hate
