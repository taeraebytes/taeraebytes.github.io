      <p>It wasnâ€™t just that his plus chat was spammed with alot of hate today and one of the things antis were saying was your dating, arenâ€™t you dating. But there were people calling him a bad leader, calling him selfish and his mnet plus post comments have been fucked since yesterday so it seems like heâ€™s adressing it all

      <p>kallins were also mad at some people making insenstive jokes, telling him what to do and what not to do and saying they'll watch other male idols fancams (to make him jealous ig) etc it's a lot of stuff but idk what he did address was the dating rumors tho</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m actually really hopeful the cb will be amazing like all the members seem lit and excited for it and honestly I think this fandom might actually calm down once cb period hits</p>
