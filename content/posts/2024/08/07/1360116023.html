      <p>ngl this is why i sigh whenever i see ifans getting mad directly at journalists, broadcast companies, agencies because while i understand you are mad for some reason, you donâ€™t lash at them. you have to speak or ask politely because the people behind all this are human too just like fans. they have a limit that we should not cross and sometimes we just donâ€™t know what happens behind the scenes that lead to what you are upset about. our behavior towards them will affect on how they view the group because we are not at bts level for them to excuse fans behavior</p>
