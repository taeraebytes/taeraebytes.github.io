      <p>isnâ€™t taeil the main vocal? that would mean she does not hand the lines to the main vocals but to who suits the parts</p>

      <p>yea he is I mean doyoung is one too but taeils way better so yea she gives lines to who's voice she thinks suits it better... hmmmm considering the kind of vibe im getting for the tt + the fact that it'll be more vocal heavy i think haos fine im iffy about how she'll divide gunraebin + mattrick. Just cuz i feel like hao has the skill plus a malleable tone thats well liked taeraes just as skilled but idk how he'd suit the songs hanbins lighter tone paired w this kinda song i dont know think he'd be favored and gunwooks tone is good but like when does he ever get a lot he's treated as a singer less than Matthew and Ricky soooo idk ðŸ¤” let's try not to sweat it tbh we'll see

      <p>also it depends on the song and the disparaty between first and last place whether placement in line distribution even matters. i mean if youre consistently at the bottom it just sucks but imo being first in a song like sweat with actual melodic parts trumps being first in ftp where every line is monotonous and repetitive</p>

      <p>right last place could still be a decent amt of lines and definitely more worth it to have more in sweat
