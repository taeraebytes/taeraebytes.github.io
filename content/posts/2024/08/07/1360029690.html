      <p>Pretty sure jaehyun gave it to him since jaehyun was holding it up earlier and had it when bnd came then when bnd left hanbin came back with it. Would send links but nothing is working ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Btw did he kinda imply leejeong was nugu or was it a mistranslation ðŸ˜­ but I think it's funny how so many people think they're SO close to Hanbin it's really the Gemini energy I have this too if he's anything like me he talks mad shit in private to his few actually close friends</p>
