They give off first love but in a slightly toxic way. Like they know they aren’t fully compatible but for the sake of the trauma bond and proximity they keep trying.

Mattwook - it’s giving a sexual awakening for Gunwook but they never act on it. But even if they aren’t doing anything I think their dynamic means a lot to expanding Gunwook’s worldview. I also think Matthew truthfully sees him as a little brother he wants to tease. Odds of them being together is like maybe 15% but they both mean a LOT to each other in different ways and they have a special emotional connection. I also think they are each other’s comfort person and serves needs they both didn’t realize they needed (Matt constantly babying Gunwook, Gunwook admiring and being a comfortable, competent presence that gives Matt the freedom to be himself). They fulfill special roles for one another but I think that’s the extent of it.\n4. Mattrae - their whole dynamic is a game of gay chicken where Taerae would totally be down for something but Matt is just a huge flirt and wants to see how far he can go without committing. I don’t think they’ve done anything tho. 20% chance maybe that they’ve done stuff together but like they are always on the edge of doing something and breaking that boundary. Least likely to be committed together but most likely to have the highest tension,\n5. Riwook (this for you queef I remember your old riwook days): not together like at all 😭 but a super underrated friendship. There’s a level of mutual respect and adoration that most people don’t talk about between them. There have been several times you can catch ricky just smiling widely and babying Gunwook in his own way and a few times you can see Gunwook tease ricky but also respect his commitment to his persona and let’s him be who he wants to be without the relentless teasing ricky usually gets from other members (like Gyuvin). They also seem super comfortable with one another and I’d love to explore their dynamics more\n6. Jiwoong/Matthew: absolutely not, hell no ❌❌❌ while I don’t think Jiwoong is gay4pay or evil in that way I do think he’s 100% straight. Matthew enjoys the teasing and flirting because he just straight up is playful but Jiwoong doesn’t give off an ounce of genuine happiness or sincerity when he flirts with Matthew (or any member tbh). It feels so preplanned and rehearsed it’s icky.",
