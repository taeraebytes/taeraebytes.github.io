      <p>Just going to say this was another case of fans being too pessimistic again because a lot of other groups only had 1/2 meals but zerose got 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
Then the boys bought them ice cream too and they had goodbye gifts.
The snack bags werenâ€™t even small either like they had loads of full size snacks in hand picked by the members which is probably why the first meal was a bit lighter. Because there was still 2 snack bags and a full meal coming.</p>

      <p>Probably just like a free food coupon and tbh it was nice of them to do that because Iâ€™m vegan and itâ€™s rare for places whoâ€™ve made a set meal to gaf or change based on dietary restrictions</p>

      <p>I feel bad because while higher ups may be shit and that one weird yh manager that shouted at Ricky itâ€™s clear the boys actually like a lot of the staff that work with them and most are literally just trying to do their job and still getting lashed for stuff they probably have no control over</p>
