      <p>Gunwook on Music Core means more Sullyoon and Gunwook shipping nonsense. Like Gyuvin is right there, why did they choose Gunwook for the ship?</p>

      <p>i was minding my business in the gunwook tag when i came across a sullyoon ship video and it was the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen it was like "he's trying so hard to get her attention sullyoon is collecting these boys like pokemon" and it was gunwook just bowing in her direction like she wasn't even the nmixx member closest to him and the whole group was there so ofc he's gonna greet them i dont understand where this ship is coming from</p>
