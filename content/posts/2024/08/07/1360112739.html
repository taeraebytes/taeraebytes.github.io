      <p>Side note full of assumptions I thought of while making the shipping analysis I just sent you: I honestly think Gyuvin might have bpd on top of adhd (if weâ€™re talking armchair therapy: his clinginess, emotional highs and lows, almost too much loyalty it can be detrimental to himself, disregard for boundaries even if subconsciously, all indicate he fills up a ton of the symptoms and as someone very familiar with bpd I can see it ðŸ’¯). Also, I wonder if Hanbin ever tried applying the same self restrictive standards he placed on his own personality since debut to Matthew and if that caused a rift in their friendship. Obviously theyâ€™re still close af but something for sure has shifted and I think Gunwook is more relaxed than Hanbin is and gives Matt more freedom so I wonder if thatâ€™s why they grew super close and seem more like besties than what Mattbin are.</p>
