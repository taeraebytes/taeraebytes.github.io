      <p>My friend actually had this thought: what if by hot summer remake they mean the f(x) one...Kenzie main producer and she worked on hot summer, title could be a nod to bp and fx are inactive so less controversial than twiceðŸ‘€I'm not sure how they'd br able to buy it but that would be insane</p>
