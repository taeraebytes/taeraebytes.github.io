      <p>jiwoong stans are being embarrassing as hell in the poor interviewerâ€™s replies because thereâ€™s no answer from jiwoong and she told them he chose not to say anything and she wasnâ€™t going to force him</p>

      <p>thry genuinely operate in the worst way possible because we have 17 yr olds running the fandom and everyone's new to kpop while akgaeism isn't as rampant jiwoong fans take liberty on anything omgggg ðŸ˜­

      <p>kinda related but I really think the reason zb1 didn't get any group mags deals anymore bc the akgaes used to attack them (bcs of center/formation things) it ruined their image and now nobody wanna work with them ðŸ˜ž</p>

      <p>I think there's truth to that for sure but it's probably a bit different in korea since they're much bigger there but idk

      <p>tbh I've been thinking, magazine directors? probably focus more on artistic direction since they are artists in their own way so if one person always has to be in the center I can see them finding it constricting and even annoying but they know if they don't they'll get backlash from that sf, so I can see them just avoiding us tbh</p>

      <p>right right imagine one of your job details literally being controlled by an outside source not even a company demand or something within your own workplace. Like damn the composition can't be exact every time
