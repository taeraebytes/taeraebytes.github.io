Overworked muscles repair themselves the most when someone is sleeping thatâ€™s why itâ€™s especially important for people who are more active to sleep well because it gives more time for the muscles to repair and restore themselves, lack of sleep means the body has less time to do this and increase the risk of worsening any muscle damage or pain a person may already have or put them at bigger risk of it.",

      <p>Saw a moot mention this and Iâ€™ve had it happen to me too but exhaustion and dehydration can cause sever muscle spasms and cramps especially in the legs where the large muscles are so the overworking and lack of sleep is definitely physically taking a toll on them and probably why Yujin was having problems with his legs</p>
