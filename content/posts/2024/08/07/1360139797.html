      <p>i hope imsuho isn't totallyyyyyyyy discarded again this comeback bc they contributed quite a bit to yits and melting point and u can hear this Certain sound which just makes up zb1 which likely comes from them but with yhmah it feels less like the sound that was built up for them and more like random songs thrown together (which it could well have been for yits/melpo but it sounds a lot more cohesive and i like majority of the songs better)..... tho if producers that are at kenzie's level are all through this tracklist i may forgive them just bc the quality will be so good and high.</p>
