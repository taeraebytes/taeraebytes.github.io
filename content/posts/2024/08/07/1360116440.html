      <p>he like never talks about non-kpop stuff other than some chinese artists and mentioning adele like twice so my first thought was all the afrobeats that's been in kpop like txt and le sserafim but nah the way it's worded it actually does sound like the actual stuff but i just wouldn't expect that of him ðŸ˜­</p>
