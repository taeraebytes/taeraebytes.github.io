      <p>oh I opened this wayyyyy earlier but it's this "I think the kids' personal Instagram account will come out soon.

Kim Gyu-bin two days ago? Let me know the date of the comeback in the rabang and there's one more~ It was like this.

Kim's Instagram scaffolding is also gone..

It's time to come here. I'm nervous."
