      <p>Not sure what you’ve seen yet but I’m sharing these bc they’re code-worded on instiz so a little hard to find. Pretty much everyone there who isn’t a deranged wish akgae (who seem to be gaining notoriety on the k-side) or a pre-established troll is sympathetic to gw bc it’s blatantly obvious there was no malicious intent or even personal fault in him falling and the person in front of him falling too, whether it was due to accidental contact or the faulty tarp. I know I’m preaching to the choir here but it’s kinda tragic he’s so regularly beat up and genuinely degraded by trolls on that side to the point where non-fans know it and pity him and even expect it while still calling out the illogic and extremeness, and meanwhile I-zeroses are completely oblivious and useless acting like he doesn’t get hate and protect accs devote all their time to calling out fans for being the decrepit age of 21 or not freaking out over stupid easily disprovable piercing rumors.

      <p>so far I've seen the track video and the fans fighting each other I'm actually surprised this time around gunwook was being defended by zeroses it's usually so heartbreaking whenever he gets a lot of hate nobody defends him. I've seen the apology video getting a lot of good attention and mostly it seems to have calmed down but I'm still just upset because no matter what gunwook does there will always be people waiting to jump him literally the same could've happened to anyone else the reaction would've been different just like how that nct wish sion guy pushed someone on accident ppl sided with him and said the issue is isac but when gunwook tripped and scraped his arm he gets the worst things said about him😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑. But you're right his hate train is so recognized most people can already predict what people will do to ridicule him over small shit like it's that known it's almost every fucking week omgggg and ifans rlly don't have a clue that's why I was always so sensitive to shade gunwook would get on the iside and start fighting w ppl LIKE THESE HOES REALLY DONT HAVE A CLUE......... ugh it's just so upsetting im glad normal people understood and stuff but damn gunwook will get attacked for nothing for eternity huh

      <p>Just about the end but for I zerose me and loads of my non gpd moots were calling out those wish stans who were dragging Gunwook but then a lot of gpd including that big one mono started guilting people saying we shouldn’t blow it up and to let the k side deal with it which is why a lot of people either don’t know or are unsure now how to respond</p>

      <p>mono is just a big dumb bitch she thinks she's the president of gpds and can tell how people to act I don't like her one bit she is part of the reason why shit gets the way it is if the kside handled shit this wouldn't be happening in the first place they don't ever the kside would much rather ignore his hate train than defend him LMAOAOAOO. I hate her and her clique with a passion they take people defending gunwook as negative it's so baffling like the reason gpds disliked me is cuz she said i was wrong for fighting with allins and bringing gunwook hate 😭😭 this is why gpds will stay useless and annoying forever YALL CAN HAVE THAT 😂✌️

      <p>idek what it is with her she literally discourages people from defending gunwook i think she thinks it's better or smth but people treat him like a punching bag that's doesn't work. But igpds tend to be scaredy cats not much is gonna change lol

      <p>i have a lot to say about this strange and corny gpd who tweets with the wit and sincerity of an MLM hun but i'll just leave it at this for now: there is something so offputting about how she would constantly crosspost these unhinged yet largely one-off and baseless anonymous hate ccs about gunwook onto twt and publicly victimize him for the purpose of stoking fan outrage and sympathy and parasocially sucking it up for herself, only to then preach peace love and pacifism in the face of actual substancial hate that would feasibly be visible to him.</p>

      <p>There's so much to say about that heifer... but right it's just so weirdly calculated to me you can bring weird hate that is almost always fake/incorrect so she can correct and swoop in its sooooooo odd but gunwook being slandered by the masses is aight HOE YOU GOT IT 😂🙌 like im sorry i hate that fraud so much she the root of every annoyance i have
