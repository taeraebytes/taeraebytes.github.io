      <p>Love how they cropped the clip because 2 seconds after it ends Yujin literally walks off to where the rest of the boys are walking ðŸ˜‚ like they went over to check on him what more do they want them to do none of these boys are medics who can help him with the pain</p>

      <p>Saw a moot mention this and Iâ€™ve had it happen to me too but exhaustion and dehydration can cause sever muscle spasms and cramps especially in the legs where the large muscles are so the overworking and lack of sleep is definitely physically taking a toll on them and probably why Yujin was having problems with his legs</p>
