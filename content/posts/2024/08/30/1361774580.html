      <p>I'm not surprised people are shocked by the news because this news is always shocking, but personally i always thought it'd be common sense that most depraved male idols (and people in general) would opt for an inconspicuous down-to-earth homebody persona like Taeil over an attention-seeking, openly perverted one like Seungri. I know not all behavior exhibited by idols is pre-meditated or voluntary, as they are human not machine, but willingly reducing your own public exposure under the guise of introversion and upholding relatable humanistic values like privacy and modesty surely cuts down on the effort needed to act innocent or publicly assuage your own conscience, assuming they have one. Obviously any persona could be a mask for a monster, but I think Seungri's case made people think the 'hide in plain sight' approach is more stereotypical among idols than it actually is. What I'm trying to say is, look out for the quiet ones. They get away with things bc they arrogantly yet often correctly assume no one's paying them any mind.</p>

      <p>I can agree with that I think a lot of it also fans will fill in the gaps of an idol for themselves because we don't know them as people so depending on where u interact it's different I think overall the nice quiet guy image was something taeil had in almost every community but yea to me these kinds of personalities are up there with the hide in plain sight stuff

      <p>another anon and kinda disagree, I think if anything this case and the student deepfake case aka nth room 2.0 just taught us that it can be anybody not just look out for 'this' or 'that' or only those ppl with those 'image' or 'personalities' are capable of these things. We literally saw how ones own blood brother is in these very rooms sending pics of their own sister, mom and female cousins.

cause same can be said about loud extroverted idols, you can say they're being extra loud and overly friendly to coverup for some shady stuff bts, pushing the loud extroverted who's nice to everyone persona so fans wont suspect that this guy whos friendly with many male and female idols, who does tiktoks with every idol they meet, praised by staff for being friendly is capable of this kinda thing because they seemed 'safe' because so many idols interacted with them so there's no way they'd do something like participate in nth rooms 2.0. I mean one of the biggest shock was that one korean tiktoker, the mama guy like with his content and the way he presented himself as this loud funny guy no one expected him to be a rapist but he was.

I don't know just after everything we saw the past week to me there's no such thing as watch out for this or that cause anyone can be in those rooms or capable of sa. men are men and it sucks for the good men out there but it is what it is</p>

      <p>okay maybe I wasn't clear or I interpreted it differently obviously after the second nth room and this police case that should obviously be what everyone thinks. Nobody is exempt no kind of personality is but they mean the whole surprise of this like yes nobody should expect or think their favorite idol is a rapist but for the first part of the news hitting the tl it was more about people thinking someone like taeil could never do this. when in fact they can I don't think people should expect this but in other smaller cases it's used as an excuse or a shield like other smaller scandals or when there's comments there's so many male idols who've had their past stuff dug up and it's never taken serious. But of course I agree with you and the previous cc it's not about watching out for signs anyone is capable but it's just touching on the initial reaction

      <p>(Original anon everyone is mad at here) Y'all we are literally making the same point. The only reason I was highlighting Taeil is because of the common rhetoric that his revelation was shocking due to him seeing normal and assuming. That rhetoric is WRONG and naive because obviously ANY PERSONALITY CAN BE THE PERSONA OF A PREDATOR. I shouldnt have said 'look out for the quiet ones,' as that was easy to misinterpret, so I'm sorry for that.</p>

      <p>Right ðŸ˜­ that's why I'm confused ig people lasered in on that last bit but it's really just about how people usually use personality types to justify stuff like yes no one should expect someone they like to be a rapist but there was alotttttt a lot of tweets about never expecting it from taeil not cuz he's a man but because of who they thought he was ur good tho I hope my responses got the points across I got what u meant lol

      <p>Thank you for being literate and understanding me omfg now im fucking pissed though bc how tf am i or anyone else "forgetting about the victims" by analyzing the ways famous predators publicly present themselves and the naive ways fans receive them. do people really think theyre doing useful activism by shutting down topical conversations on twitter or even a fucking CC? if anyone thinks the Taeil sitch is overshadowing the ongoing convos about misogynistic korean men they're clearly new to this convo and only getting their activism from kpop twitter bc that is absolutely NOT happening in SK and im saying this as someone whose been following korean radfems for 5+ years. idols arent covering up SHIT.</p>
