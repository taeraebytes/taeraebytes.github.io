      <p>What was she even expecting when the only catchy songs were the singles she released before the album and Maria but the time for Maria to chart was during 2022 when Harry Styles was releasing songs like As it was. Meanwhile her previous albums had catchy bangers after catchy bangers</p>

      <p>It would be fine with something that at least matched her self titled album level but instead she wanted to release this snooze fest.</p>
