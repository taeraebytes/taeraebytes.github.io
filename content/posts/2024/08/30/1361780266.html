      <p>I know people have mixed feelings about him but thatâ€™s the beauty of having worked with him since debut is that he really knows how to show their strengths</p>

      <p>I'm a Ricky stan and I love Im Suho because, wait first off imma point out idgaf about who got the most lines and who got the least but I have to talk about it in order to get me point crossed. Ricky had the least lines in Good so Bad and second last in Kill the Romeo but the difference is Im Suho understands his strengths so all his lines were meant for him and was impactful whereas Good so Bad Kenzie gave him whack as lines with heavy ass layering/ mixing it doesn't even sound like him. Same with Hanbin, Hao Taerae chorus like who tf was singing???? I couldn't even tell until the performance vid dropped ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ So I get why rosins and allins were fighting, don't misunderstand Kenzie is a really good producer but Good so Bad felt incomplete like I'm still hungry but Feel the Romeo just felt like our song and felt complete and I loved every second of it because every member shined I mean he made Jiwoong sound good ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Still thinking why Ricky didn't get one saranghaneunde in gsb. We would sound so good in that because of his tone and vibrato. It would sound better with thicker voice like Ricky's. They should have made it Ricky then Hanbin with his airy voice and higher pitch. They missed the bridge slayage. These people don't really have vision</p>

      <p>can someone explain to me without being a hater how his falsetto in the encore was 'bad'? I watched the studio recording of ftp and he sang it exactly the same as the recording and it's just horrible song direction/ planning because he was doing both falsetto and the low register at the same time so how could he do both and that's why it sounded 'off' during the encore but it was because there was no low register accompanying him like the song. I'm not even a Ricky stan but I feel like people are doing way too much with that encore because his falsetto sounds the same as the recording ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I think from a technical stand point it wasn't bad? But he took the higher part which is quieter in the studio version so it was surprising to hear and it just sounded messy and uncomfortable. People did do way too much and the song is a very difficult one to sing comparing it to other bad encores it wasn't nearly as terrible it was also yujin being offkey they just got more flack cuz they're zb1

      <p>Yeah he sang it right but from matthews normal voice to his sudden falsetto it threw ppl off cause his mic was loud too and I think people misunderstood the shock as being bad even though he sang it right. To be honest besides us nobody knows ftp ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ So they probably didn't know the falsetto was intentional and he sang it on key so that's why in the other encores he sang in his normal voice but not because his falsetto was bad but his normal voice is more comfortable for the listener if he could only choose to do one.

Glad queefy brought up yujin cause now I dont feel as guilty calling him out but yeah he actually sang his falsetto off key but barely got any slack or nobody is holding it against him to this day like ricky even though he did his right but ricky is also ricky so its never about right or wrong when it comes to him just like zb1 ppl just camp our shit waiting to blow up anything thats slighty 'wrong'</p>
