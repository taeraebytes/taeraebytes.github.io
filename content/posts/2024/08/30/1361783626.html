Sohee definitely likes taerea and zb1. he watched their cb showcase he is just awkward and doesn't know how to approach tr
Actually zb1 are lovable and sociable. Please let's stop this begging agenda with each interaction they've</p>

      <p>Ok he smiled at him congrats... and yes taerae was begging it like we all saw their first few interactions and he'd mention sohee and it was crickets on the other side but taerae isn't new to begging like he got itttttt and sohee is hard to socialize with and a bad communicator so ghosting is likely anyways ugh why'd i just get irked I rlly don't like that guy
