      <p>Bad news is that, our only KBS shows are 2D1N and that Hanbin-Gyuvin guesting. When we won last FTP because we had Lee Mujin, 2D1N, Eunchar diary, Superman and another one I forgot. Lesserafim will get the win if we don't do radio guestings</p>

      <p>But the digitals data that music shows use come out on Thursday while Lesserafim comeback is on Friday, no? So for mcountdown, the show and show champion they won't have digital points.</p>

      <p>There will be digital points for mcountdown it's just that lesserafim prob will not have broadcast points. And they can just catch up in 3 days for digital</p>

      <p>I donâ€™t think so zb1 went on perf 37 lsfm are going on studio choom. Tbh both are basically the same thing just under different names but most of the time itâ€™s recorded in the same studio and the production is nearly identical.</p>
