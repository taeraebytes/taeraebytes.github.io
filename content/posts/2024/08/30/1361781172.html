      <p>I know people have mixed feelings about him but thatâ€™s the beauty of having worked with him since debut is that he really knows how to show their strengths</p>

      <p>I'm a Ricky stan and I love Im Suho because, wait first off imma point out idgaf about who got the most lines and who got the least but I have to talk about it in order to get me point crossed. Ricky had the least lines in Good so Bad and second last in Kill the Romeo but the difference is Im Suho understands his strengths so all his lines were meant for him and was impactful whereas Good so Bad Kenzie gave him whack as lines with heavy ass layering/ mixing it doesn't even sound like him. Same with Hanbin, Hao Taerae chorus like who tf was singing???? I couldn't even tell until the performance vid dropped ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ So I get why rosins and allins were fighting, don't misunderstand Kenzie is a really good producer but Good so Bad felt incomplete like I'm still hungry but Feel the Romeo just felt like our song and felt complete and I loved every second of it because every member shined I mean he made Jiwoong sound good ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Still thinking why Ricky didn't get one saranghaneunde in gsb. We would sound so good in that because of his tone and vibrato. It would sound better with thicker voice like Ricky's. They should have made it Ricky then Hanbin with his airy voice and higher pitch. They missed the bridge slayage. These people don't really have vision</p>

      <p>diff anon and I'm surprised no one has said this I mean I know Ricky's known for the bridge (for a good reason and I agree with anons point) but am I the only one thinking how good he'll sound during Matthew's first verse?</p>

      <p>not really, the song needs to start bright & rickyâ€™s tone would only set the wrong vibe imo</p>
