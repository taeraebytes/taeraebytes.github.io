      <p>as expected sm was trying to bury taeil crimes because he still promoted walk despite being booked they only kicked him out because they had too much proof against him i even read that man just left the group not the agency they need to investigate more

      <p>yea I expected that but didn't he re-sign so both he and sm are legally bound and sm would have to pay a termination fee I think? And they're not doing that so he'll continue to be in the agency but he's out of the group
