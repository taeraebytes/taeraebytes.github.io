      <p>This is so weird like it might sound bitter but whatâ€™s the point of making the survival show if youâ€™re going to make a 2.0 group and add in the trainees you wanted anyway ðŸ˜­ like if I knew it was going to become a thing I wouldnâ€™t have died so hard for my 1 pick to debut because they were probably going to get put in another group anyway</p>
