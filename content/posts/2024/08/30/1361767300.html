      <p>Sorry but using line distributions from that one yt account that botched most of the distributions when actually fan cuts of his lines are a lot diffrent is weird. I’m not saying he didn’t have a lot of line but he didn’t have the big diffrence like people make out e.g 40 seconds in ktr is just not true 🧍🏾‍♀️. Also they didn’t really gag him when the question was asked months ago and this poster is saying it like hb consistently receives the most lines in all their songs when that isn’t even the case.</p>

      <p>I know you’re not and I get it’s not that deep but the way he’s been lashed over lines the last few days is crazy especially when no one was publicly lashing yj for having the most lines in ftp or Matthew in sweat (I’m not saying they should be) it’s just wild how people can spread mis info like skewed like distributions to push a narrative and everyone runs with it or doesn’t even fact check.</p>

      <p>You guys are dumb. Neithrr zhang hao or hanbin would have half of the lines if they just pushed zhang hao as center normally. Instead, they want to push hanbin and give him the most lines. 2 centers means the distribution gets skewed and the rest of the members have nothing.</p>
