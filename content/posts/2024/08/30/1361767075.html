      <p>I'm not surprised people are shocked by the news because this news is always shocking, but personally i always thought it'd be common sense that most depraved male idols (and people in general) would opt for an inconspicuous down-to-earth homebody persona like Taeil over an attention-seeking, openly perverted one like Seungri. I know not all behavior exhibited by idols is pre-meditated or voluntary, as they are human not machine, but willingly reducing your own public exposure under the guise of introversion and upholding relatable humanistic values like privacy and modesty surely cuts down on the effort needed to act innocent or publicly assuage your own conscience, assuming they have one. Obviously any persona could be a mask for a monster, but I think Seungri's case made people think the 'hide in plain sight' approach is more stereotypical among idols than it actually is. What I'm trying to say is, look out for the quiet ones. They get away with things bc they arrogantly yet often correctly assume no one's paying them any mind.</p>

      <p>I can agree with that I think a lot of it also fans will fill in the gaps of an idol for themselves because we don't know them as people so depending on where u interact it's different I think overall the nice quiet guy image was something taeil had in almost every community but yea to me these kinds of personalities are up there with the hide in plain sight stuff

      <p>another anon and kinda disagree, I think if anything this case and the student deepfake case aka nth room 2.0 just taught us that it can be anybody not just look out for 'this' or 'that' or only those ppl with those 'image' or 'personalities' are capable of these things. We literally saw how ones own blood brother is in these very rooms sending pics of their own sister, mom and female cousins.

cause same can be said about loud extroverted idols, you can say they're being extra loud and overly friendly to coverup for some shady stuff bts, pushing the loud extroverted who's nice to everyone persona so fans wont suspect that this guy whos friendly with many male and female idols, who does tiktoks with every idol they meet, praised by staff for being friendly is capable of this kinda thing because they seemed 'safe' because so many idols interacted with them so there's no way they'd do something like participate in nth rooms 2.0. I mean one of the biggest shock was that one korean tiktoker, the mama guy like with his content and the way he presented himself as this loud funny guy no one expected him to be a rapist but he was.

I don't know just after everything we saw the past week to me there's no such thing as watch out for this or that cause anyone can be in those rooms or capable of sa. men are men and it sucks for the good men out there but it is what it is</p>

      <p>okay maybe I wasn't clear or I interpreted it differently obviously after the second nth room and this police case that should obviously be what everyone thinks.
