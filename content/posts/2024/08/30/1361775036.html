      <p>Someone mentioned that the big reason why are sales are probably so low daily is that the film version doesn’t ship till the 30th so people who ordered multiple versions or big group orders probably aren’t going to get shipped till then. Which means hopefully our numbers should go up by a lot on the tomorrow because the film version along with the other versions in the same order should be all good to ship</p>
