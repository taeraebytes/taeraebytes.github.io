      <p>I'm not surprised people are shocked by the news because this news is always shocking, but personally i always thought it'd be common sense that most depraved male idols (and people in general) would opt for an inconspicuous down-to-earth homebody persona like Taeil over an attention-seeking, openly perverted one like Seungri. I know not all behavior exhibited by idols is pre-meditated or voluntary, as they are human not machine, but willingly reducing your own public exposure under the guise of introversion and upholding relatable humanistic values like privacy and modesty surely cuts down on the effort needed to act innocent or publicly assuage your own conscience, assuming they have one. Obviously any persona could be a mask for a monster, but I think Seungri's case made people think the 'hide in plain sight' approach is more stereotypical among idols than it actually is. What I'm trying to say is, look out for the quiet ones. They get away with things bc they arrogantly yet often correctly assume no one's paying them any mind.</p>

      <p>I can agree with that I think a lot of it also fans will fill in the gaps of an idol for themselves because we don't know them as people so depending on where u interact it's different I think overall the nice quiet guy image was something taeil had in almost every community but yea to me these kinds of personalities are up there with the hide in plain sight stuff

      <p>? Nah it's not look out for quiet ones or the publicly horny ones it's look out for the quiet ones, the nerds, the popular one, the friendly one, the school athlete, the teachers, the classmates, the co worker, the boss, the guy friend, the corner store clerk, the janitor, the ceo, the doctor, the idol, the actor, the entertainer, the social influencer and your own god damn brother ugh just anyone with a fucking dick.... ngl i hate how taeil is being used as a scape goat-ish because this should've never been about taeil, I mean no shit he should get punished for what he did but now the focus has shifted when it should be about punishing and calling out korean men and the crimes korean men have done against korean women cuz now everyone is only talking about taeil and forgetting about the victims in those deepfake kakaotalk chat rooms turning it into a game guessing and making stupid lists about which idols may be part of the 200 list

like we lost the fucking plot, taeil is taking all the heat when it should be taeil AND those korean men but no ones talking about those deepfake kakaotalk chatrooms anymore like theres some shady shit going on and no one noticed.</p>

      <p>that's obvious they're just talking about the fact that this kind of front/personality is an easier slip ofc literally any personality is capable of being a criminal it's not exclusive. In the case of being an idol of course no one's going to assume or try to guess who's a rapist and who isn't they shouldn't have to and it shouldn't happen but there's a kind of cushion? stereotype? that people use to excuse things I'm speaking in smaller scandal wise like for example the 5p scandal. ofc the focus of the second nth room for intl twt has shifted towards taeil and just kpop idols in general but I don't see much or engage with that so that's never what I'm trying to speak towards. but this cc was I guess about idols and personalities cuz a lot of people have been stuck on the fact of "expecting" things or not obviously this is about deep rooted misogyny in korea and men in general

      <p>hmmmmm now that I think about it do yall think Taeil was a coverup? Or at least what anon said a scape goat to take the gp attention and rage away from the Korean student in those chatrooms? Because at least for Taeil there's a face to throw their tomatoes at</p>

      <p>no this only brings more international attention to the issue and it definitely made the case bigger because of his suspected involvement. I think now that there's a public figure tied to it it just calls for other high profile individuals who could be in there to be exposed as well

      <p>Yeah if anything his case coming out is making a lot more people tune into what’s happening in kr because I had a friend (who isn’t even into kpop at all) ask me about it because they saw the news of his case and then like other things being linked to it like the telegram thing so it’s actually opening up a lot of room for people to have a voice and bring proper international light onto what’s going on and hopefully get proper justice for the victims</p>
