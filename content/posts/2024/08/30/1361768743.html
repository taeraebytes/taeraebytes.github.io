      <p>I'm not surprised people are shocked by the news because this news is always shocking, but personally i always thought it'd be common sense that most depraved male idols (and people in general) would opt for an inconspicuous down-to-earth homebody persona like Taeil over an attention-seeking, openly perverted one like Seungri. I know not all behavior exhibited by idols is pre-meditated or voluntary, as they are human not machine, but willingly reducing your own public exposure under the guise of introversion and upholding relatable humanistic values like privacy and modesty surely cuts down on the effort needed to act innocent or publicly assuage your own conscience, assuming they have one. Obviously any persona could be a mask for a monster, but I think Seungri's case made people think the 'hide in plain sight' approach is more stereotypical among idols than it actually is. What I'm trying to say is, look out for the quiet ones. They get away with things bc they arrogantly yet often correctly assume no one's paying them any mind.</p>

      <p>I can agree with that I think a lot of it also fans will fill in the gaps of an idol for themselves because we don't know them as people so depending on where u interact it's different I think overall the nice quiet guy image was something taeil had in almost every community but yea to me these kinds of personalities are up there with the hide in plain sight stuff
