      <p>Someone mentioned that the big reason why are sales are probably so low daily is that the film version doesnâ€™t ship till the 30th so people who ordered multiple versions or big group orders probably arenâ€™t going to get shipped till then. Which means hopefully our numbers should go up by a lot on the tomorrow because the film version along with the other versions in the same order should be all good to ship</p>

      <p>Exactly! Even some Kfans are complaining because theirs aren't shipped yet when they're just around the corner. Wakeone is really so wrong releasing those articles when they know we aren't getting 1M until that version comes out. And Zeroses should stop embarassing us by lashing on Hanteo when they're just counting the shipped albums.</p>

      <p>I ordered like 50 ðŸ«¡ albums and none have been shipped and Iâ€™m 99% sure itâ€™s because thereâ€™s film ver in the order ðŸ˜­. Like Iâ€™m so positive the numbers will spike again tomorrow and if they do itâ€™s really clear thatâ€™s why they werenâ€™t as high as expected the first day.</p>
