      <p>this sucks basically a random kpop ed acct posted a list of idols who they think is involved in the nth room all in all just troll rage bait it originally had 0 traction and yes it is a dangerous tweet but again this is the internet. I didn't see any kind of commotion till a skz report acc posted about it which garnered attention and obviously the other protect accts of the other idols mentioned took action the post got deleted and the page is gone now
