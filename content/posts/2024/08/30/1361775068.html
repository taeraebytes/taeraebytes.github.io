      <p>Anon we really gotta lock in like weâ€™re predicted wins for mca, show champion, music core and the show but we could really go home empty handed if we donâ€™t stay consistent because the gaps are not big at all and when lsfm comeback drops our biggest advantage (physical sales) will drop and we will end up with less points then when we go up against weaker selling groups. We really need to lock in on all areas ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>We're only predicted to win because lsf isn't here yet. Wait for then to bump us to 2nd and lower our points in everything. ðŸ˜­</p>
