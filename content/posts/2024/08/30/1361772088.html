      <p>I actually hate when idols perform at acting/ drama award cuz you just know these actors look down on them. My old ults performed at one and ong the crowd was so dead it just ruined the whole perf because the camera would pan to the crowd and they would all be sat there like ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ and Iâ€™d get more irked when Iâ€™d see the idol actors too like bitch that could have been you at least spare a smile</p>
