    "question": "There is one good news - telegram founder being held accountable for creating a breeding ground for CP and sexual exploitation. Maybe this’ll scare other chatroom developers into better censorship on their platforms and help aid in getting classified documents of users to investigators. Imagine how much pain could be saved if chatroom forums like the nth room didn’t exist. It’s not event a question of freedom of speech or whatever, it’s necessary government oversight to protect individuals (often children or women) from being harassed, blackmailed, or worse. I hope this has a domino effect. \n\nx\ncom/popbase/status/1828899233719590932?s=46",
