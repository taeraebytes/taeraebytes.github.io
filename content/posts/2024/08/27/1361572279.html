      <p>The choruses are so funny. The layerinhg and mixing are terrible but the song overall sounds nice. The Krosins are happy with Zhang Hao's lines. Can we kill those Indonesian tweakers? I'm a Rosin and my only problem is Zhang Hao dancing at the sides or back most of the time but I have no problem with the lines. I love the cute rap too. Never mind the other questionable line but Hao has decent line. I'm happy. Let's chart higher. I'm gonna glaze my KRosin friends to work their ass off. We got  10, 849 ULs</p>
