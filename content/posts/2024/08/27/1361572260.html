      <p>sorry this is just insane like why's he the only one being highlighted as a main dancer despite there being 2 other great dancers but taerae a main vocal and a great singer doesn't even get to sing like he deserves? i used to not get bothered by this but it's just so unfair and doesn't make sense he's so favored</p>
