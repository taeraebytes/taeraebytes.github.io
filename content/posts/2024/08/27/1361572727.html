      <p>It's almost painful how many people still talk bad about the whole crush/melting point era and aesthetic just because there was a short noisy dance break in the title track. When I think of last winters kpop comebacks I immediately think of melting point</p>

      <p>I listen to the instrumental all the time and sorry the chorus isn't even that noisy or crazy it's just the shouty chorus that made it more apparent like ugh I HATE CRUSH HATE ITS SUCH A GOOD SONG
