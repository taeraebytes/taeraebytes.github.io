    "question": "idk why but I can’t get behind this song cuz the chorus’ melody isn’t good. The verses are so much better but the chorus fell flat for me & that makes or breaks a song for me personally. Im also just tired of the retro ish feel it has cuz u alr know worn out that genre is in kpop so this cb just feels like they’ve tried their hardest to have a hit by implementing qualities of songs that have done well in the past hence the song came out disappointing IMO",
    "reply": "yea everyone's entitled to their own opinion the genres has been dusted but I feel like the song at least had good replay value and I think it'll age well but stages make everything better imo"
