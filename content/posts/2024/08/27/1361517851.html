      <p>I agreed with the first part because I was thinking of my baobei Zhang Hao being seen as gay by these international kpop fans instead of being an artist and then they say something about forcing queer idols to come out and help push anti-discrimination law. Hell nawww!

      <p>She definitely gets off track but she's right it would always shock me how kpop fans use not only a western lense to decide who they think is gay but also theeee most stereotypical stuff too but she definitely went off rails people are focusing so much more on the last thing she said rather than her other good points
