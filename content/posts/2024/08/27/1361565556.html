      <p>rosin here and my only complaint is the choreography like why is he not centre for his own parts except for the last chorus ðŸ˜­ got so annoyed when he shared his intro dance with hb, the 'rap' was cute but again he was on the side! cant he have a solo moment for a sec ugh but other than I'm happy I'm lit 

but also I have a doubt, does anyone else think the part where it goes 'all of youuuuu~ nuni busyeo, good so bad' is just hao? cuz when I was watching the mv, it didnt sound like rk yj or jw, like I only hear hao everytime that line is sung</p>

      <p>that's understandable for sureeee but I agree it sounds like hao to me in every one of those parts probably another case of extreme layering
