      <p>Might be an unpopular opinion ðŸ˜­ but this is the first cb where I really dgaf about like distribution. Iâ€™d probably feel different if I was a riyangi but my bias had a good amount of line imo and the song is really good and the sales and charts are doing well so I donâ€™t really feel this need to be doom and gloom ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I'd probably be ending it if I was a riyangi but I agree I didn't even try to line or screen count when I watching the mv and listening to the album it was too good I do feel for them but at least Ricky himself is excited as well like this is gonna be a good era
