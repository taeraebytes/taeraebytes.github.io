    "question": "lmao this is funny bc for me this album doesn't feel cohesive at all like the sea being right after kill the romeo is hilarious. BUT i will say it makes a lot more sense than yhmah for example as at least this one has the concept that they all represent different film genres so i guess it's cohesive in terms of following a concept but sound? not really. love the album regardless tho, i like all the songs i think",
