      <p>melon daily chart for first day is out for reference:

in bloom (83), ul 69149
crush (108) ul 43242
feel the pop (180) ul 27790
good so bad (133) ul 29616

they were really kings during in bloom wow but this seems to line up with what we've been sensing, there's been a decline from crush but things are looking better than sweat/ftp eras. from ftp to now we haven't really seen an increase in gp interest but the fandom is more engaged for this cb</p>
