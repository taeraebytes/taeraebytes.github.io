      <p>Do you think that we can win music shows? I think we probably can get the show or/and show champion only</p>

      <p>I think we'll get music bank we have a couple days before lsfm drop and even then their other categories besides digitals won't be as good and there's still a good shot at mcountdown they put a good fight when they came back with ftp which was so weak and they were up against the likes of aespa

 mca is actually possible esp if this charts at least like in bloom did but zerose really need to lock in for sns esp yt shorts. We only had a 1400 point gap last time and this is when supernova was 1 on like every chart. We also need to win the voting with massive gaps to reduce the amount of points they get from it.</p>
