    "question": "I don’t think it’s a bad thing people think Kenzie orchestrated the shit line distribution 😶 likeeee I’d rather people be angry at a boogeyman they can’t interact with and think it’s outside of the company’s responsibilities then fans blame WakeOne and as a result try to boycott or not support the comeback in “protest” of it. Also, there wasn’t that many lines to start off with in the song - a lot of it is that heavily layered chorus or synths (this is a bit of stretch so I get if people disagree but I stand by my Kenzie opinion). Still, it sucks for Ricky and I do wish we heard more of his voice but he’ll get his lick back eventually. Not every member has to shine every come back and I’d still 100% rather have this song than any Feel the Pop clone even with the confusing distribution choices.",
    "reply": "a truck being sent after this cc 😭😭😭 well it definitely redirected some blame but if people want to they'll get mad at whoever and it's true not everyone gets to shine which sucks but hey im taking it over that mess any day too"
