      <p>One of my moots mentioned how kenzie usually mixes a couple / all the members vocals for chorus which is probably why loads of us heard hao/ hanbin but yeah when it came to tr you couldnâ€™t differentiate it much because of the vocal layering however it was a lot better in the live performance at the presscon</p>
