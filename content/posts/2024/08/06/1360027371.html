      <p>Thought we had relay in the bag but apparently hao was disqualified because he stepped on someone elseâ€™s line ? Went into someone elseâ€™s lane which is a big no no in relay ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I don't get it tbh cause by the mid point the runners are all basically running in the same lane and looking at this vid it doesn't seem like he went overboard with any lines??

      <p>As someone who did a lot of track this is my own knowledge and idk if this is a rule followed universally but itâ€™s a rule where Iâ€™m from but basically in relay the first runner has to stay in their lane they can only start to merge in once the second runner starts thatâ€™s why you see them all move in to the inside lane to reduce distance ran.</p>
