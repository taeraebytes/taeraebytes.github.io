 what do we make of this... like yura yura korean version yaaaaasssss but what does the rest mean. screen: zb1 remake sounds like they're recreating a film or something? maybe for the mv? or are they releasing a song that's a remake? and then the white and black seats i have no idea</p>

      <p>aahhhhh now I get why people are suspecting dtn the screen is giving a remake hint but whyre we remaking a 6 yr old twice song..... nah idt it is but I wonder what "bad romeo" and "movie in eternity" is. I think it'll be an actual song remake just not dtn

      <p>i don't get why everyone thinks it's going to be a cover of a song like yeah it's an album but it has a whole film theme, like it's literally called cinema paradise, i thought this spoiler poster saying that the screen was the zb1 remake meant that the mv would be a film remake (or would at least have film references) but apparently no one else thought that ðŸ˜­ them covering dtna doesn't make sense, other beach kpop songs i can think of like party snsd or any sistar song also don't make sense to me</p>

      <p>my first thought was a song since they hinted the Korean version of yura yura but that's makes so much more sense them doing smth similar to twice what is love remaking famous movies make the most senseeeeeeee like even if it's a song remake IT IS NOT DTNA THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME BULLSHIT
