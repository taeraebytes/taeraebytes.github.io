      <p>Just going to say this was another case of fans being too pessimistic again because a lot of other groups only had 1/2 meals but zerose got 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
Then the boys bought them ice cream too and they had goodbye gifts.
The snack bags weren’t even small either like they had loads of full size snacks in hand picked by the members which is probably why the first meal was a bit lighter. Because there was still 2 snack bags and a full meal coming.</p>
