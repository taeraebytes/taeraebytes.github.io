      <p>when can we get some marple post about the actual villain aka isac and their uneven floors and plastic shit ass 'track' field that has caused so many idols to injure themselves already but no improvement has ever been made. these tracks have 50% victim rate for a reason and causes unnecessary injuries and fights but idols have no choice but to appear because if no they gonna get blacklisted....</p>
