      <p>he's had opps since episode 1 of bp it's nothing new it's just upsetting to see it happen every. single. time. I saw the fall and already knew what was gonna happen ðŸ˜‘ well everyone moved on after him and riku talked and hugged and there's more positive attention now it just sucks that two people can do the same thing and only gunwook will get dragged to hell
