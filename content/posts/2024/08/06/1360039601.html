      <p>Just going to say this was another case of fans being too pessimistic again because a lot of other groups only had 1/2 meals but zerose got 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
1 meal 
1 snack bag 
Then the boys bought them ice cream too and they had goodbye gifts.
The snack bags werenâ€™t even small either like they had loads of full size snacks in hand picked by the members which is probably why the first meal was a bit lighter. Because there was still 2 snack bags and a full meal coming.</p>
