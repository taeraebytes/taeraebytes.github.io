Just cuz i feel like hao has the skill plus a malleable tone thats well liked taeraes just as skilled but idk how he'd suit the songs hanbins lighter tone paired w this kinda song i dont know think he'd be favored and gunwooks tone is good but like when does he ever get a lot he's treated as a singer less than Matthew and Ricky soooo idk ðŸ¤” let's try not to sweat it tbh we'll see"
