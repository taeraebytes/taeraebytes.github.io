      <p>if you go into that fandom itâ€™s clear they shield those problematic guys for everything cough that recent 5p was treated as a joke and a lie
 what makes that fandom messy is unit fans always attacking and exposing the shit other units do</p>

      <p>in general ifans put up fronts acting like they don't care about dating/sex scandals then they'll just say everything's a lie cuz they can't believe that they'd do something like that it's funny but it's true the mess attracted all those people but it's mostly the troll culture they got going on it reflects in the members too
