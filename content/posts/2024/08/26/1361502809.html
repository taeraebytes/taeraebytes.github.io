      <p>Ngl I am SAUR excited and nervous? Like if somehow the title track sucks imma kms (which probably wonâ€™t happen given the fact itâ€™s Kenzie and the previews sound so good but in the worst case scenario itâ€™s somehow ass). The kms was a joke but if Iâ€™m being fr this comeback is either the ultimate redemption or a dissent into mid. So many zeroses are hanging on by a thread I PRAY this is half as good as In Bloom ðŸ˜­ so much anticipation, an actual budget, PLEASE WAKEONE WE ARW ROOTING FOR UUUUU</p>
