      <p>the song is good but i honestly don't think i can listen to it especially since ricky had no lines they're really wasting his potential I've been trying to keep the negativity away but it's all seriously becoming too much they even took his bridge this time i don't even mean to ruin the vibes but it just upsets me so much im done with this group i already was starting to lost interest in kpop in general but this sealed it I'll probably check in here and there on them but i cant sit and watch ricky get paid dust when he doesn't even lack in anything it gets depressing to watch i love zb1 but ricky brought me back into kpop and if he's not getting much i feel like i have no reason to stay here im tired nothing against the boys just fuckass wakeone</p>
