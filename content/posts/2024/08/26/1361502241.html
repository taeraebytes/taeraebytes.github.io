 thoughts on this video? honestly it made me change my perspective on how i perceive queerness in kpop i definitely need to check myself on how many western standards i put on idols and korean ppl in general. but also i didn’t really like the part where they were mad at idols for not being activists or coming out idk i don’t really expect celebrities in general (western or not) to be activists. it’s great if they are but i’m not expecting it</p>

      <p>I agree with her its also nothing shocking to me I've always kinda thought the same thing but her last point is definitely crazy because there's real consequences these celebs would face and they don't owe anyone their participation everyone's focusing too much on the last part tho it's killing me but her going on about all this as a Korean American is crazy because there's also a context she doesn't have idk she shouldn't try to base her points in westernism vs natives and make claims like she's the president of koreas queer community like ur the westerner too idk
