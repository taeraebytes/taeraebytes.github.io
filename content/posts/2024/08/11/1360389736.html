      <p>On top of losing a lot of weight, I think Gunwook got some masseter botox. He already has filler in his nose and got the inner and outter corner of his eyes done. Still, heâ€™s one of the most natural dudes in the group outside of maybe Yujin and (if you ignore the veneers) Jiwoong. I think Gyuvin and Taerae got stuff done but I cannot place the exact work (besides Taeraeâ€™s lip fillers). The rest of the members clearly have a sizable amount of work done and fillers. Hanbinâ€™s looks super natural tho and if you didnâ€™t see his predebut photos I can understand someone thinking heâ€™s 100% natural.</p>

      <p>oh yup he did it was around last year I don't think he's gotten a second round of it just cuz he's lost that much weight on top. Mmmm for a while I thought he cut his inner corners too but they pretty much look the same from when he was a kid but yea he got some kind of nose filler it was the most obvious around Feb and I was killing myself everyday cuz I didn't like it ðŸ˜­ but we had to thank god it calmed down. And for jiwoong it just depends on what you call ps cuz he's done filler and Botox a bunch and yujin too he's just gotten a dermal filler in his nose I think maybe lips? idk but they're the least while yea for taerae and gyuvin I just don't know what exactly. I feel like also people just think Ricky's got a lot done but he really hasn't. Hanbins work is rlllyyyy good for the amt like you can't tell except for his side profile the nose slopes just unnatural

      <p>gunwook yujin and ricky are the most natural in the group, nothing invasive and even jiwoong I'd say. Those four just play with fillers once or twice and jiwoong botox (it's obv cause he can't really move his face esp in the eye area ðŸ˜­) . The rest got some invasive plastic surgery and it's obvious and they look good.

and to add to ricky I really hard agree, he's the most misunderstood idols imo because I was one of those people who used to think he got his whole face done like his nose, jaw and eyes but it's really all bones, his features grew in and his eyes were always big. I think for ricky the more you see him esp without heavy makeup the more you'll realize he's honestly really natural just because of how 'imperfect' his features are, bumpy nose bridge and long jaw with visible strong mandible bone and his eye line fluctuates depending if he's wearing eye tape to make it higher etc.</p>

      <p>Pretty much but jiwoong needs to stay calm off that Botox forever that's when he starts to look crazy... but yea with Ricky it's not anything invasive that ive noticed his family shares his unique looks and his prominent features are so obviously bone
