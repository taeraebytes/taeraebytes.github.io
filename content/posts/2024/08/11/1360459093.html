      <p>I mean is it solo overseas schedules? a group thing is different it's similar to how all their Japanese stuff gets posted on the japan twitter account idk if they've posted unique things for their Chinese group schedules on weibo just cuz I don't check

      <p>Idk if I can articulate this well but it Actually it makes a lot of sense. From what I can see they donâ€™t post non-china schedules on Weibo e.g fansigns or events they go to but they do post that on twitter. The zb1 Weibo is just members post being cross posted and uodates of their yt content but nothing for the non-China events they attend. To me this is because internationally X is one of the most used platforms however China has its own dedicated social media platform which is Weibo and more c fans are using Weibo than they are X so it makes sense to update for Chinese schedules on chinas main platform.</p>

      <p>Yea that's what came to mind it's like how all their Japanese updates are posted on their japan acc they do cross post sometimes on the main twt but it's something most groups do im not rlly surprised

      <p>The point is, aren't chinese fans also ZB1's fans who wanted to see what the boys are doing outside china? the same with international fans who wanted to see what the boys are doing in china? this isn't about platforms. this is obviously discrimination and treating china as if it's another planet which is sad because chinese fans contribute a lot</p>

      <p>I'm not sure what to say it's just a common thing in kpop most groups will only post on weibo when it's related to china and use the respective twitters for everything else. It's just a sad fact most weibos are left empty or they don't even exist in the first place but it's not like impossible to see either things consistently get cross posted by fans

      <p>Original anon I feel you missed my point. Yes Chinese fans are zb1 fans my whole point was they upload the schedule pics onto Weibo because Weibo is chinas biggest platform in comparison to twt. So to them it must make sense to upload the Chinese schedules there. The same way none of the Japan schedules get uploaded to the groups main x account but rather to zb1 Japan</p>

      <p>japan account and zb1 official account are both in x btw and everyone in x can see them ðŸ˜­it's not like there's a big wall between japan x account and the official ðŸ˜­
but there's a big firewall between Weibo and twitter. what is the problem if they post a zb1 member's china activities in X? And what is the problem if they post non-china activities in weibo as long as they're not offensive?</p>

      <p>Maybe cuz x is blocked in China ðŸ˜­???????? How are you so up in arms and don't even know that there's a reason there's no such thing as an official China x account for any kpop group ever
