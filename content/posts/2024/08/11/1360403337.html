      <p>I think it was him embarrassing her in front of matthew or her being too nervous in front of him and then her locking herself up in her room while they were in the house something like that</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure his kfans call him out on that all the time and one of the things they hate about him the most, they create twt burners and spam his bbl / mnet telling him to stop talking about other peoples business like it's his own because it's rude and how just because those people shared something with him in private doesn't mean he should share it with us so I'm surprised he still does it</p>
