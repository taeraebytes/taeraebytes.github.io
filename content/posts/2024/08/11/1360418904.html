      <p>Do you think it's right for a person called an artist manager to mock a fan who he pushed down and see his injured knee and torn off shoe? Moreover, how can you make an object of ridicule in front of many people by pointing a finger at the artist as if to ask him to look at that?

Today, I went to the airport with my camera to take pictures of my arrival. Fans filmed in a way that did not cause any harm to the artist, and instead, CC and the manager came and pushed fans who were far away first.

He had no choice but to push the fan, who had gotten closer to the manager rather than the artist, to the point where he was pushed hard by people behind him, uttering abusive language such as "Have you turned your head?"

Because I had to film with a camera, when I fell, I couldn't even reach the manager and was filming from a distance. However, SQ approached the people who were not involved, including me, and pushed hard, causing three people, including me, to fall. In the process, my knees were scraped and my shoes came off.

As you can see from the video, I stood still and filmed without moving. But the manager hit the artist, pointed at my shoes, and looked at me as if I was pitiful. And not just once, but several times, not to the airport manager but to the airport staff behind him.

How can you point a finger at a person who got hurt and had his shoes ripped off by you, and even mock the artist? I hope there will be no victims like me in the future.

I wrote this today with the hope that the artist will not be criticized, and that such damage will not occurred again. Please don't criticize the artist.

There are people who are criticizing the artist for staying still, but I think keeping quiet was the best response in that situation, and I think it was more dangerous to take other actions in a situation where there were many cameras.</p>
