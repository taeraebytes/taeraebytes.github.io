      <p>On top of losing a lot of weight, I think Gunwook got some masseter botox. He already has filler in his nose and got the inner and outter corner of his eyes done. Still, heâ€™s one of the most natural dudes in the group outside of maybe Yujin and (if you ignore the veneers) Jiwoong. I think Gyuvin and Taerae got stuff done but I cannot place the exact work (besides Taeraeâ€™s lip fillers). The rest of the members clearly have a sizable amount of work done and fillers. Hanbinâ€™s looks super natural tho and if you didnâ€™t see his predebut photos I can understand someone thinking heâ€™s 100% natural.</p>

      <p>oh yup he did it was around last year I don't think he's gotten a second round of it just cuz he's lost that much weight on top. Mmmm for a while I thought he cut his inner corners too but they pretty much look the same from when he was a kid but yea he got some kind of nose filler it was the most obvious around Feb and I was killing myself everyday cuz I didn't like it ðŸ˜­ but we had to thank god it calmed down. And for jiwoong it just depends on what you call ps cuz he's done filler and Botox a bunch and yujin too he's just gotten a dermal filler in his nose I think maybe lips? idk but they're the least while yea for taerae and gyuvin I just don't know what exactly. I feel like also people just think Ricky's got a lot done but he really hasn't. Hanbins work is rlllyyyy good for the amt like you can't tell except for his side profile the nose slopes just unnatural

      <p>yea he did it's cuz massater Botox isn't something you'd notice immediately it's like one of the most common procedures out there. it's pretty much freezing the muscles in the edge of your jaw so it goes through muscle dystrophy and that part of your face slims down I've considered getting it too ngl

      <p>It's speculation like we don't actually know just cuz his rapid weight loss makes it hard to tell but it's just a thought I've had since late last yr I'm glad it's temporary tho cuz I want him to gain weight so bad and get some of that fat back ðŸ˜£
