      <p>heâ€™s so funny itâ€™s like doing ONE episode of music core without creating a micro scandal was too much pressure for him to handle he just had to go live afterwards and air out his familyâ€™s business to relieve the stress. Imagine what heâ€™s gonna be saying by week 5
gyuvin in 5 weeks: haha guys so SULLYOON SAID â€¦.</p>
