    "reply": "I think we also forget half the group debuted as teens so theyre gonna look different no matter what AND YUP TJEYRE ALL ON OZEMPIC for Ricky his weight loss was at its height in crush I think but he's gained it's just not showing in his face cuz he probably lost baby fat im sure whatever he does in the gym is also a factor but yea. I think it's just them losing so much weight that makes them look different I think as a group they look better but they just looked so young and baby like back then"
