      <p>Same anon that talked about the masseter Botox - yeah, Ricky honestly hasnâ€™t had much. I think itâ€™s just the large sums of filler and swelling he has that makes it seem more drastic than what it is. I recently rewatched his young and rich tall and handsome video and he looks SO good there. I get the aesthetic he wants but man, what a face he had back then without the swelling</p>
