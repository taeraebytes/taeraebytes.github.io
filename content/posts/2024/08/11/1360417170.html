    "question": "sorry for this random discussion but as you live in a western country, what are your thoughts on the rising red wing incel manosphere circle? to me it just makes me think about how gullible young men are, and how easily they fall into violence towards women over NOTHING. mind you feminism talks about real life-or-death concerning issues, misogyny, femicide, double standards faced in work places, while on the other hand, the thing that turns these incels into psychopatic murderers is solely because they feel lonely? theyâ€™re fucking menaces who label and belittle women as the worst the moment a woman breathes a little wrong. men are seriously psychopaths.. sorry i need to vent ðŸ˜ž",
    "reply": "it feels like a cycle it's such a huge difference compared to a few years ago and kind of like the revival of the incel right wing YouTube era of the early 2000s-2010s. Just this time a lot more violent but yea I find it pretty scary because no matter how much you raise a boy a couple of online presences or even in person could change them. Everytime I think about this I also think about how x has become an incel right wing breeding ground and everything people tried to fight against is just coming back. But I feel you it makes me feel hopeless ugh I don't even wanna think about what the next few years might look like"
