      <p>Megaquake is weird cuz there's no definite date like August 21 or something, scientist just know it's gonna happen but dunno when so it could be tmrw, next week, next month, next year or next decade we just don't know but just know it's gonna big big and that's just unnecessary anxiety if I were Japanese ðŸ˜­ like damn living in fear for who knows how long until it happens</p>
