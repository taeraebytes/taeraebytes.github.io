      <p>i thought this too (about hao as well) and then i realised it was their choreographer/dance teachers/dance friends like they were dancing to tinashe, charli, yaeji, beyonce etc etc but if you look at the stuff they're actually into then you realise those songs weren't up to them LMAO like hao listens to every kpop song ever and adele and hanbin listens to nct, korean indie and whatever more generic pop koreans like and while some of it is fine lots of it isn't really my vibe ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Yea I was gonna say like from what I see hanbin wouldn't listen to Charli on his own im sure they've seen the trends in turn being exposed to it but like it was definitely not themselves ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>For Hanbin I saw the video a long time ago and it was a choreo made by himself so he picked the song but Hao western music taste fell off to me when he said Adele, I like her songs but cmon...</p>
