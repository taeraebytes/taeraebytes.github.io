      <p>I've reached the stage where I borderline dislike my bias but I have a hard time leaving the fandom because I've grown attached and stanning him as become one of my main hobbies, I wanna say I'll leave of this comeback will leave me disatisfied but I genuinely don't know what else to do like I like drawing and writing but all of my hobbies have been centered around my stanning experience for over a year, most of my friends are stand too

You don't have to reply or read as I know negativity can be exhausting I just wanted to vent lol</p>

      <p>I'm not saying this to be snarky but for you or anyone who has this relationship with stanning you should try improving your intellectual life. No lie, i like kpop (cleary, since i'm here) but at its core its a completely brainless emotionally unfulfilling mental preoccupation without communal or otherwise energizing activities (e.g. dance, fashion, socializing at meet ups or concerts, etc.) to go along with it. drawing and writing are great solitary hobbies but if all your creative inspo is routed in kpop, you should try decentering kpop from your creative endeavors bc if you do eventually unstan that can hurt your drive to draw and write. maybe explore tangentially related media as a starting point such as korean art/literature or culture/art criticism (everyone should read susan sontag in their lifetime) or idk the sight and sound best film list. expand your creative horizons.

also this is tangential but as someone who had left kpop for a while and came back for bp/zb1, their short contract was actually a huge draw and reason for me to stick around thus far LOL. i was like yeah, i can do 2.5 years of semi-active stanning as supplementation to my more substantial hobbies, then more passively follow my bias post-disbandment. It's possible to strike a good balance if thats what you want üëç</p>

      <p>yea like there needs to be balance and just awareness of what you're really into you can't allow for your life to be consumed. Even though I run an active kpop cc I rlly try not to let it affect my general enjoyment or even what I do outside of it it's possible im sorry you feel that way but hopefully it gets better
