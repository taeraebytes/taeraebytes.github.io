      <p>Since the Suga DUI brought out insane fans I wanted to ask yâ€™all: what would you do if your fave did the same thing? Personally Iâ€™d cry because Iâ€™d expect better and then burn all their photo cards and make a donation in their name to a cult so theyâ€™d get constant mails or messages asking for more. Then Iâ€™d become a certified hater and troll them out of anger of disappointment. What about yâ€™all?</p>
