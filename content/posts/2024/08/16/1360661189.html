The only album I bought was YITS. I don't follow ZB1 much because the fanwars were crazy from the start and I don't expose myself to online nonsense, but I'm here because they have a comeback but I've seen zerose hype up everyone except Hao and most tweets I see about him are him being Gay (like he could just laugh and the comments will only be about him being a twink), or am I just on the wrong side of twitter, I always tune in for come backs and dip, but nothing seems to change when I return for the next comeback.",
