      <p>Hi! I'm that briize anon, sad to inform and disappoint you after your advice but I made a zb1 stan twt acc ðŸ˜­ 

I couldn't help it and I just wanted to separate my riize tl from zb1 tl and avoid negativity because some of my briize moots are anti zb1 ðŸ’€ so far I'm just retweeting content so it's been really fun</p>

      <p>hcjdjgnmfkdkkd noooooooooo it's ok my advice is just for the extreme cases where you're deeply involved to the point of constantly taking heat and just spiraling into negativity. I think making a socmed acc for kpop is fun and I still partake in it it just gets annoying but I hope your experience goes wellllllllll. I'm sure you could even make mutuals if you want to just surround urself w positive fans and ur good im excited for you yass

      <p>Idk about the Korean fandom but the intl fandom definitely decreased I'm not gonna judge since I'm a zb1 fan we lost a good chunk but I think it's because through tiktok you'd think they're these fun trendy young adults and then you watch riize content and it's like imagine daechinso if it were 5 sohee plus the music is really mid</p>

      <p>another anon and not sure about the percentage but I just know a good chunk of k riize fans slowly left for tws and wish and this started during that one daechinso live they got criticized for where it was all members of riize and jaehyun but jaehyun did all the talking and promoting for riize comeback ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>omgggg I noticed this half of the nasty wish fans who were bullying gunwook were ex briizes ðŸ˜‘ idk if it's because of that but definitely those fans left to those groups but like they're also ex zeroses it's crazy how every fandom will always just be filled with old zb1 fans
