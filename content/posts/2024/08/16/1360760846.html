      <p>i sent the previous ask and i actually really like rbb, imo bad boy was too good that's why rbb didn't get the recognition they deserved. also i would not mind a rbb type of song from lsfm but they would need a wendy type of voiceÂ </p>

      <p>I meant the concept pictures, LSF song it's not out yet so I wasn't talking about the songs. The RBB mini is good, people just disliked it bc they thought they were getting a more r&b song which wasn't the case.</p>
