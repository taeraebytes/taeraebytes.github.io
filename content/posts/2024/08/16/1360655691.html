      <p>I feel like this cb will be the last test for a lot of us, like depending on how it goes the fandom could turn around positively or negatively, I know a lot of my moots both solos and group stans are kinda just exhausted and ready to jump ship, me included, I just hope they do the best they canðŸ¤§

I'm sorry for the negativity I'm just depressed that so far the highlighted people for this CB are gyuvin and jiwoong like I'm really losing hope now</p>
