      <p>Seriously tho. Hybe's crisis manager is good. They waited for the worst to come out them release their alas and voila! Thr focus is now on the lies spread by the media, not the dui that actually happened because i'm pretty sure, they already have that video since day 1. This is why i'm somehow amazed that crazy mhj is able to make a dent on hybe</p>

      <p>They're really so smart for taking a step back. They did try to get on it while it was fresh they got backlash but now they have a narrative to push like zamn. But it's not gonna rlly do anything to change people's minds the dui and the bj stuff is irreversible
