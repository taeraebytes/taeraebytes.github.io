      <p>Hi! I'm that briize anon, sad to inform and disappoint you after your advice but I made a zb1 stan twt acc ðŸ˜­ 

I couldn't help it and I just wanted to separate my riize tl from zb1 tl and avoid negativity because some of my briize moots are anti zb1 ðŸ’€ so far I'm just retweeting content so it's been really fun</p>

      <p>hcjdjgnmfkdkkd noooooooooo it's ok my advice is just for the extreme cases where you're deeply involved to the point of constantly taking heat and just spiraling into negativity. I think making a socmed acc for kpop is fun and I still partake in it it just gets annoying but I hope your experience goes wellllllllll. I'm sure you could even make mutuals if you want to just surround urself w positive fans and ur good im excited for you yass
