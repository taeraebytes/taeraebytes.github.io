      <p>Question: I'm new to this cc and cc in general. Why do Zerose ot9 seem to hate/dislike Hao so bad? They call him try hard, angry, big nose, and all sorts of names. I think he's sweet and very genuine, I was rooting for him on Boys planet but I don't like ZB1 music except crush and a couple of others songs, I don't like cutsey music but Yura Yura is nice so I'm not really a die hard fan. The only album I bought was YITS. I don't follow ZB1 much because the fanwars were crazy from the start and I don't expose myself to online nonsense, but I'm here because they have a comeback but I've seen zerose hype up everyone except Hao and most tweets I see about him are him being Gay (like he could just laugh and the comments will only be about him being a twink), or am I just on the wrong side of twitter, I always tune in for come backs and dip, but nothing seems to change when I return for the next comeback.</p>
