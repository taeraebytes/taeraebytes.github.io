      <p>oh damn I just checked his tag and I didn't see anything i wonder why his fansites weren't there but I'm just assuming he was present it looks like a full group thing

      <p>a lot of rickys most active fansites these days are really new like just opened a couple months ago so they donâ€™t have connections even ones like meowmeowpunch opened during debut era so there arenâ€™t rlly any ricky fansites in the predebut cliques</p>

      <p>ohhhhhhhhhh okay that makes sense because a lot of these fansites are old and their cliques are old dang miskeen nobody wanna help the fresh new rukidans out ðŸ˜­? I do think it's also staff info just as much as it is the cliques finding out so they should find connections too ig
