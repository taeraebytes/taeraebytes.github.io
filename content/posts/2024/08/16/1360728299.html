      <p>I'm giving 10s for the whole thing like idc we ain never had it this good 

But I guess here's my order I rlly do like everything rating was kinda hard

Gunwook: we made the comeback of a century.. he went from the worst concept photo to the best one WE NEEDED THAT SO BAD
Ricky: loveeeee his styling he looks rlly good 
Matthew: I like his styling too he looks cute
Hao: he looks cute in the second photo I like the background in his first pic just a good shot 
Hanbin: cute shot looks good
Taerae: same for taerae cute shot I like his fit for him hao and hanbin I don't rlly have much to say cuz there's nothing I dislike about their photos but also not my favorites theyre rlly cute shots tho 
Yujin: love his teaser pics but idk if I'm really rocking with that voidy first pic maybe I'll grow to like it and bump him up 
Jiwoong: his first shot isn't all that interesting 
Gyuvin: his teaser isn't bad I just don't like how he has the bubble in both pics like they could've changed that up and it just puts him last for me
