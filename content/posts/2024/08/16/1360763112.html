      <p>Hi! I'm that briize anon, sad to inform and disappoint you after your advice but I made a zb1 stan twt acc 😭 

I couldn't help it and I just wanted to separate my riize tl from zb1 tl and avoid negativity because some of my briize moots are anti zb1 💀 so far I'm just retweeting content so it's been really fun</p>

      <p>hcjdjgnmfkdkkd noooooooooo it's ok my advice is just for the extreme cases where you're deeply involved to the point of constantly taking heat and just spiraling into negativity. I think making a socmed acc for kpop is fun and I still partake in it it just gets annoying but I hope your experience goes wellllllllll. I'm sure you could even make mutuals if you want to just surround urself w positive fans and ur good im excited for you yass

      <p>Idk about the Korean fandom but the intl fandom definitely decreased I'm not gonna judge since I'm a zb1 fan we lost a good chunk but I think it's because through tiktok you'd think they're these fun trendy young adults and then you watch riize content and it's like imagine daechinso if it were 5 sohee plus the music is really mid</p>
