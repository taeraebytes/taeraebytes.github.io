      <p>I mean it was 45 seconds long and I only heard them so like that's a good third of the song I think it might be just them. But there's been no like article or anything stating it's them so we'll see

      <p>I would agree but then I remembered how IOI OST (Also given by mnet ofc) would be chungha and yeonjung singing for at least 40 seconds and then Somi with like 18 seconds and then some random members with 8 seconds.</p>

      <p>There's one on where it was only 6 IOI members for the OST and the line distribution was like one member with 1 minute and 20 seconds, another one with 40 seconds, and then the other 4 with like 10 seconds each. It was funny as hell.</p>
