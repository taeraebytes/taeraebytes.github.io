      <p>Yeah me too I'm an OG but I'm kinda at wits end like things feel helpless and at least before the stress kinda made you desperate but now it's just kinda like ehh whatever akgaes also ruin the group for me, but I hope the tour brings the excitement back, I was super happy during the Japanese fancon</p>
