      <p>sorry for the rant i just want to get this off my chest but being a ricky stan is seriously so poverty because we all live off fansite pictures and pluschat messages and posts from months ago or from last year because he's never active ik this is so random but i just get this realization every month and im like why am i still here there's really nothing going on for him ever but i just truly vibe with the group a lot and I like him a lot too to just up and leave him and act like he doesn't exist to me but damn ts depressing AF like I used to be a firm believer that wakeone was restricting him from interacting with his fans and posting but even jiwoong interacts after that whole disappearance he had for a few months which i only knew about bc his fans were spamming tf out of their comments about it and now I'm just like damn i guess ricky truly doesn't want or have anything to post or say at all like idk it just racks my brain a lot because he used to be pretty active here and there especially on their twitter account but it just all stopped around november a few weeks after the manager thing and its so weird to me but whatever at the end of the day I'm never leaving no matter what lmaoooo but anyways on a happier note lately I've been gunwook biased a lot like he's seriously so cute, witty, and talented i used to be all about shimkongz but riwook has tooken that place now 😂❤️ they're so adorable together I need a schedule with both of them like right nowwww</p>

      <p>icl I be feeling bad for yall he doing you like jaehyun I thought he'd have a little more consistency after gyuvin told him to get on bubble but he gave up again 😭😭 he's honestly an interesting dude and I rlly like him too but he's also predictable I feel like he was always gonna be this type but maybe he's just busier rn I feel like everyone's kinda gone inactive for the past few weeks cuz of cb prep maybe yall need more kfans and cfans jumping him and he'll get it together. but he's so hype in other areas yea he just needs to force the socmed aspect ig but yassss gunwooks such a fun guy to follow icl he's been a little inactive too for his standards they're all busy hopefully it picks back up but im dying for a riwook schedule tooooo 😆😆😆😆 I love their dynamic so much like please THIS IS WORTH AN INVESTMENT

      <p>gurl im telling you as a friend with mannnyyyy happy riyangis i suggest u unfollow yejigf and their hashtag 'let ricky posts!' minions or accs similar to them cuz theyre doing more damage than good cuz its clear as day ricky is just the type to spam post once a month on social media and theres nothing wrong with that. the whole 'he used to go on bbl so much' was once a week and thats basically what he does now. like my riyangi moots always rant to me how these loud ass 'riyangi's' aka yejigf think theyre protecting him but in reality they dont know him at all and instead theyre tryna push this image of who they want him to be aka this social media addict dude that updates his every hour and location 😭😭😭😭😭😭 atp u think ur blaming 'mistreatment' and 'wakeone' but in reality u just hate him and his character... he obviously cherishes his private time and prefers to keep private things... private 😭 like if not for the random fan sighting and gyuvin we wouldnt even know he went out to eat with gyuvin in LA.

idk i love ricky he'll always be my top 3 and top reason is his unique personality like did u guys not read his magazine interview about how hes open to and will listen to ppl opinions and suggestions but if it's not what he stands by even if its 9/10 ppl disagreeing with him and telling him to not do this or do that if it aint what he believes in and wants than he doesnt give a fuck. he even said its one of his flaws yet he still stands by it because hes stubborn and its what makes him him so idk what else to tell u other than what i just said 😭 like my riyangi moots never loved him more ever since they accepted him for who he is like duh no shit they wish hed posts more because they love him and want to see more of him but thats why when he does share something they cherish that shit like they still talking to me about his chicken bones and glad hes eating good 😭</p>

      <p>1000000000% omg these people will just ruin ur time bruh I feel like it's so obvious this is just how Ricky moves he gives the vibes like him taking so much time to make videos and all that really him. And I thought so too like I didn't think he was thattt active before I think that's just what people think. Like zamn he rlly does keep everything to himself we hear about him more from the other members than him saying the stories. He's cool people he'll always be one of the members I genuinely like in the group I loved that interview I always felt weird whenever people would try to type him as someone with no autonomy. I do understand anon tho like it would be nice to get more of someone you cherish the fan idol relationship relies on this kinda stuff and the lack of content makes it worse but also it's good to keep in mind nobody's rlly active rn but yea it's easier when u realize this is just Ricky as a person I can respect it
