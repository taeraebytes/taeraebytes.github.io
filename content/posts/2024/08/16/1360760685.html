      <p>i feel like zb1 look decent surgery wise like yeah there have been complaints here and there (won't be listing them but iykyk) but generally they're good like some idols truly have it bad. i just hope none of them, or their companies in the future, decide to go trigger happy and botch themselves bc they look pretty fine now</p>
