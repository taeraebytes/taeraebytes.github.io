      <p>not literally saying they want a solo fanmeet in korea though I'm sure a small bunch do it's just any gig he gets in china is immediately met with "oh but they could never do this for him in korea"

      <p>I never get it when they say that tho because itâ€™s not like anyone else has gotten what heâ€™s got in China in KR ðŸ˜­ like itâ€™s not like the other members are getting similar brand opportunities and itâ€™s just him being skipped over in kr</p>
