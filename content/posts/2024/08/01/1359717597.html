      <p>i saw someone calling koreans superstitionus and remember something from that weibo melon account, i don't think it is true but apparently one night hanbin saw someone in the dorm but that member was not there that night and the comments were talking about how the next comeback is going to be huge since they associate seeing something paranormal with success.</p>

      <p>Hanbin did say it. It looked like he was also hoping for them to do well after saying that ghost thing. But I don't remember if it was before ftp because if it is then it makes no sense</p>

      <p>No actually he was being hopeful. The whole group was begging for success during ftp and sweat. They really wanted to do well. He said about the ghost story because of that superstition not because he saw ghost and got scared or something.</p>
