      <p>donâ€™t idols usually wear hanboka on chuseok? that would be nice to see but I am not certain if it would be ok for the global members, like I think Matthew would get a pass but cline might have their cfans mad at them idkâ€¦ but it would be cute to see</p>

      <p>matthews Korean that's his culture ðŸ˜­ hao everyone already knows he's a kboo and most of Ricky's fans aren't Chinese plus it's less worth it to have the entire kfanbase angry plus nationalist Koreans that'll drag them to hell and back their cfans won't be as upset at them if they participate

      <p>yeah ik but idk if koreans are okay with that 100% as they do not really consider him korean for the cline members I think it might cause one of these debates the koreans and chinese have about the garments always, cfans might start tweaking about wanting to see them on their own Chinese garments too, kfans might be okay but maybe kantis and trolls will drag them for itâ€¦</p>

      <p>yea that's in the sense that he's not native he's recognized as a diaspora korean so why would he have a restriction on celebrating his own culture ðŸ˜­?? but the least amount of damage would be them just doing chuseok stuff idk if hanboks are required but they promote and live in korea with a majority Korean group so that would fair best imo
