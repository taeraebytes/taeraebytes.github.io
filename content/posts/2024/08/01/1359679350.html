      <p>People are actually highly speculating that this should have been yhmah era but then max offered a song and wakeone didnâ€™t wanna say no so they quickly put together a comeback around ftp which would explain why the members knew literally nothing about what was going on</p>

      <p>mmmm no that makes no sense they definitely did not have this concept in mind when they recorded yhamh which was around dec last yr we just got a mediocre song with no vision and sadly it was intended but they've changed now esp with the merge and staffing. Plus max wasn't the main producer for ftp I don't think
