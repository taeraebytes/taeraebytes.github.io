      <p>People are mad like I’m seeing loads of ot9 pissed at wakeone because the comeback is the 26th they will promote for 2/3 weeks straight and go fly to La for 2 days in the middle of that, miss chuseok and then only have 2 days rest (if they aren’t promoting for the 3rd week) before the tour kicks off</p>
