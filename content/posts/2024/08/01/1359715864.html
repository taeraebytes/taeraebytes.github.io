      <p>Chuseok is the 16th but yeah it will be the 15th in LA I remember the first krazy was supposed to fall on chuseok too like why would they invite majority Korean artist and then schedule it for a public holiday ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they should be spending time at home with their families ( im kr and chuseok is such a nice time when family comes together and we can see everyone and catch up ect) I really canâ€™t believe wk1 agreed to send them knowing they are essentially going to spend it performing and then on a 12 hour plane ride</p>
