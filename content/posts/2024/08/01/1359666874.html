      <p>i hope if the comeback teaser/film is looking good then the mv can look good too since i feel like zb1's leave a lot to be desired üòîüôè like they're just never as engaging as other groups. i looked at their instagram and dvision seem to only do concept trailers and that sort of thing so the mv director is probably someone completely different ugh PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE</p>

      <p>I'm not gonna set any expectations but I'd assume if they did this much for the trailer similar effort will be put into the real thing. But all we can do is just wait and see what we get hopefully they snagged someone of a similar caliber
