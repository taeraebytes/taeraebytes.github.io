      <p>I just had to check cuz I thought i was crazy it only charted the first week or so and for about 1-2 hours which is pretty much the same as ftp but they charted for about 2 weeks so yes it was worse than ftp bnd have only charted for 11 hours in entirety 😭 I will say bnds ULs are better but not nearly enough to overtake they have 12 fans and on every other chart they did worse than ftp THEYRE NOT GAGGING SHIT NOT EVEN AT OUR WORST 😂✌️
