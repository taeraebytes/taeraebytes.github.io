      <p>EH??? In what universe does bnd have more kfans than zb1 they still have the most fans out of the top 3 bgs ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ sorry I've actually never heard anything crazier bnd probably have half maybe less if we're being real like if they ever did a concert they wouldn't be able to book kspo dome for even a day lolllll zb1 are just blocked from the gp unlike other bgs. like just going off streams charts sales... they not touching shit except Spotify thanks to Mr bang pd
