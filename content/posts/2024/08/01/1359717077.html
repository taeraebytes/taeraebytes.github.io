      <p>donâ€™t idols usually wear hanboka on chuseok? that would be nice to see but I am not certain if it would be ok for the global members, like I think Matthew would get a pass but cline might have their cfans mad at them idkâ€¦ but it would be cute to see</p>

      <p>matthews Korean that's his culture ðŸ˜­ hao everyone already knows he's a kboo and most of Ricky's fans aren't Chinese plus it's less worth it to have the entire kfanbase angry plus nationalist Koreans that'll drag them to hell and back their cfans won't be as upset at them if they participate
