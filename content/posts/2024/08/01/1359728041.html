      <p>This is like for next year but I just deeped that since zb1 contract finishes like really early January we probably wonâ€™t get like final cb and promo close to that date but rather in oct/nov like crush since December and a lot of Jan will be swamped with award shows. This reminds me of ioi where there last public appearance as a group was an award show and all the girls were crying when they accepted the award ðŸ˜­</p>
