      <p>i have to say im not part of the akgae crowd but while getting brand deals is great heâ€™s always been very clear in saying his passion lies with music and performing and these brand deals are literally just a way to grab cash from the fans since these brands know his fans have a massing buying power for their size and and in turn they create some sm clout for him, like itâ€™s cool that he has those but it would be nice to see him get an opportunity to do something heâ€™s actually passionate about?  like ok cute i can buy a brush with his name on it but i like him for singing and performing so idrc about the brush or a mist or whatever they want to sell with his face on the ad, so im not sure why it would calm down the akgaes who i think also want the same things for him (tbh nothing would calm them down, itâ€™s the point of being an akgae)</p>

      <p>I take anything as an opportunity and these things do allow for exposure besides the fan purchase power there's still a benefit to him but it's also not like he's the only one missing out from having activities in what he likes to do
