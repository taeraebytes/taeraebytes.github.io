      <p>sometimes its upsetting to see zeroses interact with allin akgaes that used to be so openly vile to the members even following them like did we all just collectively forget about it ðŸ˜­ but i noticed theres so many new zeroses that might know so whatever i know it shouldnt be a big deal i just have trauma seeing those accs lol</p>
