      <p>okay so from stanning Kepler Izone wanna one I'll give predictions
Because it's been over a year now they won't fully perform more than 2 songs. So there's a chance they do two units for two bps songs, but they'll have to be new so I'm not counting the final songs.
Or what is more common is to do a medley of all bp songs, this could be 5 minutes or 10 minutes long where they sing all bp songs.</p>
