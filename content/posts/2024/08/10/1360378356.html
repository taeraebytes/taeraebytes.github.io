That Chinese makeup that they do for him makes his fillers look more obvious bc they like focusing the makeup on his lips that make you look more at his lower face so you go and look at the jaw fillers. His Korean makeup is more focused on his eyes so you focus on the upper part of his face more.",

      <p>I don't understand how they say they prefer his Chinese styling, like yeah you can say that about the hair I guess bc it makes him look manlier but the makeup they do for him in korea it's way better.</p>
