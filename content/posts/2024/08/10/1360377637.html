      <p>huh? i swear everyone says wanna one's music is terrible so wdym....... or do u mean mixing/quality wise, like even if the song is 'bad' it sounds layered and as if their voices aren't drowning or autotuned to the max or whatever ðŸ˜­ i've only listened to a few of their title tracks and energetic was the only one that stuck so i'm unfamiliar with them</p>
