      <p>Gunwooks picture is actually hilarious shsjekiskebdjd like what was the vision I actually giggle everytime I see it
Hariboz face cards really ate Ricky usally kill these face shoots and I've been liking his looks the most with the black but it's one of the rarer good teaser pics for Hao, the shot is uninteresting but his styling is amazing let's keep the dark styling jebal
I get the vision but like not even a filter really?????? If they added a little filter and played with the saturation it would've ate
Matthew looks like an IG pic
Hanbin and Yujin looks like candids you'd delete immediately and hanbins makeup isn't good
Taerae looks scary</p>

I think hao has the best comp his shot looks the most like a concept photo Ricky's was nice 
matthews looks so mid i don't even rlly have thoughts
yujins would've been saved if it wasn't for the background
And hanbins is a press photo
