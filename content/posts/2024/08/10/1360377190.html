      <p>Sorry sent early on accident rosins make me cringe so bad sorry everyone knows hao is queer people are gonna call a spade a spade if you're gonna tweak so bad everytime someone correctly says something he did is queer leaning literally just Stan any other idolü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èyes being semi openly queer predebut and not really hiding is gonna be a center piece to who he is as a person because it's not something that is usually seen in kpop idols, either get over it and leave
Also the Indo rosins trying to gaslight Chinese speakers.. nothing cringier (as a Chinese person who's not a fan of him)</p>

      <p>I can see both sides to the argument and it's just the fact that there's two extremes no middle ground
