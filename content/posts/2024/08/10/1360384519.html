      <p>it's actually funny to think that bang pd's sighting with those bjs is deliberate to save suga and divert the attention to him but it did nothing except making mhj the good guy again</p>

      <p>He also really dgaf because I know that he probably was not expecting getting caught but also he has the money to go everywhere with a car, while LA is also not a super walkable city and yet he still had those girlies dressed up from head to toe walking with him in west hollywood ðŸ˜­ I don't know if he even knows this but those amateur paparazzis that don't receive pap walk requests are usually in places like west hollywood taking pics of everyone that looks like an influencer to see if he can at least get some cash out of it.</p>
