      <p>i just saw the concept pics and omg they're terrible ðŸ˜­ but since they give off the same vibe as the comeback trailer (they literally just look like the behind the scenes photos that wakeone post for photoshoots) i'm hoping that the others which we have no point of reference for are of higher quality and actually look like a photoshoot otherwise uhhhhhhh</p>
