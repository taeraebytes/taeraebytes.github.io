    "reply": "oh yup he did it was around last year I don't think he's gotten a second round of it just cuz he's lost that much weight on top. Mmmm for a while I thought he cut his inner corners too but they pretty much look the same from when he was a kid but yea he got some kind of nose filler it was the most obvious around Feb and I was killing myself everyday cuz I didn't like it ðŸ˜­ but we had to thank god it calmed down. And for jiwoong it just depends on what you call ps cuz he's done filler and Botox a bunch and yujin too he's just gotten a dermal filler in his nose I think maybe lips? idk but they're the least while yea for taerae and gyuvin I just don't know what exactly. I feel like also people just think Ricky's got a lot done but he really hasn't. Hanbins work is rlllyyyy good for the amt like you can't tell except for his side profile the nose slopes just unnatural"
