      <p>like this is the 3rd time sm artists release at the exact same time as zb1 GO BE SOMEBODY!!!!!!!! I'm sorry if it happens a 4th time it's just not a coincidence mi NUH care but like I'm not too worried ab jaehyun his style of music is a miss in korea plus he'd probably only have digitals over us
