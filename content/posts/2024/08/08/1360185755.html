      <p>BP ended so long ago but like ngl Ampersandone is really the second best group to come out of it. Like even if I don’t follow them closely kamden is just a dude and a funny one at that and the rest of the members seem chill af. They might not be revolutionary talented but their songs are mediocre fun you can enjoy (aka no EVNNE Get Ugly terrible music). I’ve also never seen someone genuinely hate on Kamden outside of his dad trying to ruin his career and like the tiktoks with his even more awkward twin are funny af</p>
