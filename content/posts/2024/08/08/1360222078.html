      <p>one thing i'm kinda worried about is the MV, people really underestimate what a good MV with a replay value can do to make a song more popular like the crush and ftp MVs were straight shit from butt ugh, please have a cohesive storyline and a nice video that matches the vibe of the song but i'm getting good vibes from the bad trailer and i'm hoping that's kinda the overall theme of it</p>

      <p>me too I'm still rlly holding my breath about that I'm thankful we got such a good team for the trailer but I'm not moving till I see who they got for the mv though I don't think it would crush/ftp level. But same I have good feelings about it just not gonna expect anything

      <p>diff anon and omg i was about to send an ask about my personal worry for the comeback and just saw this lmao yeah i guess the mv is one thing to worry about... i was actually gonna say that the creative aspect has been so good this time around like yujin hyping up the choreo, hanbin saying he likes their recording better than the demo, really good producers, decent graphic design, comeback trailer with interesting concept so i'm not too worried about the mv (tho i won't be surprised if it isn't the greatest). what i'm actually worried about is the promo like it seems the product (aka music and visuals) is good but what about promo to get the word out like what shows are they gonna go on, what exactly are they gonna do. i feel like this stuff causes lots of fandom infighting with the mistreatment olympics but it is also a genuine worry bc last era promos didn't seem the best iirc? and idek how much time they have for this era since they're so busy like i'm already scared and annoyed in advance for whatever promos are LMAO</p>

      <p>That's my biggest thing like I know how an amazing mv can do wonders for a song but for us if its mid people can ignore I just hope they're being used and abused for good promo... all that filming they did HOE WE WANT A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT!!!!!! The ftp promos felt so weirdly put tgthr and so much of what they filmed came out too late good results depend so much on timing it's crazy. Everyone put ur hands tgthr and pray

      <p>i think timing is the most important thing as reach can be way better if theres truly no huge comebacks at the time. every cb we had to deal with this issue. but i do believe that if the final product is good and theres no outstanding issues going on in kpop, word of mouth will spread like through nonfans on tiktok and twitter. recently for bgs it happened with bite me and bouncy where usually both their fandoms had issue pushing songs out to general kpop fans (enha not so much) but they suddenly got attention on their mv, song, dance, skills and with good cb periods and gained a lot of fans</p>
