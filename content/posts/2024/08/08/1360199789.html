      <p>firstly u need to understand rosallin akgaes tag themselves so obviously as akgaes and they're the biggest ones and second jiwoongs on a pity run for intl zeroses it's so annoying. I'm surprised no big acc has said smth ab harassing the journalist but again we have duds running this fandom and one of the big accs actually attacked the journalist as well sooooo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
