      <p>I really hope that Gyuvin doesnt end up becoming the MuCore MC because no other group had three members who were MCs at the same time. Nobody needs that shit</p>

      <p>beef and hate aside 3 mcs in a temp group is a crazy decision like now we're sacrificing 3 days of the week and time

      <p>Tbh tho the mc stuff is never going to come before group stuff like hanbin and yujin will miss mcing for group stuff but will never miss group stuff for mcing but again I think considering a tour is coming up signing a contract to add another mc in isnâ€™t the best idea especially since music core is on a Saturday and most concerts are on the weekends because more people are free</p>

      <p>I know it won't come in front of stuff but it just makes scheduling a bit harder demands more useless appearances and it's just more work. Not to mention flights have to be tweaked but like yea imagine missing almost everyday for 3 months they're an active rookie group they can't have this many outside commitments
