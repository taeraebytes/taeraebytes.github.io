      <p>it's actually starting to bother me how obvious it's gotten that wakeone gives the most important stuff to visuals first and foremost? yujin and gyuvin both getting mc roles when neither are known to be great speakers or mcs? yujin getting more singing lines than taerae sometimes when he's not known as a good vocalist??? I'm sorry but this is starting to piss me off LMAOO even jiwoong got his own variety show bc he was hyped for his visuals when he was never known for his humor and personality God</p>

      <p>I feel like people forget since gyuvins microscandals ruined things but he's always been a favorite üò≠üò≠ the jiwoong show was crazy but while yujin was super unqualified for mcing he does have the popularity to back it up i can give him that but gyuvin doesn't even have a stronger core fandom or even just more clout which is crazy like NOW UR JUST BEING DISRESPECTFUL ü§¨ ugh idk ill probably get rational about this soon but its just so upsetting whateverrrrrrrrr

      <p>That only applies to big companies or like the mnet to mcountdown connection who exactly has gotten mc jobs based on companies (smaller ones that is) for a show that isn't like The Show or whatever and besides on the off chance if it is wakeone somehow it's not exclusive to them as a company that a visual or a lesser suited member is sent in fact it's very rare that the most well spoken member is sent in for a mc job it's never been about oratory skills I know everyone already knows all this and everyone's justifiably upset I just hope everyone will calm down soon gunwooks time will come inshallah</p>

      <p>imma just tell u right now gunwooks time isn't coming if it was it would've happened by now like sorry he just gets edged üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ it's not even a surprising thing either I left the perm mc dream behind months ago it's just very evident it's never happening and I was fine with it until this mixed mess... like I'm cool off gunwook doing special mcing with another member who gets gifts from the literal pd when he gets nothing and then gyuvins opportunity is announced with not even a real duo pic THEY HAD TO EDIT THE PICTURE TOGETHER AND USE GUNWOOKS FACE FOR NOOO REASON and it just had to be the show gunwook wanted to be on since 16 likeeeee alright gyuvin is rlly wearing gunwook mistreatment and erasure on his wrist rn this is crazy. The fact that mcing is chosen off visuals or whatever reason isn't new im aware this choice is definitely a crazier one considering the lack of oratory and even the skill to understand time and place but hey by some miracle he could do great he can have it tbh he's been dying for a fandom and clout and he's got it good luck Lea Michele

      <p>ik this is getting you off since it's gyuvins first time ever being important but let's be very cute im not on the same level of dud as you because clearly i stated that more than once but this is rlly the one and only thing gyuvin will ever have everything he manages to be known for is in association of someone else he's never been successful in building a name for himself and when he tried what happened? OH HE NERFED HIS OWN FANDOM LOL I rlly hope you pray over him and that he somehow wakes up with a functioning enough brain to not make grade school level idiot mistakes on broadcasted tv but ofc ill enjoy the whiteboard its not like gyuvins ever gone viral or made any kind of significant impact you wouldn't know what that feels like üòÇ‚úåÔ∏è good day to the both of you tho and enjoy this block too whore
