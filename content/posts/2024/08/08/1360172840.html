    "question": "one thing i'm kinda worried about is the MV, people really underestimate what a good MV with a replay value can do to make a song more popular like the crush and ftp MVs were straight shit from butt ugh, please have a cohesive storyline and a nice video that matches the vibe of the song but i'm getting good vibes from the bad trailer and i'm hoping that's kinda the overall theme of it",
    "reply": "me too I'm still rlly holding my breath about that I'm thankful we got such a good team for the trailer but I'm not moving till I see who they got for the mv though I don't think it would crush/ftp level. But same I have good feelings about it just not gonna expect anything"
