      <p>I’d laugh my ass off if Jihoon is a better tutter than Hanbin because his fanbase would lose 80% of their identity. “THE BEST TUTTER EVER!” “#1 MAIN DANCER” “ONLY PROFESSIONAL QUEER STYLE MALE DANCER!!!” They’d all cry in unison in some vapid attempt at defensiveness and protection over a man that will never know they exist. I feel like Hanbin has been put on a pedestal and while I do believe he genuinely means a lot for future queer idols and representation, at the end of the day tutting and waacking and ballroom are just some of the many styles of dances in the world. While Hanbin does mean a lot for representation, his speciality doesn’t inherently have more worth than to say those that specialize in krumping.</p>

      <p>It would be surprising since he's so closely associated with it and given the title but honestly it isn't too crazy to here kpop fans will rlly just hype their idols up to be the best at anything even if they're not. It's just crazy to me how much people have made it an identity marker for him

      <p>This is why gyuvin got that mc gig and not gunwook because y'all want to speak on other members talents and want to speculate (not even saying with proof) how other group idols are better than him just because you don't like him. And I don't even understand this type of obsession and hatred where he didn't even have to do anything but you want to make something he really treasures look normal and uninteresting. At least gunwook said hanbin is really talented and that there is a lot to unpack about his talents. Maybe be nice to good people and hope for good things to happen to gunwook instead. This pissed me off even more because there are actual retarded rosin antis in weibo saying jihoon is better because he looks like a man dancing but hanbin wants to do it like women or something. I hope you know you are entertaining the opinion of homophobic people</p>
