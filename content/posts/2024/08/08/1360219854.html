      <p>And since I'm watching my take on who's who based on the ten episodes I've seen
Hakeem: Myungjae
Aaron: Matthew 
Miguel: Gunwook (I've only seen him for one ep but he's so sexy)
Leah: Ricky (mostly because they both speak slowly honestly but also it factor)
Liv: Taerae
Jana: Hao?
Serena: Hanbin? These two could be switched 
Kendall: Gyuvin 
Rob: Jiwoong</p>
