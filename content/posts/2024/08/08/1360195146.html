      <p>it's actually starting to bother me how obvious it's gotten that wakeone gives the most important stuff to visuals first and foremost? yujin and gyuvin both getting mc roles when neither are known to be great speakers or mcs? yujin getting more singing lines than taerae sometimes when he's not known as a good vocalist??? I'm sorry but this is starting to piss me off LMAOO even jiwoong got his own variety show bc he was hyped for his visuals when he was never known for his humor and personality God</p>

      <p>I feel like people forget since gyuvins microscandals ruined things but he's always been a favorite ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the jiwoong show was crazy but while yujin was super unqualified for mcing he does have the popularity to back it up i can give him that but gyuvin doesn't even have a stronger core fandom or even just more clout which is crazy like NOW UR JUST BEING DISRESPECTFUL ðŸ¤¬ ugh idk ill probably get rational about this soon but its just so upsetting whateverrrrrrrrr
