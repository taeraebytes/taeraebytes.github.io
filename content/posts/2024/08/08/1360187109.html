      <p>I‚Äôd laugh my ass off if Jihoon is a better tutter than Hanbin because his fanbase would lose 80% of their identity. ‚ÄúTHE BEST TUTTER EVER!‚Äù ‚Äú#1 MAIN DANCER‚Äù ‚ÄúONLY PROFESSIONAL QUEER STYLE MALE DANCER!!!‚Äù They‚Äôd all cry in unison in some vapid attempt at defensiveness and protection over a man that will never know they exist. I feel like Hanbin has been put on a pedestal and while I do believe he genuinely means a lot for future queer idols and representation, at the end of the day tutting and waacking and ballroom are just some of the many styles of dances in the world. While Hanbin does mean a lot for representation, his speciality doesn‚Äôt inherently have more worth than to say those that specialize in krumping.</p>

      <p>It would be surprising since he's so closely associated with it and given the title but honestly it isn't too crazy to here kpop fans will rlly just hype their idols up to be the best at anything even if they're not. It's just crazy to me how much people have made it an identity marker for him
