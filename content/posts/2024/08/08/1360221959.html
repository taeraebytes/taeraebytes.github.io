      <p>The important thing about the sound aka the beat of the song is the composers, lyrics are whatever and arrangement only helps into the quality of the song</p>

      <p>ahhhhhh ok ok so it's composing before production? Idk if they're the same thing but I feel like I don't have a solid idea of road movie based off anything I'm just using the poster

      <p>So basically a composer makes the base of the song and how it's going to sound. The person who does the arrangement just uses that base as a guide and they basically add auto tune here and there, some synth here and there, they basically piece everything together and it's the last thing that it's done. Sometimes it's: lyrics > composition > arrangement and other times it's composition>lyrics>arrangement but arrangement is always the last thing.</p>
