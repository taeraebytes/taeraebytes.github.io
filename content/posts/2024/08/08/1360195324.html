      <p>FAWK pretty privilege because that has to be the only reasons mucore would pick Gyuvin over Gunwook. Not only does Gyuvin stutter a lot and isn’t the most eloquent (which is a prerequisite to be an mc), he very likely can be a liability. Imagine if he makes some inappropriate joke subconsciously or without realizing it and the jebs get attacked. Or he says something slightly weird on accident with female idols, which I can see happening over the course of multiple weeks of him hosting. He’s cooled down since last year but he’s still not the most public friendly member. He gets flustered way too easy for the constant aegyo mc’s do. If he has the opportunity for a solo stage wtf if he going to do (idk if mucore does solo stages for mc’s but like in the case they do - what can Gyuvin show off??? Even if he lipsynchs he can’t lipsynch well - literally watch any of the award shows from earlier this year or the MAMA performance). 😃🔫🔫🔫</p>

      <p>crazy thing is gunwooks also more popular than him in korea and a much stronger fanbase like they just missed the opportunity of a life time CLEARLY THE VISUAL STATUS DIDNT KEEP THE FANS AROUND 😒 im not gonna wish a slip up on him cuz it'll affect the group and just be so embarrassing but its just crazy how much higher the possibility is with him and they don't even use cue cards.. good luck Lea Michele ✌️I need gunwook to keep his aspirations to himself next time so gyuvin don't up and steal it or start begging it
