Kim Gyu-bin two days ago? Let me know the date of the comeback in the rabang and there's one more~ It was like this.

Kim's Instagram scaffolding is also gone..

It's time to come here. I'm nervous."

      <p>Diff anon but I think they do mean finsta because they said 'Kim's Instagram scaffolding' and when they say scaffolding it means priv ig I'm pretty sure because I remember seeing the world 'scaffolding' a lot when antons finstas were exposed.</p>

      <p>the og tweet said 김즁 so it could've translated wrong but they were definitely talking about jiwoongs ig which is deacted. i just did the twitter translate so it could've put personal ig=scaffolding but ik that words mainly used for finsta so idk ab that

김즁 인스타 비계도 사라졋대..

      <p>Okay this person is kinda jut making a random prediction cause they brought up jiwoong’s “private account disappearing”, i think the are confused with the issue when he lifted it off private. makes sense cause most kzeroses dont pay close attenton to what jw does. And gyuvin mentioning theres something else other than the cb date is so dumb theres around a billion things that surround a cb we dont know about yet. Its way too early</p>
