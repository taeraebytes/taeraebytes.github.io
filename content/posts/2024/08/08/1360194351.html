      <p>I seriously donâ€™t think I would be able to handle it if Mr. Mango ever gets a permanent MC role heâ€™s been obsessing over it for so long he would NEVER be able to shut up about it

I hate the permanent mc schedules more than anything like i try to follow at least one fan/update account for each member to keep up with what theyâ€™re doing to some extent but the constant MC related posts/other solo schedule related spamming makes it unbearable like i donâ€™t want to see 30 billion pics from Mcountdown every week like GO BE WITH YOUR GROUP WE DONâ€™T HAVE TIME FOR THIS</p>
