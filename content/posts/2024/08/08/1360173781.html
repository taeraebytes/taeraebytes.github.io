    "question": "I'm a interviewer for a healthcare company so my whole job is conducting interviews (i only send the info but i don't choose or recruit anyone) . If i can give advice, i'd say try be confident and act like you have the job already, so talking about what kind of elements you're excited to do. Yeah speaking to whoever interviewing you on a personal level is very good, like giving compliments at the end, an applicant told my colleague see you next week and it had a lasting impact. So show your personality don't just talk about work, theres a bias to people who talk about interesting hobbies and explain if theres any way you want to bring it into the workplace. Anyways imposter syndrome can be bad i interview people who are way more accredited than me so sometimes i find it hard too, but the calmer you are the more ready you will come across. Sorry if this was too general, wishing you luck!!!",
    "reply": "no this is rlly good advice like confidence is really key!! I also forgot if you can, maybe write a thank you note to the interviewer afterwards I learned about it from my professor last year who also does a lot of interviewing and recruitment normally I'd say it's overkill for a small regular job but since this is the governments office I think it's appropriate plus you'd stand out nobody sends thank you notes AND GOOD LUCKKK"

      <p>This is pretty high profile so it's nerve wracking no matter what circumstance ur in. Honestly I have no experience with that so idk I feel like preparing for the generic interview questions and interviewing urself helps also try coming up with questions specific for the job. My best interview tip is probably chatting up the interview a bit and getting them to talk about themselves they'll just like you better on a personal level
