      <p>in some of her recent pictures but bailey would get dragged so bad for her rounder face and nose I think she's cute but we know how it is but she's better off continuing her career

      <p>i really wanna know why she went inactive and had dancer friends congratulating her if it isn't going to be in meovv and debut... like if she's going to be their in-house choreographer or something idk why she'd have to leave social media?</p>

      <p>right I think maybe they used her as a hype device or something changed along the way becoming an in house choreographer would be terrible for her tho

      <p>More than an in house choreographer I think she will just train them the same way that Bada trained Hanbin and Redlic trained Aespa.</p>
