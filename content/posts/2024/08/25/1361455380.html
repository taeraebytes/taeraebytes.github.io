      <p>sorry this might be long but as a massive hanbin tweaker from the holy days of bp sometimes he annoys me so bad i hate it when he like idk? makes his lips all round ish, jerks his head back and does reactions like he’s an anime girl like please hanbin 😭 esp when it’s some idol talking to him and he’ll widen his mouth and give that little fake ass laugh and nod his head aggressively FUCKKKK MY LIFEEE like this bitch is always so shocked CLOSE UR MOUTH HANBIN why couldn’t he be mysterious and nonchalant….

and it’s like this isn’t even him yk?  🧎🏻‍♂️‍➡️ his mother and sister have talked about his idolsona and he himself too that he plays up this part of  fan service king when irl he dgaf that’s not even HIM bro 💔 he’s more of a short replies dry as hell guy but he’s out here how was ur morning beautiful sunshine princessing 💖🌊 ik it’s for the check but still 🧎🏻‍♂️‍➡️

 him and his 4 emotes piss me off so bad but  god has once again burdened me with unrelenting love</p>

      <p>not the anon but same, what pisses me off is that I don't even think it gains him something, like he's doing too much for absolutely no gain. In general, some of his choices are really questionable</p>

      <p>wellll I think it makes sense he's an mc so that requires more of a personality I think they're probably just peeved cuz they'd rather a more "authentic" fan idol relationship

      <p>Wait, let me ask you guys genuinely. Isn't it very common to all idols?? All idols does cosplaying at least if we rate it its 70 -80% and only 30-20% probably the real them (personality). That's what you call an individual doing his job. Its the same for us, work is work and we can act professional in our work place and act differently in our home or outside workplace. What I mean is, no one knows them personally and they do hide their true self in public thats why they're protecting their private life which can separate them in public eyes and can live like a normal person (although its difficult to hide). And they literally got all the public eyes so they were very careful if they want to succeed and avoid misfortune and too much negative judgements from people</p>

      <p>obviously but there's a disconnect if people feel like there's an obvious front generally most idols don't even have personas they just omit facts and information so we still don't know them but fans are always going to chase whatever idea they have in their heads that's just how it is
