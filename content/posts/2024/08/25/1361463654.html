      <p>I was checking numerological compatibility with Zeinab, and she said Gyujin and Jiwoong Ricky should avoid each other because the gyuvin star is not compatible with Yujin. The gyuvin star will bring sorrow and grief to Yujin, and he may get into some trouble as a result of it. The same is true for Jiwoong, and Ricky may be affected as a result of it, or vice versa.</p>
