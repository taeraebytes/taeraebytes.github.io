      <p>Once people get fillers, they canâ€™t stop ðŸ«£getting fillers stretched the skin and even if removed, it ends up looking weirder so fillers have to be continued</p>

      <p>Anon, skin is inherently elastic. It goes back to its original condition after sometime since your body is still producing collagen and hyaluronic acid. ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>it's more about the look of it than the skin not being able to bounce back you get so used to seeing yourself with the filler that when it starts dissolving and looking different you feel like you have to touch it up to look "normal" again so you keep going back</p>

      <p>filler blindness is so real especially in the case of when idols get praise for it like rn everyone's liking the changes in haos face (when he's not puffy obv) so he's probably inclined to wanna upkeep that look
