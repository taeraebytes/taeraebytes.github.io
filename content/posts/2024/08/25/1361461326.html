      <p>The haobinmattwookjin IG live had at least around 19k viewers at all times 😁 The woongtaerikgyu IG lives peak was 15k viewers and it declined down to 12k. Where are all of these "people" that like Jiwoong and Rickys IG posts 🤭 Who needs who again? 👂</p>

      <p>it’s 100% jiwoong’s fault as always because taerae ricky and gyuvin would’ve actually been a fun unit with ANY other member it’s crazy how he can ruin so much even when he’s not doing anything like his presence alone is enough to kill the vibes

they were so stiff it was like gyuvin tried to go into mc mode while acting as uncle’s handler like STOPPP IT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE TERRORIST HERE!!!! let’s take off the hanbin wig and go back to revealing someone else’s private information instead

If they had just replaced jiwoong with gunwook we would’ve had the unit from the September 9th 2023 disaster live back💔 yes there was some chaos and yes it caused some problems for us but the vibes were definitely there and I will always remember it fondly… it felt like we were back on VLive that day …</p>
