      <p>This isn’t me glazing &team or whatever cuz they gen bore me but Maki has the best face card out of all 5th gen but no one ever brings it up cuz he was born in like 2006(?) so a lot of people feel uncomfy talking about it and he’s in a Japanese focused group. Like damn, the wasian genes really hitting with his face in regards to striking features. He looks the best out of the group def and I fully expect as he gets older to look even better and to get more well known. He blows Wonbin out of the water for sure. Future visual king in the making please tell me I’m not tweaking

      <p>SAY THATTTTTT makis my favorite in the group and he's easily the best looking but idk I feel like he's a bit of an acquired taste imo his visuals are pretty unique but he's definitely gonna grow to be even more handsome but mmmm idk about like washing every other visual and coming out on top he's gorgeous for sure but he doesn't fit the current standards so he won't even be considered but he's tea as fuck
