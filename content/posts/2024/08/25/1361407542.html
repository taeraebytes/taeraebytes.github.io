      <p>has anyone else noticed an influx of cfans? i think ever since hariboz running man and zb1 got douyin it seems like there's more & they are generally yuehuaz or whole group stans. don't know how to explain but this new crop of fans feels less solo stannish because they didn't go through bp? this is mostly from i've seen on weibo and xhs but i see them on pluschat too sometimes</p>
