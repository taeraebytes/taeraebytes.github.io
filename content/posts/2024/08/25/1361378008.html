      <p>Let me be messy for a second a lot of y'all specifically this one particular fanbase keep asking for more solo schedules and opportunities but frankly haobinjin in particular had a lot of BIG opportunities and are constantly highlighted and it didn't do shit for the group we lost more than half the fanbase from in bloom, either they just don't have it and they should promote Ricky like that instead, or maybe the vast focus on solo things literally doesn't help anyone at all and has never done so since the beginning?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHuge drama ost, mc job, variety appearance, fashion events, special year end stages... literally none of that even brought a slight wave of interest in the group</p>

      <p>well yes ur right starting off with the solo schedules and pushes never worked and fucked a lot up the truth is unless the group is popping there's barely any wave of interest and that's the issue. they also just don't give rlly suited things to the right people so if Ricky was able to have something he was gonna shine in sure he could do more but that's only if. let's say he attended a bunch of fashion events that would probably do nothing or he appeared on a dating show panel also would do nothing wakeone didn't push the group they focused on certain members in different volumes over time and their gigs aren't always suited. It's crazy how much they fucked up like having a survival show group is so much more fortunate than a regular group there's interest and demand behind every member but they shelved them early on
