      <p>Once people get fillers, they canâ€™t stop ðŸ«£getting fillers stretched the skin and even if removed, it ends up looking weirder so fillers have to be continued</p>

      <p>Anon, skin is inherently elastic. It goes back to its original condition after sometime since your body is still producing collagen and hyaluronic acid. ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Anon, those who have stretch marks are the people who got big suddenly shocking their skin. Scarring is different. You have so many factors playing on that. But filler won't stretch & tear your skin so it isn't supposed to cause sag or whatever on your skin ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>hmmmm I wasn't rlly giving an opinion before but filler can distort ur face tho especially if you've had it for a long time even if you get it dissolved you're not gonna go back to how you were before
