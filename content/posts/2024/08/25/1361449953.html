      <p>Idk if it was confirmed before but the stylist for that festival is @ aranayeon who did hanbin no audition and his debut photoshoot and his styling when he visited ads. I’m sure it was mentioned here before but I don’t remember there being confirmation but she just posted it on her story</p>
