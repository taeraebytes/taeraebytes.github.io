    "question": "Well, when you adopt a dog you need to understand that it's a commitment. That's the issue with people who adopt dogs, they don't see those dogs as a commitment but as a fun pastime. Getting a dog it's not like getting a nintendo switch on where you go and play when you get bored, and then throw it away when you get bored of the game. A dog it's alive, and can do wrongdoings. At the same time she's stupid as hell, how does your dog ate one passport and then you don't change the place of it so it doesn't happen again. But at the same time it's lilly Allen and she's never been the brightest so not surprised.",
    "reply": "Well at least she doesn't have the dog anymore so she won't be a irresponsible owner"
