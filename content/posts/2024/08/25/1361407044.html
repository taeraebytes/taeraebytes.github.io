      <p>Let me be messy for a second a lot of y'all specifically this one particular fanbase keep asking for more solo schedules and opportunities but frankly haobinjin in particular had a lot of BIG opportunities and are constantly highlighted and it didn't do shit for the group we lost more than half the fanbase from in bloom, either they just don't have it and they should promote Ricky like that instead, or maybe the vast focus on solo things literally doesn't help anyone at all and has never done so since the beginning?🤷‍♀️Huge drama ost, mc job, variety appearance, fashion events, special year end stages... literally none of that even brought a slight wave of interest in the group</p>

      <p>well yes ur right starting off with the solo schedules and pushes never worked and fucked a lot up the truth is unless the group is popping there's barely any wave of interest and that's the issue. they also just don't give rlly suited things to the right people so if Ricky was able to have something he was gonna shine in sure he could do more but that's only if. let's say he attended a bunch of fashion events that would probably do nothing or he appeared on a dating show panel also would do nothing wakeone didn't push the group they focused on certain members in different volumes over time and their gigs aren't always suited. It's crazy how much they fucked up like having a survival show group is so much more fortunate than a regular group there's interest and demand behind every member but they shelved them early on

      <p>the issue with this fandom is when they see a solo push it's never "stop that and give us group stuff" it's always "clearly that doesn't work but it'll work if they gave it to my fave instead" like i doubt that if they gave the solo push to ricky it would be any more effective than it was with the other members but everyone expects it now so we can argue over solo and unit schedules on a spreadsheet. what we NEEDED was a nice, long, full group variety show to serve as a point of entrance for all the new fans but atp it's kind of too late.</p>

      <p>Diffrent anon and you’re right this is a washed topic but I was really thinking about it and I was like wow every other fandom I joined I fell into through their group content and variety. Like every single fandom I’ve been in got me hooked through a clip of their variety and then me going on a binge of all their group stuff to get to know the members and their dynamics with eachother and it just makes me sad that how my other group bnd who only debuted a month and 10 days before zb1 has soooo much group content straight from even pre debut and it really did help in the long run and even like a couple years from now when fans want to get into them they will have all that content to look back on. If we had a lot of group content especially group variety content like run bts, going svt ect we would be in a much better position today 😭</p>
