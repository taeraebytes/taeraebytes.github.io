      <p>sorry this might be long but as a massive hanbin tweaker from the holy days of bp sometimes he annoys me so bad i hate it when he like idk? makes his lips all round ish, jerks his head back and does reactions like he’s an anime girl like please hanbin 😭 esp when it’s some idol talking to him and he’ll widen his mouth and give that little fake ass laugh and nod his head aggressively FUCKKKK MY LIFEEE like this bitch is always so shocked CLOSE UR MOUTH HANBIN why couldn’t he be mysterious and nonchalant….

and it’s like this isn’t even him yk?  🧎🏻‍♂️‍➡️ his mother and sister have talked about his idolsona and he himself too that he plays up this part of  fan service king when irl he dgaf that’s not even HIM bro 💔 he’s more of a short replies dry as hell guy but he’s out here how was ur morning beautiful sunshine princessing 💖🌊 ik it’s for the check but still 🧎🏻‍♂️‍➡️

 him and his 4 emotes piss me off so bad but  god has once again burdened me with unrelenting love</p>
