      <p>I closed off twitter as soon as I got the zhg notification like I'm not going this today. Kwda is in a few days, I wanna be in a good mindset to be enjoying it to the fullest like we have good things to look forward too, like I could ignore rosins getting angry which is always but what I found annoying was the bullshit statement, I felt that escalated things more. I always go through the latest search in the app and all I saw was tags tags and tags ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
