      <p>have you ever considered just listening to a song just to enjoy the music or is it really all about who has what lines for you? youâ€™re acting like hariboz never sing and THEYâ€™VE BEEN SINGING. and hao gets like every chorus usually i promise heâ€™s not killing himself over getting less lines in a remake song, like damn i get its disappointing for your fave to not have many lines but weâ€™ve all been through that in many songs try being a fan of literally any other group before 5th gen made it so everything has to be equal</p>
