      <p>ok but honestlyyyyyyyy things aren't too bad for zb1 at the moment if you ignore this decrepit ancient 2017 armys complaining about jin not having lines ass discourse like the comeback trailer is still banging the posters are still banging the production credits are still banging the sf version concept pics are still banging (we ignore the others) the boys have been raving about the comeback in ways they haven't done in the past the styling for events has been noticeably different, possibly upgraded meaning it'll probably be like that for the comeback LIKE. IT IS NOT THAT BAD idk why ppl are saying it's suddenly gotten bad bc it really hasn't and even then i didn't have many expectations anyway so what we have gotten has been pretty good TO ME</p>
