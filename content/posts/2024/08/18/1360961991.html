      <p>I’m a rosin and maybe it’s because I’m not that deep and emotionally invested in kpop but when I see the reactions to some of these things I get such deep embarrassment and annoyance (because it ruins the whole experience) that I just think about leaving. Like I really see the tweak and think like wow I can imagine being sat in my bed/ in my car / at work/ living my day to day life and getting genuinely worked up and tweaking for a man that I do not know and that does not know me and for things that are really not a reason to tweak in the first place</p>

      <p>honestly I think anyone who's self aware and uses logic would react appropriately being bummed is fine but this kinda reaction and false narrative is something only antipsychotics could fix.. like deep emotions are one thing but over this ouuuuu we need some correction. But I'm just tired of all this like omggggg it gets so hard to enjoy this group sometimes

      <p>Yeah I've been here since the first ep but this is my last ride I'm done😭the only really fun part of stanning were bp and Japanese fancon like literally almost every single thing the company did has been bad and the fandom esp rosins made everything so much worse and even the members irk me now, I've literally been a day one I really tried you can't blame but like there is literally nothing fun anymore about this group😭I'm sad because I follow no one else in kpop so it's like saying goodbye to an interest that has followed me my whole life</p>

      <p>Yeahhh I think this is the last promo period where I'll actively follow the group too, I'll stay til the end but like as a casual fan now it's so sad cause like you I poured the most into that group and I just have so much ideas and I see so much potential for them and it's sad to think this is the best we'll ever have 😭 I hope I'm wrong, and I hope a miracle will happen and they'll renew and have nice, stable career but like it's been over a year I've lost all hope💔</p>
