      <p>ho be calm ðŸ˜­ I had to rewatch like 3 times to get a gauge on lines and screentime cuz that's not the first thing a normal viewer looks towards.... He appeared more in the latter half of the video and it's most likely the fact that there wasn't much material to work with anyways not like they were doing takes for this casual impromptu mv and again half the song imma wait for that part
