      <p>I only get being upset about screentime but idgaf about people being upset about lines. I am a skz fan and everytime they do a comeback they drop track videos on where they show half of the song, and on 90% of the occasion you can only heard like half of the members or 6/8 members at best during those track videos and nobody gives a fuck about it. But you have zeroses who can never smile and can never be happy talking about disbandment and boycott. They are a joke.</p>
