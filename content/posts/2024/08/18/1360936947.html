      <p>I'm gonna say something incredibly controversial but someone needs to call a spade a spade at some point and this needs to be widely called out:
I think it's hilarious to see people complain about gyuwook, twobinz, haobin or woonghao being pushed when there's only one pairing consistently pushed since debut and it's EXTREMELY DISTURBING AND CREEPY! I think we all know that Hao x Yujin completely dominate xhs, I've seen a LOT of explicit fanfiction written about them in the cside and I've heard in the kside too, I think we all know the luckyz boom was very strategically after the yhz meeting which leads me to believe yh are grooming yujin into making him a part of this ship and will continue to push boundaries, and maybe they're waiting til he's 18 but that doesn't make it better he's been in that company since he was 12 ans has known zh since 14
I know people will say it's innocent sorry it's not when you're purposely feeding these people and grooming a child this isn't innocent this is very purposeful marketing 

This group has continuously failed yujin, they called him sexy in the first episode when he was 15, made lip j crush on him into something humourous, pushed him to do the noona thing, don't protect him from adult fans, push him in a ship w old ass Hao who could've been his teacher and no one cares because unfortunately most mlbkdbs are creeps top, also fuck all the adults in the group too they ALL failed him even if he doesn't know it yet

I don't care if people call me dramatic I can see the patterns forming and I'm a marketing major this is disgusting and needs to be called out, everyone ignoring until it's too late is complicit YUJIN IS A REAL LIIFE TEEN. BEING GROOMED I'm tired of no one actually caring about him</p>
