      <p>more than half.. it's definitely just half ðŸ˜­ but I think yall should wait before u decide u hate anything I had to rewatch to figure out the lines cuz it was rlly about the video. And let's be real here hao is definitely going to be doing his thing on their real songs

      <p>have you ever considered just listening to a song just to enjoy the music or is it really all about who has what lines for you? youâ€™re acting like hariboz never sing and THEYâ€™VE BEEN SINGING. and hao gets like every chorus usually i promise heâ€™s not killing himself over getting less lines in a remake song, like damn i get its disappointing for your fave to not have many lines but weâ€™ve all been through that in many songs try being a fan of literally any other group before 5th gen made it so everything has to be equal</p>
