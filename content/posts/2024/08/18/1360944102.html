Now they are on this perc of “they purposefully picked a bit without c line” the just played the first half of the song it isn’t that deep 😭",

Also the part where the mixing got bad is the part they layered members voices and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't tell who was who 🤦‍♀️ I only feel riyangis a little on this one like let's wait for the release"

      <p>ho be calm 😭 I had to rewatch like 3 times to get a gauge on lines and screentime cuz that's not the first thing a normal viewer looks towards.... He appeared more in the latter half of the video and it's most likely the fact that there wasn't much material to work with anyways not like they were doing takes for this casual impromptu mv and again half the song imma wait for that part
