      <p>Hanbin has to start working out if he wants to continue wearing those sleeveless tops. It doesnt look good. Their stylist should ban him from wearing sleeveless tops. We only want members like Ricky, Matthew, Gunwook and Jiwoong wearing them.</p>

      <p>I think they also see it as male whore-ing making them look cheap 😭 I noticed there's a difference, they don't really mind those form fitting tank tops with normal arm cuts and neck cuts but HATEEE those loose sleeveless with low neck cuts and big armpit holes were a titty can pop out LOL</p>
