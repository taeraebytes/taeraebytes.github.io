      <p>Iâ€™m a rosin and maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m not that deep and emotionally invested in kpop but when I see the reactions to some of these things I get such deep embarrassment and annoyance (because it ruins the whole experience) that I just think about leaving. Like I really see the tweak and think like wow I can imagine being sat in my bed/ in my car / at work/ living my day to day life and getting genuinely worked up and tweaking for a man that I do not know and that does not know me and for things that are really not a reason to tweak in the first place</p>

      <p>honestly I think anyone who's self aware and uses logic would react appropriately being bummed is fine but this kinda reaction and false narrative is something only antipsychotics could fix.. like deep emotions are one thing but over this ouuuuu we need some correction. But I'm just tired of all this like omggggg it gets so hard to enjoy this group sometimes
