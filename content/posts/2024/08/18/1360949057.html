      <p>okay here's what I hear:
13-20 hanbin
20 - 28 jiwoong
28 - 32 / 32 - 36 gyuvin (with a bit of gunwook? or someone else at the ends)
36 - 43 matthew
43 - 48 taerae
48 - 53 hanbin
53 - 1:01 taerae
1:01 - 1:09 hanbin
1:09 - 1:16 yujin
1:16 - 1:24 gunwook, but I can't tell who's harmonising with him, esp. the end sounds like someone else...?

observations:
- hao has no lines in this which is.. a choice
- hanbin has the most lines by far, he has three seperate parts, they could have given at least one of those to hao
- wakeone continues to push yujin as a vocalist, which is funny since he's also pushed as the second center, as a dancer, as mc, as everything basically, while other members who are stronger vocalists (matthew, even ricky) don't get many vocal lines 
- ricky having no lines here 
- some of the mixing is so weird like the gyuvin part and last gunwook part you literally can't tell who's singing on the sides 
- jiwoong had a really long line which is uh. what about hao the main vocal</p>

      <p>for me its not even about dissecting is just hearing jiwoong literally right at the beginning that ruins everything for me ðŸ˜­ like i put everything aside, I unclenched my fist and moved on from his scandal and everything he's done but I just can't stand his fucking tone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and it scares me because that one sm producers i forgot her name is known to give more lines to ppl with unique tones so I'm just fucking scared right now cause yes jiwoongs tone is unique but in a bad way.....</p>

      <p>BRO EXACTLY LIKE I ACCEPTED IT WE MOVED ON BUT HIS VOICE FUCKING SUCKS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ scandal aside I don't understand why people would even push this on a track his singing is so ugly and inhuman I would rather have the actual Mickey Mouse himself than jiwoong yuck
