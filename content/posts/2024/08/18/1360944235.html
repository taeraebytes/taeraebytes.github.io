      <p>idk I get that it's not the full song but it doesn't feel great to wait for smth to drop,  look for your bias and barely see him or hear him...otherwise the video was cute hopefully it gains some traction</p>

      <p>no right like im trying to tell myself "who cares about a summer track video right ðŸ˜…" to keep myself sane like idk why wakeone does this shit knowing the fandom and how it's definitely going to backfire and kill the vibe for many i know its just a remake but if they didn't want to spoil the entire song they could've just waitied untill after they comeback officially to piss people off the video is cute and the song sounds adorable too but they could've been more inclusive of everyone if they wanted to only spoil half</p>

      <p>like I can give riyangis their little pass for the mv cuz I dont think there's going to be more. but idt they're trying to piss everyone off I doubt this song would be longer than 3 minutes and it's supposed to be a low effort cute thing someone's gonna get the short end of the stick and I don't think it's a marker for their cb that they defffffinitely took into more consideration I'll just hope the rest of the song is members we didn't hear and I have a feeling the actual cb would satisfy everyone it's the main focus anyways
