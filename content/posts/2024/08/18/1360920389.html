      <p>Hanbin has to start working out if he wants to continue wearing those sleeveless tops. It doesnt look good. Their stylist should ban him from wearing sleeveless tops. We only want members like Ricky, Matthew, Gunwook and Jiwoong wearing them.</p>

      <p>I think they also see it as male whore-ing making them look cheap ðŸ˜­ I noticed there's a difference, they don't really mind those form fitting tank tops with normal arm cuts and neck cuts but HATEEE those loose sleeveless with low neck cuts and big armpit holes were a titty can pop out LOL</p>

      <p>Not this anon and not a riyangi so cmiiw but from what has been said in this cc his k fans like him bulking which was surprising to me because matthew got so much backlash from his kfans so its funny that they're tweaking over a loose tank top ðŸ˜­ I mean I kinda get the whore/ cheap look the other anon was talking about and it can get boring quick, styling wise cause you can only do so much with a tank top so I hope they switch it up today.

Going on a tangent but I wish their stylist paid attention to the demographic when styling the members for an event, as much as we dig the sleeveless and tank top look here japanese ppl dont really fuck with it either. Ricky and Hanbin were sleeveless, Matthew and Gunwook were almost sleeveless and TarTar was sleeveless but had a meshy shirt over so that's like half the group ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>they didn't hate his bulk and they liked it but that doesn't mean they like the styling. Because the novelty wears off after a while and it does just give this skimpy image me personally I'll love a good tank and sleeveless moment but they rllllly do not it's funny ðŸ˜­ but I get it in the sense that they're doing majority of the group sleeveless like it just feels like lazy styling and their concept doesn't even call for that much

      <p>they are generally accepting of the bulking but they hate this styling especially since his branding has always been around the fact that he wears formal style all the time so they just dont think he fits this image</p>

      <p>I agree I agree it's not about his body it's the styling it's rlly the most jarring for Ricky cuz he always covered in a button up now he's naked
