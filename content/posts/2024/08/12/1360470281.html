      <p>Did u know that one of jiwoong's skeletons in the closet will be exposed mid-september and that hanbin will have a small, minor injury early October (he'll be okay/no long term reprucussions). Yujin will finish his time in zb1 without a scandal, gyuvin will get exposed for another gf from when he was a kid but it will blow over fast because he was like 12. Gunwook's public reception will end up getting better (never top 3 but still, people will warm up to him slow and steady). Something important regarding Matthew will be leaked or happen next march, Taerae will continue with how he has been, Ricky will also gain more popularity and there will be a super viral moment for him this winter (I'm talking viral amongst the general public, not just the fandom, and it has the opportunity to do something good for him). Hao will continue on being #1 but will have a minor attitude or negative fan experience scandal that will cause a little disruption but blow over pretty quickly in either january or february. And one of them will get in a gen dating scandal alongside pictures for proof but will claim it as friends getting together in April or May.</p>
