      <p>Same anon that talked about the masseter Botox - yeah, Ricky honestly hasnâ€™t had much. I think itâ€™s just the large sums of filler and swelling he has that makes it seem more drastic than what it is. I recently rewatched his young and rich tall and handsome video and he looks SO good there. I get the aesthetic he wants but man, what a face he had back then without the swelling</p>

      <p>debut era everyone and their mother was getting stuff injected into their faces ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they went ham on rickys chin but it was soo pretty during bp idk why they did it in the first place and i think so too i think the filler is mostly dissolved by now but diff opinion on swelling i think for him he was just hella skinny during bp and 2023 zb1 so now that hes bulking and gaining weight hes also just gaining face weight back and imo looks better cuz did u see him the past 2 months esp isac ðŸ¤¤</p>

      <p>like his natural chin is already long and sharp they really didnt have to touch it but ig they all got a lil too hyped during debut so im glad its dissolved now and I thought his isac hair was nice ðŸ˜­ it looked shorter and he styled it differently for once</p>
