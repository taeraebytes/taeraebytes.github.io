      <p>Yeah there was a 7.1 magnitude earthquake on the 8th and then a minor tsunami. Now the government are worried the quake has made way for an even bigger quake to hit of a magnitude higher than 8 ðŸ˜­ although Iâ€™m not sure when zb1 are coming but the mega earthquake alert is only there for a week, because if one was to happen they are expecting it to happen sooner rather than later</p>
