      <p>Did u know that one of jiwoong's skeletons in the closet will be exposed mid-september and that hanbin will have a small, minor injury early October (he'll be okay/no long term reprucussions). Yujin will finish his time in zb1 without a scandal, gyuvin will get exposed for another gf from when he was a kid but it will blow over fast because he was like 12. Gunwook's public reception will end up getting better (never top 3 but still, people will warm up to him slow and steady). Something important regarding Matthew will be leaked or happen next march, Taerae will continue with how he has been, Ricky will also gain more popularity and there will be a super viral moment for him this winter (I'm talking viral amongst the general public, not just the fandom, and it has the opportunity to do something good for him). Hao will continue on being #1 but will have a minor attitude or negative fan experience scandal that will cause a little disruption but blow over pretty quickly in either january or february. And one of them will get in a gen dating scandal alongside pictures for proof but will claim it as friends getting together in April or May.</p>

      <p>Maybe he got a secret child that's why he doesn't stay with them I've never really understood why a random gf would have him risking his career and not living with them I've never seen a rookie kpop idol do that</p>

      <p>he kind of just seems like he just doesn't gaf and wouldnt live with them even if he didnt have a gf but imagine how crazy it would be if he managed to hide a wife AND a child this whole time</p>

      <p>I think I would cry but yea honestly even if he wasn't rumored to have all this he still would probably kick it at his own place
