      <p>I think the people who are gonna be a problem is jaehyun taemin and chanyeol chanyeol already has double the amount of pre orders zb1 has on ktown4u and im sure he has a cbar too and has the possibility of charting too exols are good at voting too taemin and jaehyun are def gonna chart very well and have some physicals but will suck at voting</p>

      <p>the charts was something we were never gonna think about anyways but for physicals I don't think anyone is gonna reach a million sales so we're good the only thing is voting and I'm pretty sure plave would be harder to handle than them
