      <p>Obviously more than clubbing lmao he was def doing something real bad and for him to even expose himself like that in the first place was already crazy I kinda think he was told to do that

      <p>i don't even really remember what happened so it was crazy to witness bc it felt like no one was translating and i'm nosy as fuck. like wdym (from what i gathered) a fan confronts u at a fansign about seeing u clubbing with ur idol friends? i can't even remember how he responded but he would've been done either way since that's just a crazy thing to happen at a fansign. i think he responded in a way to be like "i wasn't there to hook up with women so dw" tho. i know one of the nugu idols involved left his group but idk if that was a result of it, i know there was also a golden child member but their contracts are up this year so they'll probably disband and ig he doesn't need to leave the group if that's gonna happen anyway</p>
