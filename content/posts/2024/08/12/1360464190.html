      <p>ngl it’s not just this cc but overall from being on here for like almost a year according to some of you guys he gets new fillers like twice a week for every new public appearance do you realise how crazy he would look if he did that 😭 i’m not saying he never does get them but omg do you think idols are not real human beings, sometimes you get bloated, sometimes a bad photo/angle/perspective makes you look different, diff makeup and sometimes you just have a good face day, sorry i just really needed to vent because almost every time he has a public appearance someone will go “omg these new fillers”</p>

      <p>what? ngl this is a recent development I think besides the new people everyone's just pointing out what they see cuz like you said on certain days it's just more apparent it was obvious during the mud festical but he looked fine at isac. I personally have never said anything is brand new just that I didn't notice the stark change because everything's gradual but comparing him now to a year ago the difference is there hence the joke 😭.. but nah it's obvious he only gets touch ups before cbs it's just usually not good obviously people get funny about it like Ricky never caught a break when he was on his chin filler high it's fine lmao and not nearly as much as when I'd talk shit about his implant

      <p>why are rosins always playing the victim card 😭 trust it's not just hao, we talk about everyones faces unbias and it's never serious

eg.
hanbins chin when he was eating that egg
rickys in bloom filler chin
taerae fresh lip fillers a month ago when he couldn't stop pouting and playing with it during a fansign
gunwooks filler nose
jiwoongs botox face and veneers where he looks insane when he smiles, insane in a bad way btw
yujins gyuvin balding 

like these are just some examples out of many and it's all just jokes and speculations at the end of the day cause this is a gossip cc.... as for hao he just has one of the most inconsistent face out of the group and its why we talk about it</p>
