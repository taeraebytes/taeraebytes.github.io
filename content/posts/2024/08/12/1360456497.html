      <p>Hao hid the dating from the company for four months, was discovered by Ricky and Matthew, and later admitted that he was dating in secret. The girl Hao was dating was a rich girl from a prominent Chinese family, and he dated her because of his family! So the Chinese saying about dating is correct, and there are some photos that will be leaked soon? how reliable are these weibo melon accounts cause ainâ€™t no way ðŸ˜­</p>
