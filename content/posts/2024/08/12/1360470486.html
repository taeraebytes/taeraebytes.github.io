      <p>Did u know that one of jiwoong's skeletons in the closet will be exposed mid-september and that hanbin will have a small, minor injury early October (he'll be okay/no long term reprucussions). Yujin will finish his time in zb1 without a scandal, gyuvin will get exposed for another gf from when he was a kid but it will blow over fast because he was like 12. Gunwook's public reception will end up getting better (never top 3 but still, people will warm up to him slow and steady). Something important regarding Matthew will be leaked or happen next march, Taerae will continue with how he has been, Ricky will also gain more popularity and there will be a super viral moment for him this winter (I'm talking viral amongst the general public, not just the fandom, and it has the opportunity to do something good for him). Hao will continue on being #1 but will have a minor attitude or negative fan experience scandal that will cause a little disruption but blow over pretty quickly in either january or february. And one of them will get in a gen dating scandal alongside pictures for proof but will claim it as friends getting together in April or May.</p>

      <p>jiwoong - gf and not living in dorm expose
hanbin - i can see it happening because he sometimes just looks physically weak as in not eating enough or resting enough so i can see him injuring himself because of that esp with tour
yujin - kingie
gyuvin - prob sullyoon bf stans trying to bring gyuvin down because of the 5 weeks mc duo and they cant stand it so they try to bring up his old dirt that we zeroses/ bp watchers already know about so it doesnt really matter hence it blowing over
gunwook - finally getting appreciated for being an ace and natural variety sense and the start of it was the isac white board 'live tweeting'
matthew - i actually have no clue so im curious, any ideas what this leak could be?
taerae - aw kinda sad I hope he gets like another ost or something
ricky - idk if u guys know this but k gp is actually reaalllly fond of ricky so I can see it happening, they were comparing him to wonyoung in a good way and it went viral on korean yt shorts recently. also before u guys tweak fond â‰  stan, they just know of him and really respect him
hao - prob some fan airport drama like what happened today but it keeps happening so he gets somewhat visibly annoyed and antis try to start some 'bad attitude' shit but wont stick</p>
