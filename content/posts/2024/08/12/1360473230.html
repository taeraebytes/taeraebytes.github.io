    "question": "so many of y'all aren't 3rd gen hags and likely don't know about it (i think queef does because they've mentioned it before) but sehun was the chinese kingie for awhile. HUGE C-Bar, biggest Korean Celeb in China, like HUMONGOUS. It's hard to understate his relevance back then. EXO also has a lot of fans because early debut the group was split into EXO-K and EXO-M, with EXO-M being targeting China. After some of the members left they convened and just promoted as EXO.",
    "reply": "Yea I know exo were the biggest kpop bg there and sehun was huuuuuuggge like his cbar don't play and it's impressive how old they are now and his bar is kicking still"
