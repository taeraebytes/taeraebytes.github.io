      <p>ngl it’s not just this cc but overall from being on here for like almost a year according to some of you guys he gets new fillers like twice a week for every new public appearance do you realise how crazy he would look if he did that 😭 i’m not saying he never does get them but omg do you think idols are not real human beings, sometimes you get bloated, sometimes a bad photo/angle/perspective makes you look different, diff makeup and sometimes you just have a good face day, sorry i just really needed to vent because almost every time he has a public appearance someone will go “omg these new fillers”</p>

      <p>what? ngl this is a recent development I think besides the new people everyone's just pointing out what they see cuz like you said on certain days it's just more apparent it was obvious during the mud festical but he looked fine at isac. I personally have never said anything is brand new just that I didn't notice the stark change because everything's gradual but comparing him now to a year ago the difference is there hence the joke 😭.. but nah it's obvious he only gets touch ups before cbs it's just usually not good obviously people get funny about it like Ricky never caught a break when he was on his chin filler high it's fine lmao and not nearly as much as when I'd talk shit about his implant

      <p>I don’t think we talk about his fillers too often here tbh 😭 the only big 3 events I can think of was the chin implant when that pann article was trending comparing him and wonbin, the time he was at the airport and his forehead looked very tight and shiny and everyone said he got filler and at the tt fansign event just because he looked noticeably diffrent from isac which was less than a week ago</p>

      <p>1. we mostly only talked about his obvious chin implant u rosins still deny and 2. maybe spam haos ment chat and tell him to stop playing with his face where it looks different every few days then we'll stop talking about how his face looks different 😭😭😭😭 ricky is such a good example cause we shat on his filler chin every day but ever since he stopped playing with it and let that shit dissolve we stopped talking about it and even say he looks better with his natural chin 😭</p>

      <p>like this is how I know they don't know their stuff the implant was a bigger topic than the fillers cuz it didn't start looking off till recently and thank you Ricky's chin was such a hot topic they wanna die for that #1 spot so bad damn

      <p>that's interesting because all that he's been getting recently is positive attention on the kside for his visuals especially after he dyed his hair but sure keep spending your hours talking about him</p>
