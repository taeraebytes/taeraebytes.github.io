      <p>The worst thing about nct wish is that jaehee, the one with the bullying rumors, as just as good or arguably a better vocalist than hao and Taerae. No one ever talks about it because the group is new and he’s the least liked member (plus bullying accusations) but just imagine them in half a year and their fandom arguing with zeroses over the title of “best 5th Gen make vocalist”, like our fandom is gonna have a heart attack. Especially sucks because he’s sincerely good and can also rap so we can’t even say he’s untalented  😭</p>
