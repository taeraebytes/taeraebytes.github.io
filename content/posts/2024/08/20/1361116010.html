      <p>That’s so weird and messy, who are the 5 members because the og lineup from the show was 9 members but then yuehua added in like 3 more of their own trainees who didn’t make the lineup</p>

      <p>ok so i think only the members who got added after the show ended plus ollie aren’t participating and apparently those members are from hong kong and technically under separate management so they don’t promote with them full time

i was reading that one cpop cc to figure out whats up with ollie it seems like his rep is just so bad rn they have him on time out and theres a chance they’ll just debut him solo once things cool down. also apparently duhua’s daughter is a big ollie fan so thats why he gets favored and pushed so much😭</p>

      <p>diff anon, i was curious about the cc so i went and found it, it's this and you can scroll up on this ask to read about it 
<a href="https://curiouscat.live/huangzi/post/1361015347">https://curiouscat.live/huangzi/post/1361015347</a> . but this has me wondering about his relation to yuehuaz like when he went on that c survival show that made it obv to me that he won't come back and debut in korea afterwards but now it seems set in stone since cfans don't seem to like him so imagine him and hao were in the same group, i feel like crosins might be mad as hell 😭 i remember a few months ago ollie did that live where he said hao is jealous of him bc he can be more 'open' as an idol working in china but now after all that's happened in relation to attitude/professionalism problems and whatever else is happening with him over there.... haohao let's stay away from that demon child 🙏❤️ also funny that ollie is this cute loved baby to everyone intl (makes sense bc they weren't checking for him after bp) but the c side just does not seem to fw him at all like woah</p>

      <p>NENFNDNDMDMKCKD HE SOUNDS LIKE A BAD ASS KID 😭😭😭😭😭😭 mmmm I don't think he would ever redebut with the rest of the yuehuaz it seems like duhua has her special favoritism for him and is just gonna figure out how to keep pushing him in china. But the attitude shift is crazyyyy he was nothing like this on bp wow
