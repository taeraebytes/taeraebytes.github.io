      <p>I think it's because nobody is normal about hao and this simple scene in a music video has people acting up and becoming entitled over his sexuality which mind u nobody has any confirmation on. sucks that he's always going to be reduced to crude tokenism in favor of proving points and becoming representation while they literally use stuff that was maliciously spread id end it if I were a rosin. 

and I have noooo intention of furthering this topic or hearing opinions idc it's getting deaded here ✌️
