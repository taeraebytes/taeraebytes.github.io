      <p>no he really is cuz ngl while some of his fans find it uncomfortable imagine how fueling this is for parasocialism ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and yup they're gonna call him sex obsessed if he gets into a typical nct scandal lmaoooo

      <p>Even without a scandal he's gonna regret doing all this in like a few months ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ Fueling parasocial-ism this early on and to this extent is just a sasaengs dream and he's only gonna gain more sasaengs and esp the more crazy ones. I wouldn't be surprised if his 'normal' fans become sasaengs because of what's hes enabling ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>on the topic of that i feel like zb1 kinda fuel the parasocialism a bit much at times too like i thought they were getting better but then the digimonz live happened and they were fully talking in english about ideal dates and which member they'd recommend for their daughter to date like i couldn't take it bc i just can't with bf/gf stan stuff, i find it cringe, and it's worse hearing it in ur native language rather than having to go through subtitles so i turned my volume all the way down ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ i hope they chill on it a bit bc as anons have been saying, whenever that happens i just picture their future dating scandals like "oh no"</p>

      <p>nah that's really standard stuff like a little parasocialism doesn't hurt and the point of their existence is to sell a fantasy to their fans ğŸ˜­ zb1 used to be clocked innnnn but not rlly anymore it's regular stuff now it's chill the crazy fans were gonna exist without it anyways and this type stuff doesn't come back to bite them in scandal cuz it's part of the job riku is doing smth else entirely
