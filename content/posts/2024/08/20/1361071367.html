      <p>the thing is that lately the hate has been bad... those korean twitter trolls have been getting more annoying about gunwook and i also saw some nasty comments about matthew on a post with a lot of likes bc he's short. then, this mess also happened and i never saw a live with that many bad comments about a member. also for sasaengs the shit that went down with hao at the airport was bad too.

it was time for them to start working and do shit bc...</p>

      <p>zb1 were already very much trolled and hated on but it's gotten 10x worse obviously because everyone hates jiwoong now but it's hitting the other members now and gunwooks back to enemy #1 and it was finally starting to get better too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. but do you mean the girl getting pushed? ngl there's definitely been worse but yea it's actually becoming too much
