      <p>That’s so weird and messy, who are the 5 members because the og lineup from the show was 9 members but then yuehua added in like 3 more of their own trainees who didn’t make the lineup</p>

      <p>ok so i think only the members who got added after the show ended plus ollie aren’t participating and apparently those members are from hong kong and technically under separate management so they don’t promote with them full time

i was reading that one cpop cc to figure out whats up with ollie it seems like his rep is just so bad rn they have him on time out and theres a chance they’ll just debut him solo once things cool down. also apparently duhua’s daughter is a big ollie fan so thats why he gets favored and pushed so much😭</p>
