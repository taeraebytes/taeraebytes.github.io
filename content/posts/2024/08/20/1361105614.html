      <p>Thatâ€™s so weird and messy, who are the 5 members because the og lineup from the show was 9 members but then yuehua added in like 3 more of their own trainees who didnâ€™t make the lineup</p>

      <p>ok so i think only the members who got added after the show ended plus ollie arenâ€™t participating and apparently those members are from hong kong and technically under separate management so they donâ€™t promote with them full time

i was reading that one cpop cc to figure out whats up with ollie it seems like his rep is just so bad rn they have him on time out and theres a chance theyâ€™ll just debut him solo once things cool down. also apparently duhuaâ€™s daughter is a big ollie fan so thats why he gets favored and pushed so muchðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Oh yeah I remember them saying it would be like 2 teams one that promotes in hk and one in the mainland but Ollie was in Both. But iirc the added members are all under yuehua and were supposed to be under the mainland team not the hk one</p>
