      <p>If you were in Hanbin's shoes would you have publicly address the hate live? I think I would just based on what some anons were saying like atp u can't even ignore it if every other comment is hate or about rumors and people who were present during the live can see the comments too so it's just awkward on both sides.</p>

      <p>It was awkward like the chat was fucked and if you saw the whole clip there’s a whole bit before he spoke about it where he’s just staring at the chat like 👁️👄👁️ because of all the shit that was flooded on there</p>

      <p>I am sorry but I don't understand how Hanbin and Zhang Hao are close friends, maybe bc i kinda have a weak mentality not shaped to be a celeb but if I was either of them, some resentment would exist bc of the shit that the fans of the other say to me.</p>

      <p>if they both have strong mentalities they'll be fine I can see how they can remain friends you just have to trust each other cuz these people don't actually know them

      <p>I used to think that until Hao did all that for Hanbin birthday like damn he really went to his job and everything with a cake and even got himself on wayv backstage room just to wait for him, like idk for a low energy introvert like ZH you don't do that for just anyone.</p>

      <p>i think they're still close they just don't talk about each other much in lives because none of their fans can be normal about their relationship lmao</p>

      <p>I think Hao pretty much said this directly in a fs? I think Wakeone should've cashed on haobin very early on because now it's just an uncomfortable part of the group where you have to hide them when they could've been a great strength promo wise</p>

      <p>that they don't mention each other for peace? honestly I don't think any amount of duo push would've saved them from their akgae wars it would've probably made their duo fans grow but that's rlly it

      <p>i do recall he said something like "no matter what happens/what people say, our relationship/we will remain strong" (very paraphrased bc i don't remember the actual specifics), i think that's what anon is referring to. i don't think they had to do a duo push but i do think if there was a bit more duo stuff at the beginning that was casual like idk, a live or variety guesting, then it wouldn't be as tense bc now i think if they did something duo related it'd be a mess. especially a live, as i mentioned, like the comments would be insane.

i do think that would've been very tricky tho bc everyone is very sensitive about hao's centre position like when that debut teaser came out with them and the candle and those duo tiktoks iirc some ppl thought hanbin was also being treated as a centre</p>

      <p>Yea I think it could've prevented this kind of tension but it could've made things worse also because of how things were going back then with the hanbin schedules
