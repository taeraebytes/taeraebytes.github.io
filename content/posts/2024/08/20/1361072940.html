      <p>It was awkward like the chat was fucked and if you saw the whole clip there’s a whole bit before he spoke about it where he’s just staring at the chat like 👁️👄👁️ because of all the shit that was flooded on there</p>

      <p>I am sorry but I don't understand how Hanbin and Zhang Hao are close friends, maybe bc i kinda have a weak mentality not shaped to be a celeb but if I was either of them, some resentment would exist bc of the shit that the fans of the other say to me.</p>

      <p>if they both have strong mentalities they'll be fine I can see how they can remain friends you just have to trust each other cuz these people don't actually know them

      <p>no but if someone's fans are such a pain in the ass and hate me this much, half my own fans can't stand him, and the other half think we're fucking.. i honestly woudn't be able to interact with that person</p>

      <p>as someone who doesn’t have lots of mental energy to use, I’d just stay far far away from that person 😭 like im not gonna see this person after two years, if i have a headache almost daily handling the fandom politics that come from interacting w him, im just gonna veryyyyy slowly distance from him like the mess is just not worth it im sorry 🫶</p>

      <p>Are you anons dense or just friendless two years is obviously enough to become very close or form deep relationships especially when you've all done a show like boys planet together??? How do you guys even start dating if you think two years isn't enough to form deep bonds😭</p>

      <p>A bond is there ofc but “DEEP bond and trust” comes from time , no one is willing to throw away their sanity and self preservation within a fucking year</p>

      <p>That’s actually crazy like anon wow you really must have not met people you fw like that because I met my current roommate and moved in with her in less than 6 months and now it’s been 3 years and this girl is my sister ride or die. Like I’ve had friends that I’ve known longer but I just clicked with her in a way I haven’t with others so it’s completely possible to get super close to someone in a year</p>
