      <p>It's sad cause they have all great chemistry and are good looking and talented their circumstances are all just so bad and they probably have 4 more contractual years in the industry right after ugh I do feel like if they resign it won't be as bad bcs a lot will leave but atp I think I'd prefer them all to live normal lives too</p>

      <p>honestly like the game has changed so much and it doesn't favor them at all I would accept it if they all led regular lives after all this too but I hope they at least leave their companies like why's almost everyone in for mess but I'm coo if they wanna continue which is like most likely
