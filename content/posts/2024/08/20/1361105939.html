With gyuvin he was originally 5? he was more casual material but his core fandom wasn't bad while gunwook has always had a strong core so when gyuvins rep went bad they switched but the gap between 4 and 5 was a lot bigger then it's smaller now cuz gunwooks been gaining gyuvin has too and im sure the recent schedules are helping a bunch but because he lost so much idk if he'd catch up because everyone's growing. \n\nI'm not too sure if back during zb1s height who was more popular between ricky and gyuvin in korea it's been so long"

      <p>Imo Ricky 4 makes sense because he's top 5 in Korea no doubt about it and if Gyuvin is in top 5 he's above Gyuvin im sorry ðŸ˜­ gap is pretty big from what queef said and he has probably top 3 and dare I say 1 when it comes to gp reach outside our fandom and it's crazy to admit as a rosin. Half of the Korean accs tweaking about his screen time the other day were new accs made in the past 1-4 months which adds up because that's when he's been going viral on kforums and kside of ig/ yt shorts.

Honestly Gunwook is above Gyuvin too atp so top 5 in Korea would be Hao/Hanbin Yujin Ricky and Gunwook</p>

      <p>no from the beginning top 3 was always haobinjin and Ricky was probably 4? the groups been growing and Ricky's got a lot of new fans someone mentioned how his fansites are pretty new too. With gyuvin he was originally 5? he was more casual material but his core fandom wasn't bad while gunwook has always had a strong core so when gyuvins rep went bad they switched but the gap between 4 and 5 was a lot bigger then it's smaller now cuz gunwooks been gaining gyuvin has too and im sure the recent schedules are helping a bunch but because he lost so much idk if he'd catch up because everyone's growing. 

I'm not too sure if back during zb1s height who was more popular between ricky and gyuvin in korea it's been so long
