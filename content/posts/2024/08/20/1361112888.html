      <p>tricky because while hanbin might be more known (k1, was the most popular with a gap during zb1s height, MCs on a public broadcast show with other popular bg idols) he doesn't have more fans and his growth is stagnant that's also because the groups stagnant but hao definitely has the bigger fandom now I think. and yea jiwoong was always popular or somewhat while hanbins growing to be idt yujins 5 tho it's between jiwoong and hanbin for 4 and 5. This list isn't too far off but gyuvin is not 4 in korea or china ðŸ˜­ i think he's 5 in china but 6 in Korea Ricky's def 4 there his pc prices are higher and he has more fans
