    "question": "let's get gunwook on his purple shirt instead he's too noodle arm for sleeveless and it's just getting boring and also does anyone hates the stylist never gets him in some jeans/pants that actually fit him? its so irksome and it's been happening since the beginning of their careers i actually check those measurements they post at their debut and him and jiwoong are the same bottom size so if they can find pants for jiwoong then why can't they find for gunwook's too? sorry for the rant but it's something that's been annoying me for a while",
    "reply": "I kinda didn't understand the first sentence sorry BUT YES!!!!

I loved the summer sonic styling but the jeans were so baggy they kinda messed it up a bit like yes he's taller than jiwoong but we don't need all that. he looks the best when his proportions are shown off please give that to us"

      <p>Hanbin has to start working out if he wants to continue wearing those sleeveless tops. It doesnt look good. Their stylist should ban him from wearing sleeveless tops. We only want members like Ricky, Matthew, Gunwook and Jiwoong wearing them.</p>
