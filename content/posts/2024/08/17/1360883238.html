      <p>Came across a video of fromis_9 supersonic demo and it was some dude singing and the comments were all talking about how much the song would fit zb1 and I started tweaking a bit bc the song it's so good and I could 100% see them singing it, and now Hanbin did the TikTok challenge with fromis gawd we need them dropping songs like this one.</p>
