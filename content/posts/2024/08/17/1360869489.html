      <p>i was reminded of this thought i had yesterday when watching a kcon group fancam where hao was singing loud af bc taerae said on plus chat that he tried his best singing today but couldn't be heard but when i watch zb1 performances i notice that taerae doesn't seem to sing live which is kinda crazy bc he's one of the main vocals and very skilled? maybe he wants to focus on dancing more since he lacks more in that area or can i just not tell if he's singing live? i remember seeing a discussion similar to this with engenes and apparently heeseung who is their best is the same in that he doesn't sing live that much for some reason which i forgot ðŸ˜­ i wish i knew why bc it's so wild to me. like obv kpop idols don't sing live all the time but i really appreciate when they do (especially love how hao makes an effort to do it nearly every single time regardless of if they're supposed to lmao) and it's a bit of a shame to me that taerae doesn't seem to do it that often since i can't hear that noticeable difference between him and the backtrack (not necessarily a bad difference but like u can tell it's live) like i do with some of the other members</p>

      <p>Diff anon but if you look at vids from ftp era on i think hao, matt, and surprisingly gyuvin are the most consistent at trying to sing live (quality aside) not saying taerae doesn't sing live though</p>
