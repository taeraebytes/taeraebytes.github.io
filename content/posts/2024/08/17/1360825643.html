      <p>I am not like a riize anti or whatever but genuinely Eunseok and Anton give off the most bizarre vibes ever. Eunseok just seems like someone who’d watch you trip and scoff and look away, and I don’t even know how to word why Anton gives weird energy. It’s not just his quietness, that’s fine and cool and I like the quiet types, but he just has the energy of someone who have a spam account in 2016 and would talk shit about you but act friendly irl. Also the nepotism allegations are not being beat, he can barely keep up in their performances dance-wise and he’s not a strong vocalist or rapper. He’s pretty (even with that nose implant) and he’s tall and built, I’ll give him that, but idk. Sohee is my darling tho and Wonbin’s personality makes me laugh like beneath that beautiful face he’s a little bratty and weird 😭 Don’t care about Shotaro, Seunghan, and Sungchan idc but I do feel bad basically all his fans are the crazy gf type</p>

      <p>okay eunseok yea it's pretty obvious he's also weird but it's a little charming hmmmm idk like he's still a demon but hey i kinda like him 🤷‍♀️ Anton seems like a genuine person I think he's probably the closest thing to a normal idol I've ever seen he rlly was just thrown in there and doesn't look like he was meant to be a celeb. Like he's miskeen af I like him he gives cringe in a cute way and like he's so updated at the same time he seems like cool ppl but damn idk how sohee is ur darling like wonbin i get but SOHEE?! 😅 but sungchan is also evil and Hitler but i like him he deserves it tho he lowkey stole half of Anton's kfans
