      <p>I think ur underestimating the plausible deniability thing‚Ä¶ also what other idol has as ‚Äúflamboyant‚Äù mannerisms as tartar (and I do think it keeps coming up because it makes sense)? Yeah you can argue Hao but like he‚Äôs more quiet and isn‚Äôt as extroverted about it. And ur point about how there are other successful flamboyant idols‚Ä¶. who you referencing? Woongki? Jo Kwon? Sunoo? Like yeah all well known but not a big fanbase except Sunoo and even then he isn‚Äôt as extroverted or acts as femme as taerae. But yeah Taerae‚Äôs styling thing sucks, I think if he genuinely had a good styling or something unique (like push his hair back more, dye it dark blue or something, give him contacts and make him show off his dimple constantly) he‚Äôd pop off popularity wise. He‚Äôs not tall and that‚Äôs okay, put insoles in his boots. He genuinely has a million dollar smile and has so much potential they gotta stop dressing him like he has been. Also never realized the main vocal thing ur so right, same thing happened to Jaehwan during Wanna One, is it other subfandoms being jealous of their lines or something??? I wonder why it happens so much ü§î</p>

      <p>As someone who likes Enhypen, yeah Sunoo has more femme mannerisms but the content that he uploads it's super gf stans focused, you won't see him dancing to super lady like taerae was uploading those tikoks every two days. The problem with Taerae is that he's not feeding those gf fans fantasies, while Sunoo does.</p>

      <p>I've said it a few times but to me taerae always seemed like it was a monkey see monkey do kinda thing like cjnenvmfmkdkd sorry im not convinced plus I feel like even tho I don't pay attention as much there's other aspects of his personality left less discussed like he's multifaceted he's just a guy to me but hey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
