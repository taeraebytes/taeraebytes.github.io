      <p>Speaking of, bets on what level of naked they’re getting on this tour? Ofc Jiwoong and Matt will wear crop tops (plus both will lift their shirts). Gyuvin will wear muscle tees, so will Ricky, with holes big enough to show the side of their abdomens. Gunwook won’t wear crop tops but maybe more muscle tees and will probs lift his shirt. Hao might wear crop tops but he is not flashing his abs. The rest will be normal.</p>
