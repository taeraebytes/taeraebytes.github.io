      <p>I think Taerae‚Äôs drop of popularity is a culmination of a few things: 1. A lot of his BP fans were casual (like what you said), 2. He has a very flamboyant personality and is SO obviously queer that there is no plausible deniability so that killed a lot of delusions that his fans had once more of his personality came out, and while he didn‚Äôt change since BP,  back then he didn‚Äôt have as much screentime to showcase himself so voters probably didn‚Äôt know about him like that unless they watched the YouTube videos most people didn‚Äôt engage with 3. Half of the time they style him it‚Äôs the same old boring things or they style him like a kindergartner and that can be off putting to fans or not interesting to new fans so even tho all the styling for all the members is pretty crap he has it the worst (alongside Matthew‚Äôs constant shorts or jorts ü§®). And 4. He can be unlikable (let me speak my truth üó£). I get it because honestly I act like him a lot but he‚Äôs very particular and does make comments centering himself in variety (if you genuinely observe when they do variety shows, most of his reactions are him saying ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that‚Äù ‚ÄúI can see that‚Äù ‚Äúthat was for me‚Äù or give reactions that take away attention from the other members. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs malicious, just him being himself, but it can be taken wrongly as being attention seeking). If you just observe his mannerisms outside of when he‚Äôs dancing for fun you‚Äôll see what I mean. Plus he‚Äôs not really promoted much on top of all these things so it somewhat makes sense he‚Äôs lost momentum.</p>

      <p>so what's the plausible deniability... and don't say the flamboyant personality like what else is there üò≠ actually don't answer idc but i feel like you can only rlly say that with hao lmao and a flamboyant personality has never stopped anyone from having fans even in korea! I just don't think taerae is queer it's a common sentiment I see but people are always so sure when he doesn't even give much but I'm not knocking it. And I can't lie and say it's surprising that he dropped, it's just having a bunch of casuals then them leaving his chance to build a core fanbase was wasted and here we are. His styling is probably one of the bigger issues now alongside promotion but also the last point mmmm I guess but in general most things u listed are pretty normal idt any are compelling reasons. Taeraes kinda going out like how a lot of main vocals do it's like a weird pattern but truly the #1 thing is the fact that he never got promoted like he could've been going down the sohee route minus the mc thing but look ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
