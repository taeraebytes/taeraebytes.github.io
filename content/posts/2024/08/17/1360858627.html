      <p>what could have been if he got to build his core fanbase during boys planet but they gave my meow meow zero screentime throughout the entire show it's an actual tragedy ðŸ˜­ if you really think about it the popularity ranking has always stayed roughly the same since boys planet and if you didn't get any screentime there it's no surprise that your fanbase would be significantly smaller than members who have gotten the highlight since episode 1 all throughout the show ðŸ˜”</p>

      <p>yea except yujin the ranking is pretty much exactly how the ranking goes ðŸ˜­ yea taerae was actually popular like I rmbr him being k2 but they were all casuals and just voted to have a main vocal he wasn't promoted enough and that's what also killed him I think and now his fans beat on him too wow poor guy

      <p>maybe it's just me, i dont think it's a matter of promotion. he definitely had a big fanbase during the show with his "what's your name" and man in love viral moments. the girls were eating him up because he had that church oppa musician boy next door image but after debut they figured out he wasn't really like that and dropped him. even now a lot of his fans that stayed spend most of their time trying to change his image</p>

      <p>everyone says this but like what exactly changed about his personality from bpðŸ˜­???? He's rlly not all that different and he had pretty much only casuals so when ur not promoted or can't keep the casual pull it just disappears his fans treat him like that cuz azure treats him like that I've never seen a fansite master act like her ðŸ˜­
