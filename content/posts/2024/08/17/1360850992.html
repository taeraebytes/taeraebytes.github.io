      <p>Idk about Hao and adele or western music but imo his taste in Chinese music is pretty good actually him and Ricky both obviously they're very different but I like what they've shown us so far on lives and stuff</p>

      <p>Diff anon but intl age he's 20 rn and he left sometime in 2020 so minus 4 is 16 but say it took him a year? or even half a year to go from black to pink I would guess 15 also puberty did him fucking good</p>

      <p>People who use that pic aren't familiar with him or they just want to hate (probably cause of some stupid stan twt fan war or straight up anti) and want to say he got his whole face done + pretty sure they gen think he's 16 or something in the pic so they use it to compare a '16' y/o pic of him with 20 y/o him to again 'prove' he got his whole face done because he changed in a 'short' amount of time but he's actually 11 in that pic ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

I mean there's a reason why they never use actual 14-15 y/o predebut pics of him where he's actually going through puberty and you can see his features growing in because then there'd be no hate and he has a lot of even younger pics of him where he looks the same but he looks 'good' in those so again they won't use it.
