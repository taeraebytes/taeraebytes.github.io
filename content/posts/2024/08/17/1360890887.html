      <p>I've seen those viral tweets of people saying how Eunwoo doesn't have appeal thanks to that new magazine cover and how he's trying but it's not resulting. And I have to say that Eunwoo is an acquired taste, you know how you find a dude hot and you keep checking on him and then the more you look you are like well he's not that cute bc you start finding more things about their facial features... Well, you need to do the same for Eunwoo and when you start noticing imperfections you actually start finding him hotter.</p>
