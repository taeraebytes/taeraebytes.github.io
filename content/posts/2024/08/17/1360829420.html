      <p>It kills me the way he keeps getting hate for leaving sf9 like it was kinda nasty towards the other members but they need to be serious. The fans were mad as hell saying that he should take a decision between acting vs the group bc he was missing out thousands of schedules thanks to his acting. And he ended up picking acting, which we should all understand because let's be real sf9 it's not going anywhere, he was getting a lot of projects  bc he got some Netflix hype and with the way his acting is mid he probably knew that the hype was going to die if he took an acting hiatus to promote with sf9... He was smart.</p>

      <p>They will be mad at that but won't be mad at the way Hwiyeon and Chani got caught in some salon rooms when COVID was happening, which was one of the biggest hits for sf9 small popularity. And then that dude who committed DUI.</p>
