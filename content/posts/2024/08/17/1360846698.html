      <p>i thought this too (about hao as well) and then i realised it was their choreographer/dance teachers/dance friends like they were dancing to tinashe, charli, yaeji, beyonce etc etc but if you look at the stuff they're actually into then you realise those songs weren't up to them LMAO like hao listens to every kpop song ever and adele and hanbin listens to nct, korean indie and whatever more generic pop koreans like and while some of it is fine lots of it isn't really my vibe ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Yea I was gonna say like from what I see hanbin wouldn't listen to Charli on his own im sure they've seen the trends in turn being exposed to it but like it was definitely not themselves ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>For Hanbin I saw the video a long time ago and it was a choreo made by himself so he picked the song but Hao western music taste fell off to me when he said Adele, I like her songs but cmon...</p>

      <p>Idk about Hao and adele or western music but imo his taste in Chinese music is pretty good actually him and Ricky both obviously they're very different but I like what they've shown us so far on lives and stuff</p>

      <p>Yeah he listens to pretty basic well-known Chinese rnb but like queef said they're songs I'd listen to ðŸ˜­ A decent amount of the Chinese songs he's put on during lives were already on my playlist</p>

      <p>not a riyangi but a rosin and I watched a few of his lives and the weibo lives with hao, he listens to A LOT of joker xue but I wouldn't really classify it as just rnb but a mixture of chinese ballad, folk and acoustics?
