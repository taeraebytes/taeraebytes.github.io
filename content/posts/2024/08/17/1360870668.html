      <p>You don’t like crop tops??? Is it just crop tops on men or do you universally despite them? Lowkey that’s how I feel about chokers on anybody 🫣 they never look good and look like dog collars</p>

      <p>crop top on men just gives me the ick, idk what it is i think its just the male torso anatomy because for women at least theres curves so the shape is interesting but men torso is just boxy so the shirt just looks too small on them like it looks like a grown man shopping in the toddler section and lowkey gives predator vibes I'm sorry men crop top truthers 😭</p>
