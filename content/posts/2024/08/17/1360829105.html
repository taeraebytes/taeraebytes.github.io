      <p>I’m the Keeho bi anon, here is a list of other idols I think are bi but get typecasted as either straight or only gay: keeho (obviously), hao, Matthew, Shotaro (there is something about his energy that gives late bisexual bloomer), Xuimin, minhyuk (monsta x), Jungwoo (but with a preference towards men). Also, here is a list of my other hot takes: all the Blackpink, Le Sserafim, and Aespa girls are straight. Chanhee from The Boyz is a toxic gay who is slightly misogynistic but gets away with it because of his queerness (have y’all seen the way he treats his normal female fans???). Triple S Yooyeon and Soohyun are bi. None of the Kiss of Life girls are queer. And Taeyong is straight.</p>

      <p>diff anon but yknow who i think is bi that everyone else calls gay? Ryujin. Even before she dated Haechan she always just gave off the most bisexual vibes idk how to explain it i think everyone sees a slightly (emphasis on slight btw cuz 💀) masc girl in kpop and automatically calls her a lesbian but she is just so bisexual to me</p>

      <p>Ryujin and Karina are the different faces of the same coin. It's just that one is masc, the other one is femme but both are just straight girls that know how to appreciate women beauty and bc of that their fans swear to god they are lesbians.</p>
