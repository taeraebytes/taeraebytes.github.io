      <p>Iâ€™m the Keeho bi anon, here is a list of other idols I think are bi but get typecasted as either straight or only gay: keeho (obviously), hao, Matthew, Shotaro (there is something about his energy that gives late bisexual bloomer), Xuimin, minhyuk (monsta x), Jungwoo (but with a preference towards men). Also, here is a list of my other hot takes: all the Blackpink, Le Sserafim, and Aespa girls are straight. Chanhee from The Boyz is a toxic gay who is slightly misogynistic but gets away with it because of his queerness (have yâ€™all seen the way he treats his normal female fans???). Triple S Yooyeon and Soohyun are bi. None of the Kiss of Life girls are queer. And Taeyong is straight.</p>
