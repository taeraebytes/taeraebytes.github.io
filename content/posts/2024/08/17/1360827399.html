      <p>what could have been if he got to build his core fanbase during boys planet but they gave my meow meow zero screentime throughout the entire show it's an actual tragedy ðŸ˜­ if you really think about it the popularity ranking has always stayed roughly the same since boys planet and if you didn't get any screentime there it's no surprise that your fanbase would be significantly smaller than members who have gotten the highlight since episode 1 all throughout the show ðŸ˜”</p>

      <p>yea except yujin the ranking is pretty much exactly how the ranking goes ðŸ˜­ yea taerae was actually popular like I rmbr him being k2 but they were all casuals and just voted to have a main vocal he wasn't promoted enough and that's what also killed him I think and now his fans beat on him too wow poor guy
