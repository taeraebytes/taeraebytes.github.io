      <p>Hold on because in the daechinseo live myungjae was talking about hanbinâ€™s aotm and said how he saw the producer of it and the pd said he was next (idk if it was as a joke or not) but he was like nooo because hanbin had to do over 150 takes and 14 hours of shooting so he said it would be so hard</p>
