      <p>I think ur underestimating the plausible deniability thing… also what other idol has as “flamboyant” mannerisms as tartar (and I do think it keeps coming up because it makes sense)? Yeah you can argue Hao but like he’s more quiet and isn’t as extroverted about it. And ur point about how there are other successful flamboyant idols…. who you referencing? Woongki? Jo Kwon? Sunoo? Like yeah all well known but not a big fanbase except Sunoo and even then he isn’t as extroverted or acts as femme as taerae. But yeah Taerae’s styling thing sucks, I think if he genuinely had a good styling or something unique (like push his hair back more, dye it dark blue or something, give him contacts and make him show off his dimple constantly) he’d pop off popularity wise. He’s not tall and that’s okay, put insoles in his boots. He genuinely has a million dollar smile and has so much potential they gotta stop dressing him like he has been. Also never realized the main vocal thing ur so right, same thing happened to Jaehwan during Wanna One, is it other subfandoms being jealous of their lines or something??? I wonder why it happens so much 🤔</p>
