He‚Äôs not tall and that‚Äôs okay, put insoles in his boots. He genuinely has a million dollar smile and has so much potential they gotta stop dressing him like he has been. Also never realized the main vocal thing ur so right, same thing happened to Jaehwan during Wanna One, is it other subfandoms being jealous of their lines or something???
