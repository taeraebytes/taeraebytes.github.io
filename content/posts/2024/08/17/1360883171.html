      <p>Iâ€™m not letting anyone speak on anwana like she deactivated for like 1 day once and then I realised how much I depended on her like when I wanna know the boys schedule and any updates I go to her highlights, whenever thereâ€™s an event I know she will post links and sheâ€™s usually the first one to post about rumoured events ect that end up happening like she isnâ€™t some random account if she dipped sure there are other accounts that have similar content but none that have it all and as easily accessible as she does</p>

      <p>Never was a shooter for an acc and like if she acc did something terrible ofc weâ€™d drop her but like considering how much she gives itâ€™s annoying people wanna drag her for stuff that washed over.
Not really just about her but like so many of our big ot9 accounts just get run off and itâ€™s like we can never have nice things ðŸ˜­</p>
