Now that previews are coming Iâ€™m kinda excited ðŸ‘€ like Gunwook is obvs already a good player, him and gyu are taller than 90% of the other guys, like this might be a chance for him to stand out frfr (as long as they donâ€™t get hurt ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž). Gunwook and Minho interaction = Gunwook becoming an athletic god = global domination = prosperity mhm bwahahaha ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
