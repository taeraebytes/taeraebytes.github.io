      <p>okay I'll go in order jana ateeeee but the dress is stopping her I don't like it 

SERENA PERFECT 10S QUEEN OF THE NIGHT YESSS

Leah looks good but it feels soooooo regular for her hair the same dress not gagging me makeup still the same sis let's try harder 

I appreciate kordell going outside the box he looks good idc this kind of style is fun my complaint is that it doesn't rlly match well with Serena but I fw it 


Nicole look a damn mess and she looks like a new person she's wearing draped rags and she has GOT TO stop the filler addiction...

Simple.. Dominican af... not gagged.. it's a whatever for me 

Drizzy go home 

Hannah just need to kill herself sorry she is the hardest 26 I've seen in my life she's an extreme pillow face and the dress 🤦‍♀️... I'll save my words 

Connor has not once looked human 

Catherine's dress is a mess but omggg she looks so pretty love it 

Coye need to go back to where he came from 

Kaylor looks pretty is it just me or did she like morph into Aaron... I can't not see his face when I look at her but she also needs to chill on the lip filler 

Daniela not gagging anyone which is a shame she's rlly pretty but it's not like anybody's looking for her at this reunion 

I would give Andrea a dollar if I saw her on the street....


Rob can get shot on site.

Daia looks good but she doesn't impress me she is rlly pretty tho 

Aaron uhm I guess the haircuts nice I just find him super ugly so..
