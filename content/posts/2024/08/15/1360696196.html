      <p>Imo
Jana looks beautiful love the hair and makeup but the dress is a miss
I looove Serena's dress and hair she has the best look for me her body is crazy she's gorgeous 
Leah looks gorgeous and her body tea plus her dress is super pretty but I do agree that I wish she did an updo 
Nicole looks a mess lol she's single as fuck 
Kaylor has always been pretty to me her hair and makeup looks great but omg the lip fillers are so unnecessary her lips got even bigger 
I don't like the colour or dress for Liv she looked ten times better in any episode of the show

Don't care about the rest of the girls or the guys but I actually like kordells look personally sorry</p>
