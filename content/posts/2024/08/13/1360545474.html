      <p>He is releasing a song with Kwon Eunbi, maybe they filmed for that but he also filmed this and it's just waiting for the song release to upload the one with his new song. I follow Eunbi (she was my izone fav member) and in some post a Hui fan was like "oh so now we know what he was filming those challenges for" so I am guessing that he went to other companies and told his fans or idk</p>
