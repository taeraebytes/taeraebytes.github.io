    "question": "He is releasing a song with Kwon Eunbi, maybe they filmed for that but he also filmed this and it's just waiting for the song release to upload the one with his new song. I follow Eunbi (she was my izone fav member) and in some post a Hui fan was like \"oh so now we know what he was filming those challenges for\" so I am guessing that he went to other companies and told his fans or idk",
    "reply": "Makes more sense like boo I don't even want hui to produce for them because he will not be making an energetic 2.0 he's just gonna disappoint"
