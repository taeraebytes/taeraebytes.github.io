      <p>different anon but holy shit you really are just stupid as fuck ðŸ˜­ what the hell are u on about, itâ€™s an earthquake where people DIE and have to suffer through many things, youâ€™re so delusional and stuck up in your head, have no one to love you that u spend your time like a fat retard online on discourse about fuckass gunwook who will inshallah never see the light of the day. at the end of the day you need a job application and stop eating burgers and crying over gunwook for a living. real people outside have problems and have to face through things, u need to get out of ur moms basement like a filthy slob and grow some empathy you absolute fucktard</p>

      <p>I'm sorry I know you wanted this to be a read but it's just so weak JFNFNNFNDMFMFMFMFKKCKXKS you lose all seriousness trying to make a point when you bring up my bias 3 times cuz it doesn't connect ðŸ˜­ the attempt at concealing whatever anger you have towards me was cute tho because again what was said that indicated I lack empathy it was a harmless joke with no impact on peoples lives that you care so much about. And if you're gonna come with all this rage have the balls to say it behind identity lmao we further discussed the topic please hop off my dick

      <p>Tbh it depends on the magnitude of the earthquake some of you forget that countries on where earthquakes are common don't stop when earthquakes happen. It's the same for countries like Chile. 

I also live in a country on where earthquakes are uncommon so yeah it's a big deal here but for Japan is not.</p>

      <p>that anon isn't mad that I made a harmless joke lmao they were waiting to write that paragraph about me cuz what does that have to do with anything LMAO but yea at the point that I answered the original cc I wasn't aware of the magnitude or even heard about the news so with how common it is in Japan I didn't think zb1 were in any kinda danger. It's really common for them to have stronger earthquakes and less common in the city so we'd just have to see how things progress I think it's more likely the event continues on since there's still a week
