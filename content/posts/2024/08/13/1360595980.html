      <p>we rlly need to learn to find middle ground yes kfans are entitled annoying etc but they're not useless and they're still the main market. kfans literally contribute the most to their sales too ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and we were able to get wins because of good broadcast points socmed points prevote and live vote points sales get you nowhere otherwise stray kids would be sweeping
