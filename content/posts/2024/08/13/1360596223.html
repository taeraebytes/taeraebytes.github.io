      <p>some zeroses are too quick to judge they always have something to say....yeah the concept pics arent revolutionary or whatever but its cute and wayyyy better than their prev ones. complaining about the soft vibe because it doesn't look like the bad film.... I stan txt they do 3 drastically different concept pics for one comeback so I dont get the dislike, I'm sure the next ver would most probably be darker</p>

      <p>I'm shocked.. zeroses are the fans of MID CONCEPT PHOTOS but they wanna complain about a cute shoot we got I quite liked it and yup way better than the last concept and honestly a step up from photos we've gotten previously. And I think it's pretty obvious what "romance" concept photos would look like ðŸ˜­ they need to chill this obviously not the main concept
