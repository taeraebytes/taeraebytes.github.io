      <p>I wasn't gonna respond to this but seeing as how I got sent the same thing 5 times I'm really really gonna stress how much I don't care about these types of things and that I'm not a commentary cc. My patience is running super thin and I'm not trying to discuss any of this stuff if a hanbin fan says his aotm is the best that's their opinion I could give a lesser fuck about. Moving forward my tolerance for this is at 0 so don't expect me to reply and I'm probably gonna block this is so annoying the bait ccs gotta stop CUZ NOBODY CARES. Gosh
