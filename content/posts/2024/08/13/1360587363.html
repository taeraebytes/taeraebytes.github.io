      <p>that's a bold faced lie it's about 60 ðŸ˜­ but there's an equal amount of cfans and jfans who got in maybe more but I counted the award list ig they're just used to being the overwhelming majority which I get

      <p>I'm now afraid of the comeback streams. kfans on my tl are so pissed, pointing out that there are only few kzeroses left but wakeone is taking care of foreign fans more than them, in their home country</p>

      <p>But zb1 is a kpop group to begin with. It is not their problem that people around the world are obsessed with kpop idols. And kchart is what decides if a kpop group os successful or not. Anyone can get millions of sales, it isn't extraordinary anymore. If they want to be successful then they'll have to cater to the kfans. Ngl I would be pissed too if I was a korean fan but wasn't able to meet them but obsessed foreigners could.</p>
