      <p>let's be real matthew grew up in suburb canada with western internet exposure until he was a middle to late teenager - I can totally see him watching Ricegum or Idubbz and a vid probably exists of him being a money hungry clout demon for jokes. Trying to explain why he's screaming about Supreme or making fun of 12 year olds on musicaly or vine to a Korean general public would be funny af alksjlfkjasld like accidental bullying???</p>

      <p>ok the prediction wasn't even pointing towards this but just to touch on it I doubt Matthew watched idubbz that's for white boys rice gum yes but everyone's watched rice gum. He gives Minecrafty jacksepticeye markiplier prob some niche Canadian YouTuber watcher I don't think he ever did shit like that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he just doesn't seem the type I've seen old pics from his sisters vsco and ik she ran him
