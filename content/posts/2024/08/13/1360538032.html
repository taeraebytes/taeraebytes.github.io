      <p>Chanyeol might actually do good - his biggest scandal of cheating on his gf of 3 years died down/was partially disproven so people aren't actively against him anymore. I feel like we should be a little more worried for all of his scores except physical sales. This comeback for Le Sserafim will either ruin them for the rest of their run or be the bounce back of all lifetime so you can't really draw expectations yet. Jaehyun we don't gotta worry about and I refuse to recognize PLAVE</p>
