      <p>Hanbin said todays stylist was the one who styled him for the star level test, I‚Äôm not sure if all the trainees had the same stylist or they used their own/ styled themselves but I hope they work with this stylist again because these fits were way to good for a festival</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure they were all styled by different people everyone got smth diff but yea they should def work with these stylists again they finally didn't look a mess. I actually think they don't have a set stylist like they do makeup artists we need a team asap
