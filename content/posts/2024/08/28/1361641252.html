      <p>It looks like there's no base/bar post so this was some group of fans personally sending it out and funded it themselves

      <p>i lurk on cforums that definitely would have discussed this and i don't even think they know a truck was sent out ðŸ˜­ whoever sent it out didn't post anywhere i think it's only made it to twt and i haven't seen anything about it on weibo so yeah seems like some random fan sent it out</p>
