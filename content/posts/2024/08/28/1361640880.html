      <p>some weibo gossip but the melon pages are saying that dispatch is getting ready to expose another female idol and they think it will be karina level again, some said winter, wonyoung, sullyoon but nothing definitive yet (the page i read had predicted aespa x actor dispatch news) apparently to cover up the issues going on rn in korea?</p>
