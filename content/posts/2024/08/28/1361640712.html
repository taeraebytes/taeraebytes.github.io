      <p>I canâ€™t respond the the cc about the truck but Iâ€™m a rosin and the second hand embarrassment was too much like why would they do that. Do they know kfans are lashing them now ? And laughing at them?. For good reason too because hao has amazing lines like I was really happy he got intro chorus verse and a bridge part and then they go send a truck when thereâ€™s literally members who are getting nothing like why do you do that ðŸ˜­</p>
