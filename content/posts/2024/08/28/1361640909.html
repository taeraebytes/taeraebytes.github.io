      <p>Can we send trucks to WK1 or trend tags to tell them to ship the fucking 1M albums they're saying because the shipment is too slow that hanteo is embarrassing ZB1???😭
Lesserafim is coming and there's one era where they had over 1M 1st day sales. We might not win anything like the crush era if wakeone don't ship those albums</p>
