      <p>Idk if anyone will know much about this but when jaehyun and Sohee had cbs they were given extra seats in the mc area because there groups were having mini fan meetings (iirc) I think it was like 60-70 seats but thereâ€™s been no notice of extra seats for zb1 but they asked for questions on mnet plus so I assume they are having a mini fanmeeting</p>
