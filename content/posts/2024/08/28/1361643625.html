      <p>I'm a day late too srry and I tried my best to listen to this unbiased and just purely how good it sounds to me in terms of vocals, song structure and personal taste

Kill the Romeo - at first I thought ktr was gonna be at the bottom cause I did not like how uncle sang it in the album sampler but after listening to it I understood the mickey mouse vibe like it fits LMAO I just love this song and the structure, maybe it's because of Im Suho who has worked with us since debut but it's like he understands and brought the best out of the members therefore turning a good song into a good ass song

Road Movie - another shocker for me, song is soooo good, different vibe from everything we ever had but I love the rap and then the angelic vocals, the balance is really good. 

Good so Bad - song is a good song but it gives 'could be better', gonna bring back Im Suho here but the difference between this song and ktr is every part in ktr feels like its written and meant for the member singing it but for gsb there are parts like the first verse where I think someone else could've sang it better etc.

Insomnia - I really like it, gives anime and sailor moon vibes and honestly pretty equal to gsb but if I were to only choose between insomnia or gsb for tt I'd choose gsb that kinda thing

Eternity - a good bside I like it too

WALL 

Bada - Not Korean so I don't feel the nostalgia ðŸ˜­
YuraYura - Japanese version eats

basically best bsides we ever had and deserves gp recognition, I'm just so happy with this album</p>
