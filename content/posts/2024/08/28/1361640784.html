      <p>it seems like his type of voice is liked in kr? at least that’s what allins always say and idk if i can trust them considering all other claims they make but idk his voice is not bad, it’s pleasing to the ear but i feel like we have multiple members with nice full or distinctive tones and i wish we could hear them more but only hao and sometimes taerae get to sing, which yeah i hope they do as mvs, but also since their songs are always so damn high i guess only a few members can actually sing them which is dumb</p>
