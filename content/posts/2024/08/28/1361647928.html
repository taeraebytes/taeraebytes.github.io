    "question": "Ik we shit on Jiwoong constantly and it can get overplayed af but there’s like a dimension of sympathy I have for him too that makes me super frustrated. Like, being constantly over sexualized since 18, facing SA from an old company, and now that his reputation is ruined, the only thing he can do is play up on being the “sexy hyung” figure and slut out, wearing see through clothing and being the most revealing member by far. Like, I’m sure that’s gotta feel shitty sometimes, that his only value is the thing that’s been pushed upon him in super uncomfortable situations. And even if he can’t sing and his dancing is usually doing too much, the fact he’s been actively trying to be an idol for about a decade is a lot too. I don’t like his personality, I hate the way he interacts with the group, I think he single-handedly stifled the success of the group and likely the success of several members post-disbandment, but I feel bad for him. Post disbandment he’ll do what? Go to the army, which is known for hazing and cruelty and it isn’t the little “healing vacation” some delulus think it is. Then he’ll likely return and maybe try a solo digital that will flop. He’ll return to being an actor, acting with a stiff face and unnatural expressions, causing him to get shitty roles or repeat characters in low budget shows. He’ll eventually be forgotten and fade away from the limelight. He’s worked his whole life towards a career momentarily supported by fujoshis who insist he’s gay and infantilize him by only talking about how dumb and goofy he is or only talk about him being sexy and kissing men, and that’s it. That’s all a decade of work will do, especially since his January controversy. It’s just so 😭 sad? These aren’t even insane things to predict, it’s what’s most likely to happen, which makes me sadder.",
    "reply": "yea I can understand all that and I do feel sympathy but all the other shit he does on top just makes me not extend it he shows no remorse no effort no relationships I'm pretty neutral on him at this point and I take both sides into consideration but from what we're being shown in the present it's not looking too hot Godspeed to him tho post disbandment I don't wish any bad on him he most likely gets paid the most in the group too like oh ok u got all the bread 😒 but this is just funny lmaooo https://files.catbox.moe/22xwfd.png"
