      <p>Sorry but using line distributions from that one yt account that botched most of the distributions when actually fan cuts of his lines are a lot diffrent is weird. I’m not saying he didn’t have a lot of line but he didn’t have the big diffrence like people make out e.g 40 seconds in ktr is just not true 🧍🏾‍♀️. Also they didn’t really gag him when the question was asked months ago and this poster is saying it like hb consistently receives the most lines in all their songs when that isn’t even the case.</p>
