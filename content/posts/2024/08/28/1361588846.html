      <p>I get that Kenzie is a seasoned producer and many of her productions have a skew going on, but i dont understand this wave of people assuming that producers all have final say in line distributions in most if not all scenarios. That's literally just an assumption extrapolated from idek a few instances where that was more or less confirmed to be the case? But just bc it's sometimes true doesnt mean it's always true. I think people just run with this idea when it's convenient for them and bc it sounds logical if you turn off your brain and willingly forget that basically nothing in kpop is purely meritocratic.

Plus the whole logic of the lines always going to who sounds the best doing them is also just bs, especially in songs where their tones are flattened in production to the point you can't recognize who's singing. Like every song's gonna have filler lines that literally anyone who isnt mute can sound 'good' on, yet somehow even those end up going to the same people. And well there's no point going line by line saying who would sound better or worse since it's subjective but producers or management definitely make some bad judgement calls and have biases unrelated to some mystical objectivity on what sounds good (not even singling out zb1 here, i have this thought listening to many groups).</p>

      <p>I agree like everyone's just using this story to justify or make sense of the distribution when for sure wakeone still has the final say like we can't just end it at this when we discuss it doesn't stick
