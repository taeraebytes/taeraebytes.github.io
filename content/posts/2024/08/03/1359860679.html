      <p>I honestly just thought his face was a little blotted I didn't even notice anything I think a lot of anons have body issues cause even how people hyper criticise Matthew's looks etc it's like they look good lol</p>

      <p>any angle that was low you could rlly see the migration ngl it's kinda bad but that's only if ur looking from that specific angle but maybe he isn't feeling well also cuz that just worsens bloat like usually I don't agree cuz ppl will just pile onto anything but this was noticeable to me but I said he didn't look bad I saw other good fansite pics

      <p>Maybe cause I didn't see any low angle but rlly I don't wanna seem dumb but I was like this just look like he hasn't dieted lately ðŸ˜­but idk much about surgery, I hope he didn't botox he's too young for that, I did and rlly regret it</p>

      <p>he's never had a double chin or a super puffy face so it's obv not that even if he hit some crazy sodium that wouldn't happen im positive it's migration they tend to overfill his chin a lottt at times idk if it's Botox I doubt honestly because he's not rlly freezing his muscles

      <p>They need to let his chin go bro his natural chin was ok and also from my own experience too I did it when I was super depressed and exhausted and I guess I thought it'd make me feel better Hao if you're going through a mental health crisis DONT DO BOTOX!!!THIS SHIT ISNT WORTH IT!!!!</p>

      <p>I think it's just filler considering he goes back to the clinic routinely WE LIKED THE SKINNY IMPLANT PLEASE GO BACK TO IT ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they're just making him look bloated this all comes back to the shitty yuehua work
