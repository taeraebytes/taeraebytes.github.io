      <p>Based on numerology, here are some duos that may face challenges or conflicts. Again this is not like they hate each other or can't adjust with each other it just that their stars doesn't seem compatible with each others.

Han Yu Jin (3/20/2007) and Kim Ji Woong (12/14/1998)
Kim Tae Rae (7/14/2002) and Park Gun Wook (1/10/2005)
Zhang Hao (7/25/2000) and Kim Gyu Vin (8/30/2004)

Jiwoong has good star compatibility with hanbin and Matthew.</p>

      <p>I think Gyuvin needs someone like him tho cause Hao has strong boundaries and I think can tell him straight up if he's crossing them which is why he said gyuvin has grown a lot lately, it's interesting that they got very close fairly recently</p>
