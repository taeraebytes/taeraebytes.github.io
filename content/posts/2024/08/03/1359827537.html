      <p>whenever i see ricky getting shat on for his makeup there's a bunch of arab fans going off at him like why is he so hated by them üò≠ like no offence but is it traditional gender roles being more upheld there....? i saw him getting hate for his makeup in the pic with kim soohyun but this is the best it's looked in quite a while like nothing was unmatched and i don't think he looks 'overly feminine' either</p>

      <p>arab culture is pretty conservative yea but they've just chosen Ricky as a target and most of them are stays and armys like alright buddy but it's just that his eyes are accentuated and his features are naturally striking and sharp they don't like that ig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's nothing over the top but obv kim soohyun has that barely there actor makeup and Ricky just looks better than him tbh

      <p>I'm arab and on arab ktwt.

but sometimes things does escape arab ktwt and reach the gp and yes sadly traditional gender roles is the standard, men should be manly men who does all the hard labor, arm full of scars and calluses from the 'hard' labor in order to put food on the table and women should cook and do house work type of bs. BUT a lot of young women and children both males and females are fighting against it rn

as for ricky he is gaining a lot of arab supporters from the new young gen of arab kpop stans who gen like him for who he is and they're actively fighting these hags because all these hags hating on him are mostly from straykids and bts era, he is also gaining sympathy fans too because I think arab kpop stans that aren't armys or stays are finally tired of their bs for running arab ktwt like it belongs to them because they know their fandom is huge compared to smaller kpop groups.
