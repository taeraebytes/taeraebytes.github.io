      <p>I feel like they would send some ateez members so they do archery, same with jype they will probably send Ryujin/Yuna/Yeji to the archery competition so they can do some articles about itzy visuals and hype up their comeback a little and if itzy really is in the gutter right now I could see them sending Charyeong for dance sports, and Enhypen for archery too lol.</p>

      <p>tried to find a clear vid of taerae running outside of the in bloom mv and the __ bad film and this is all i could find but he seems pretty fast? unless the way the cameraâ€™s moving is just making it seem heâ€™s going faster than he actually is
