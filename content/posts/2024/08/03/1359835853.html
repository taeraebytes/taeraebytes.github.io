      <p>How vile allins used to be towards gunwook like how vile yall are towards hanbin in the present time?? Ok. Just days ago yall were discrediting his singing, anons here make fun of his appearance and behavior every other day, and don't deny i remember the things yall said and it used to be worse, the expose threads are there. Don't go on your moral high ground when yall are the same hating mfs just for another member.</p>
