      <p>i’m a first time concert goer and the zb1 con in sg will be my first con, can u or any helpful anons give me advice if i should get vip seated or vip standing? the price doesn’t matter as i have a job and have been saving for this. i was planning on vip seated but seeing all the clips from people in barricade makes me feel fomo although i’m not certain i can get barricade and i’m worried i’ll be stuck in the middle or end up standing at the back since i saw some tiktok vids that said standing was their worst experience? :( note i’m around 5’4”… i know a friend going for vip standing so we could line up together but i’m still not sure if standing is worth it</p>

      <p>hmmmmm are the benefits the same for standing and seated? If you do end up doing standing I think you'll be fine for your height it's average and I doubt anyone super tall would be there my opinion is to go for standing lol it's just what I would do and I just checked the venue yea do standing 😭😭 it doesn't look like the capacity is that large and the back of the standing pit is where the front of the seats would be so it's not any different. I think you just need to be smart about timing and lineup with your friend people end up pushing towards the front anyways plus standing pen A/B looks rlly good all around too!
