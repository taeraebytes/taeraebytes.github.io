      <p>I'm literally scared that the next show is gonna blow up cause it's always the second season that blows up the hardest after the ogs laid the foundation ðŸ’”</p>

      <p>nah the bg industry is dying because no good male trainees wanna audition so bp was essentially the miracle lineup they'll probably hand out the poopoo platter

      <p>boys planet was that second season that blew up girls planet was the foundation laid ðŸ˜­ it's never happening again and there's a oversaturation with survival shows as well because of boys planet's immense success people are already sick of them</p>

      <p>If thats the case then what about pd48 and pdx101? They were all hyped and look at the success of bp even after people swore not to look at a Produce group anymore. Obviously x1 was a more popular than zb1 but theyre not far off. People will always watch survival shows cause theres always demand for it</p>
