      <p>Random but I was rewatching the long haohaos good times and idk if it was because in comparison the two other long episodes were with haos close friends but you can tell he's awkward with Matthew still ðŸ˜­I really thought they would've vibed more</p>

      <p>yea they never really seemed close or anything but I feel like if they had the chance to like being forced to spend time with each other it would be a cool vibe but they've obviously found their likes in others

      <p>I think haos the kind of person who's cool w everyone but only really close to a select few, even with members he's cool with like taerae gunwook Yujin there's a sense of distance, I think he struggles with emotional intimacy and super touchy people like Matthew he didn't really know how to react to how touchy he was and got shy a lot(sorry I can't help but psychoanalyse zb1s relationship I'm a psychology student ðŸ¤§)</p>
