      <p>oh its crazy upick deleting fraud votes bc baekhyun fans were able to close a 30 million gap in one day with hao and it was getting suspicious so now they deleted half of it after getting called out apparently they are trying to have only a close gap to force fans to spend more ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
