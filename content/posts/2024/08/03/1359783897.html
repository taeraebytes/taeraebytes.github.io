      <p>lmaooooooo did you see that translation of that theqoo (?) post that said it was 'rumoured' that smngg would be a mix of 9muses, rainbow and pristin? ðŸ˜­ sounds extremely unlikely and even if they were the inspo for sm it probably wouldn't be executed all that similarly bc those are smaller/older groups and they just won't have that essence</p>
