      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>people kind of just put the clout over potential regression which makes sense because if you're talented and no one cares and your group flops and you disband early you dont get much out of it but you can get dragged for being untalented and be in one of the most popular, heavily invested in groups with a ton of fans and content to keep them happy i feel like anyone would choose that. especially if it's someone who isnt an idol for the artistry of it all</p>
