      <p>GEONIHANI ANON HERE making an appearance after i retired for a while bc people were finally appreciating the duo. but overall omg I don't get why people have to be negative all the times when it comes to this duo. People need to accept that allins will never like Gunwook and all they are doing it's giving fake sympathy just bc he compliments Hanbin, those people are akgaes and they are not real with what they say but even besides this every member have akgaes, Matthew akgaes are the same, Ricky akgaes are the same, Hao akgaes are the same, etc. I don't get why it's wrong to like Geonihani just bc allins are the way they are, that won't erase the love that they have for each other. Gunwook really likes Hanbin and viceversa, that's a real brotherhood and you guys don't need to bring up Allins to put down the duo lol.</p>

      <p>I think you misunderstood nobody was putting the duo down it's just everyone got mad at an anon saying allins like gunwook and that it isn't something superficial basically saying the agony was fake like it wasn't... we all saw. Akgaes praising gunwook because he praised hanbin isn't some feat that's rlly all no one mentioned the duo rlly there were other anons who like it that complained as well that's not what anyone was saying ðŸ˜­

      <p>Tbh i was hurt on how you guys painted allins as a whole. I am an allin but gunwook is my 2nd pic and like him since bp. I am one of those who hurt seeing allins agkae attacking gunwook and gpds attacking hanbin but that doesn't mean we are all the same. But if you think like that well I can't do anything about it. I am not saying this for trying to change the image of us in your head but I just want to say that not everyone of us hated gunwook even before. You all are just talking about agkaes but some solo out there still likes gunwook including me. My adoration for gunwook and hanbin won't still change even how worst those agkaes acting. If i hated gunwook then i shouldn't have voted for him in some polls and updates myself and try my best to cast my votes so he can win in voting apps and etc. If I hated gunwook then i am not one of those allins solo who were defend him in our own sf and i also dm some and block them when things got worst. If all allins hated gunwook you wouldn't have seen some of their interaction in allins tl whether gunwook complimenting hanbin or just their little interactions with a sweet caption. All sfs have agkaes and they are loud to the point we can think that it was all of them so i can't also blame you guys. But again, i am saying this to clarify that someone like me really likes gunwook even if he doesn't compliment hanbin. Also the reason why I am here bcs you like gunwook and this is gpds cc but wnvr i saw hate or insult cc towards hanbin i just left and wait until it buried here so i can't see it.</p>

      <p>I'd really love to see the gpd attacks........ because I was waiting for them too it never happened LOL but how people view allins shouldn't affect u that's not ur identity uhmm ðŸ˜Ÿ but people can acknowledge two things at once not every allin is a horrible person but a lot were or are im glad you like gunwook that's nice theres loads of gpds that have hanbin as a second bias im not rlly sure what ur getting at ngl..... but this isn't rlly a gpd cc either I'm just the owner and gunwook is my bias ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but good for you most of us dislike allins it's not rlly gonna change sorry but that's just generally and just like allins rosins wdgs even riyangis like uhmmmmmmm if the cc wasn't about things u do ur aight....... ðŸ˜…
