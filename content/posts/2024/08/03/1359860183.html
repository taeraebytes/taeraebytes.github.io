      <p>maybe cause I remember there r some fansigns' repos that members said they don't allow to post freely and only post with timetable or something like that in last year? But I think they can post now whenever they like.</p>

      <p>it was them saying they had to do rotations and that was before there was bubble/pluschat and they weren't as active on ig it made sense since they'd just be spamming the twitter page there was obv restriction in the beginning but it hasn't been there for a long time
