      <p>aww seeing briizes converting here is cute af ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but as a multistan who has briize moots they're not all insufferable the insufferable ones are the sm stans and ex boysplanet watchers who are STILL holding onto a grudge for their 1pick not debuting like I'm pretty sure some @'s are already poppin up because they always in our shit on twt and the funniest thing is most zeroses have these insufferable losers who dont got nothing going on in real life blocked but they make burners so they can see our stuff and what were up to and camp all our shit to qrt something hateful like its so pathetic and theyre 16 or something like they really be spending their precious youth camping a group they do not like to qrt what probably is their insecurities for some likes which is just so cringe</p>

      <p>Diff anon and clock it. Some of the stuff they QRT are so specific that it has to be projection & they don't even realize it and try to play it off as trolling but nahhhh I think you just hate yourself or struggling with something so when you see X do the thing they can't they legit tweak because why are you so persistent it's been a year ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>yupyup just ignore these cringers ðŸ¦†ðŸš¬ 

if you look at their moots and who they interact with its the same type of insufferable trolls doing the same thing so that says a lot about them. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't like each other tbh but they have no choice but to be moots because their fandom clearly doesn't fuck with them and these types of cringers are the loneliest irl so if their only choice is to be moots with bottom of the barrel type of trolls then that's what they'll do</p>
