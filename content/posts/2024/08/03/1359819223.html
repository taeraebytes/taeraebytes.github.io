      <p>yea they never really seemed close or anything but I feel like if they had the chance to like being forced to spend time with each other it would be a cool vibe but they've obviously found their likes in others

      <p>I think haos the kind of person who's cool w everyone but only really close to a select few, even with members he's cool with like taerae gunwook Yujin there's a sense of distance, I think he struggles with emotional intimacy and super touchy people like Matthew he didn't really know how to react to how touchy he was and got shy a lot(sorry I can't help but psychoanalyse zb1s relationship I'm a psychology student ðŸ¤§)</p>
