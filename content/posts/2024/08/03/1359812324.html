And other than yujin, gunwook is also one who really follows hanbin really well as their leader and his hyung. This actions of gunwook, how he really respects hanbin made me realize that hanbin treats him really good cuz if not he won't act like this. He really trust and respect hanbin the reason why he can't speak informal to him. The thing he said in mcd that hanbin and other 2 hyungs that he can't really speak informal with, hanbin looked at him (jokingly sulk) and gunwook says if hanbin doesn't like it that he didn't use informal words to him like he is saying \"hyung i have respect on you too much that i can't really speak informal to you\", thats what i feel it. Now i wanna cry rmbrng thoseüò≠ I love mattparkz but I love whnvr hanbin and gunwook tgthr cuz i can really see how gunwook is at ease with him like he doesn't needs to worry cuz there is hanbin who he can really depend on in so many things. Matthew is a hyung but his a foreigner maybe the reason why gunwook can't depend on him most of time",
