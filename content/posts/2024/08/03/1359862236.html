      <p>Like you'd think the airport means some downtime maybe a nap on the plane since its a short flight or even relax and not think but hell nah these xhs girlies gonna follow him every step, 10 phones all up in his face and his sasaengs taking the same flight gonna be making up all sorts of excuses to walk up and down the aisle to sneak a peak at him in his seat</p>

      <p>once i saw on xhs this lady who was on the same flight as him and she said some fansites created a scene on the plane for the seats or something like that my memory is not that good, but i genuinely felt horrible. i know it's not the same thing at all but i was also a victim of stalking for a while and i'm well aware of how suffocating those kind of situations are. i know that's how it works unfortunately and we can do nothing to change anything but it just makes me so sad every time i think about it... exchanging his freedom to be an artist</p>
