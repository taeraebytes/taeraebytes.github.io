      <p>GEONIHANI ANON HERE making an appearance after i retired for a while bc people were finally appreciating the duo. but overall omg I don't get why people have to be negative all the times when it comes to this duo. People need to accept that allins will never like Gunwook and all they are doing it's giving fake sympathy just bc he compliments Hanbin, those people are akgaes and they are not real with what they say but even besides this every member have akgaes, Matthew akgaes are the same, Ricky akgaes are the same, Hao akgaes are the same, etc. I don't get why it's wrong to like Geonihani just bc allins are the way they are, that won't erase the love that they have for each other. Gunwook really likes Hanbin and viceversa, that's a real brotherhood and you guys don't need to bring up Allins to put down the duo lol.</p>

      <p>I think you misunderstood nobody was putting the duo down it's just everyone got mad at an anon saying allins like gunwook and that it isn't something superficial basically saying the agony was fake like it wasn't... we all saw. Akgaes praising gunwook because he praised hanbin isn't some feat that's rlly all no one mentioned the duo rlly there were other anons who like it that complained as well that's not what anyone was saying ðŸ˜­
