      <p>Ugh I hope someone asks him again in fs so he knows the demand is hereüôèüôèüôè seriously I don't want to make it seem like I'm above other fans (I am) but i can't believe no one asked anything about producing and lyrics writing to the members like that's something they've mentioned several times I wanna know if they have some projects, especially Gunwook since I'm really curious about what his beat selection is gonna be</p>

      <p>Taerae, Gunwook and Hanbin have written before right 
Matthew wrote the little intro on the trailer which isn't a song but it's still interesting 
Shimkongz have composed and written a song yes it was mid but the desire was there
I think Hao mentioned he wanted to be a producer? And said he wanted to compose a few times 

That's literally all members besides Yujin and Jiwoong like I doubt they'll have the time but there does seem to be a wish to be more creatively involved it kills me that no one asks them about thisüíî</p>

      <p>yea that's about right most of them wanna try immersing themselves it's surprising no one asks like I get the first timer fancall/fansign fans getting their moments but to the people who enter every day please switch it up

      <p>not doomposting, just saying in general

if zb1 was permanent their growth would be so insane because they already grew so much in one year and mesh together so well it's honestly so crazy to me how far they've come together as a group in such a short amount of time despite all their obstacles</p>
