 The quotes on this tweetðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Didn't I tell you allins like gunwook now. And it is not because of just him praising hb because if hao did the same, no one will be moved</p>

      <p>I just saw 3 people in the quotes who used to bully gunwook severely ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.. I'm over it now but some of those people in the quotes dead used to attack his character and spread rumors mi cyant forgive that the others are fine but it's definitely cuz gpds are doormats and gunwooks praising hanbin lol

      <p>Anon There are actually loads of normal us  allins who love Gunwook and always have but sending it here is a bit weird like you donâ€™t need to â€˜proveâ€™ you like Gunwook just donâ€™t be an asshole about him ðŸ˜­ and  you definitely donâ€™t need to prove it through a post of him praising hb like you shouldnâ€™t ONLY be nice when heâ€™s hyping your bias . Also sending a post with known akgaes in the quotes is definitely a choice</p>
