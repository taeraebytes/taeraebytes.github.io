      <p>I think they get paid very well not super rich (besides Ricky Yujin and Gyuvin obvs) but very well off and you can tell approximately when that happened and they got their first pay cause shimkongz used to have to pay for their groceries, their gifts for ep minus the rich members were really cheap, Hao literally only wore fan gifts and his old clothes etc and now we Hanbin buying a studio for his sister, very expensive gifts for eo even casually, Hao actually wearing his own unprompted clothes and they're pretty expensive like his fits can cost Like 2k sometimes which isn't outrageously expensive for a celebrity but they clearly financially expanded</p>
