      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>this kills me bc it's not that she regressed or anything it's just that izone never sang live, and she was doing the same with lesserafim until unforgiven era on where they started singing more live and then everything went to shit.</p>

      <p>Idk why they were like ohmmmm we should give them a live stage bc when newjeans did lolla they were technically live but they had a backtrack that was way louder than their voices aka what lsf did during the 2nd week of Coachella and they did sound decent but of course that the damage was already done</p>
