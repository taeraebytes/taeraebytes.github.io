      <p>ngl it’s getting tired how many non zerose ifans have so many opinions on ricky and it’s all just because he’s really good looking and uses a lot makeup 😭 i like him but im borderline solo of a diff memeber so i don’t even see a lot of stuff and like ok the makeup is a little weird sometimes and he obviously tries to uphold a very specific image with his visuals and style but idk people are really doing too much on him 😭 and also the perception is so different between nonfans and zerose</p>

      <p>I don't mean to compare or say it's the same cuz it's not but they're basically treating Ricky like wonyoung in the sense of general popularity but also extreme hate from random people who don't even remotely like their groups. Because he looks different from ur average bg idol it just fuels people to hate more people hate on wonyoung for no reason and only because she's this successful and pretty Ricky defintely doesn't go through an ounce of the extreme misogyny she goes through or even the same amount but they both get hated for having attention from randoms I haven't seen a hate agenda for a random idol like that in a while
