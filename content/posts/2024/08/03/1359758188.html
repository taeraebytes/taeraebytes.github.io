      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>honestly kpop fans are so harsh with her, sheâ€™s genuinely a hard worker she is trying to get them right, her dance was average before and now she dances amazingly. but vocals are just not okay and thats fine cause nobody asked kpop idols to all be singers</p>

      <p>they need to clarify her position as solely a dancer firstly cuz it doesn't look like she'll ever get better at singing probably not even stability either now that she's traumatized

      <p>it's that new gen thing where they don't specify positions so their fans go around calling everyone an all rounder but we need positions back fr it kept things REALISTIC</p>
