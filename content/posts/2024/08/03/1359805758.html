      <p>Outside of the fact that they're fake AF cause several of these people swear by twobinz and Yujin but I've seen them say vile shit about them or throwing them under the bus to defend hanbin RECENTLY as a human being I really do not understand why we must be glad that those people are praising gunwook like outside of the stantwt a big chunks of these solo allins have been like, violently racist and homophobic? This does nothing to me</p>

      <p>Personally my wish from the beginning was for these people to ignore gunwook I don't want their praises or their duo recruitment like alright that's enough now we don't want it
