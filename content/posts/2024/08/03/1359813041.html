      <p>I feel like they would send some ateez members so they do archery, same with jype they will probably send Ryujin/Yuna/Yeji to the archery competition so they can do some articles about itzy visuals and hype up their comeback a little and if itzy really is in the gutter right now I could see them sending Charyeong for dance sports, and Enhypen for archery too lol.</p>
