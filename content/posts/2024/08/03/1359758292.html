      <p>I keep seeing the ISAC line up and who is even doing break dancing ðŸ˜­. 

I know KIOF company will make natty do some dance sports bc they want that vitality, Xiaoting will probably repeat again, and for the boys I am guessing that the nugus will participate.</p>

      <p>break dancing like such an interesting category I wonder why it was even added idols most likely can't pull it off so maybe it's for fun

      <p>Checked the line up and my predictions for breakdancing are:

Emma from badvillain 
One of the &team boys 
One of the nct wish boys (I am saying those two bc we know japanese people don't play about dancing like there has to be at least one member that gets down)</p>

      <p>also i saw that young posse was there and bc of their goofy ass concept i just know that their company will have one of them doing breakdance.

for dancing sports my guesses are Xiaoting, Natty, Tsuki, and if Nmixx wants to get serious they will send Kyujin instead of Sullyoon, maybe Lightsum will send Sangah and bad villain might send another member that isn't Emma, I could also see Wooah Nana participating here.</p>
