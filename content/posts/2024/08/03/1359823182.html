      <p>whenever i see ricky getting shat on for his makeup there's a bunch of arab fans going off at him like why is he so hated by them 😭 like no offence but is it traditional gender roles being more upheld there....? i saw him getting hate for his makeup in the pic with kim soohyun but this is the best it's looked in quite a while like nothing was unmatched and i don't think he looks 'overly feminine' either</p>

      <p>arab culture is pretty conservative yea but they've just chosen Ricky as a target and most of them are stays and armys like alright buddy but it's just that his eyes are accentuated and his features are naturally striking and sharp they don't like that ig 🤷‍♀️ it's nothing over the top but obv kim soohyun has that barely there actor makeup and Ricky just looks better than him tbh
