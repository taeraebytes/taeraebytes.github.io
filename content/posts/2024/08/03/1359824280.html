      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>this kills me bc it's not that she regressed or anything it's just that izone never sang live, and she was doing the same with lesserafim until unforgiven era on where they started singing more live and then everything went to shit.</p>

      <p>For Sakura I'll add that her voice is extremely shaky naturally like even she just talks, I think she needs both speech correctement lessons and vocal lessons because I haven't seen anyone in the industry with a similar issue</p>
