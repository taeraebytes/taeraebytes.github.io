      <p>now that the sakura docu singing thing has died down a bit and in my unbiased opinion I think there's something physically wrong with her vocal anatomy ðŸ˜­ I'm not trying to be mean and I do feel sorry for her, you can tell she wants to improve but she just physically anatomically cannot like do you get me?</p>

      <p>honestly kpop fans are so harsh with her, sheâ€™s genuinely a hard worker she is trying to get them right, her dance was average before and now she dances amazingly. but vocals are just not okay and thats fine cause nobody asked kpop idols to all be singers</p>

      <p>they need to clarify her position as solely a dancer firstly cuz it doesn't look like she'll ever get better at singing probably not even stability either now that she's traumatized

      <p>Kpop idols are selling music!!! The min requirement is they should be able to carry a tune!!! They arent backup dancers to just dance wtf. They cant do the minimum but want to earn millions? They should be criticised for not doing the basic!!!</p>
