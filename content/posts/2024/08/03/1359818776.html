      <p>My take for zb1 western songs cover stages
Jiwoong - yeah usher idc
Hao- Crazy in love, Beyonce 
Hanbin- Womanizer, Britney spears 
Matthew - Blinding lights, the weeknd Maria I'm drunk idk what else do they have in Canada 
Ricky- paper soldiers Brent faiyaz
Gyuvin- I just wanna rock IDK!!!
Gunwook - for singing rapping he could go for streets or like that by doja cat and rewrite the rap OR make full self written rap song for the beat I'm seeing the ms fat body-surround sound sample, or any kind of boom bap hip hop beat for gunwook tbh he really gives ny to me
Yujin- Sorry jb</p>
