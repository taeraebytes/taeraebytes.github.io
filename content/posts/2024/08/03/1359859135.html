      <p>I honestly just thought his face was a little blotted I didn't even notice anything I think a lot of anons have body issues cause even how people hyper criticise Matthew's looks etc it's like they look good lol</p>

      <p>any angle that was low you could rlly see the migration ngl it's kinda bad but that's only if ur looking from that specific angle but maybe he isn't feeling well also cuz that just worsens bloat like usually I don't agree cuz ppl will just pile onto anything but this was noticeable to me but I said he didn't look bad I saw other good fansite pics
