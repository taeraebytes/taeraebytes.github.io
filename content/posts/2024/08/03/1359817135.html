      <p>i keep seeing ppl make parallels with bts/enhypen/txt and it's pissing me off like do these ppl not know how kpop stans are?????? do they not recall pre-crush when matthew spoiled some sort of choreo that lasted 0.5 seconds and engenes decided they were plagiarising bite me?????????? u point out similarities or an 'ult interaction' and BOOM lawsuit (well not quite, that's a bit dramatic, but ykwim) ðŸ˜­ zeroses are so dumb. at least with the txt one a director for one of their things worked on the cinema paradise video so that makes sense</p>

      <p>exactly, hell we shouldnt be even promoting comparisons with even our own labelmates but here goes my moot making a thread for zb1 and kepler comparisons, she had to get a report for that shit. cause nobodyðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ is going to be praising zb1 or treating it as cute, the only thing close to alliance we have are onedoors who are begs of the century and kiof stans like we really rnt working with much...</p>

      <p>Do allins think...zeroses don't talk about daechinso every week too Lord maybe if y'all got out of your cultish retarded bubble you'd have a better vision of the fanbase, the members you constantly mischaracterize and maybe even gain critical thinking skills and stop being so damn corny and cringe</p>
