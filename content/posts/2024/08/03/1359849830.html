      <p>This is like for next year but I just deeped that since zb1 contract finishes like really early January we probably won‚Äôt get like final cb and promo close to that date but rather in oct/nov like crush since December and a lot of Jan will be swamped with award shows. This reminds me of ioi where there last public appearance as a group was an award show and all the girls were crying when they accepted the award üò≠</p>

      <p>They are defo extending i mean even ex kepler members company 143 had negotiation with wk1 that they would only leave after a final japanese concert was done, i have no doubt it will be the same for zb1. but i wonder if they will make it international or if their last visit to lets say the US will be a random kcon date</p>
