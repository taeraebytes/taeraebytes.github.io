      <p>The way your anons start to tweak and bring up whatever akgaes have said about Gunwook whenever GuniHani is mentioned... There are fans who genuinely like the duo and have not shitted on the other. Itâ€™s looking more like these people try to undermine whatever bond Gunwook and Hanbin have ðŸ˜’ Gunwook is one of Hanbins fave dongsaengs and Hanbin probably is Gunwooks fave hyung within the group... LET US EAT IN PEACE</p>
