      <p>ugh wish hanbin would bring back his ballroom roots for this and give us a viral moment like he‚Äôd have to suffer being called a gay boy but the clout would be so lit if he wins</p>

      <p>anon the isac ballroom in question is the latin influenced type not the type that was done in new york gay clubs in the 80s üò≠ unless i'm misreading what anon is saying..... and i mean there is that one video of him doing the other ballroom but like that's different to his usual stuff</p>

      <p>That's what I'm thinking too üò≠ but someone said he's done cha cha cha before but like that wouldn't give him enough of a reason to train for a short period of time on top of what he's already doing

      <p>Anon he actually did that kind of ballroom too, not professionals levels but if he participates he would definitely win bc there's no other idol with that much ballroom experience participating except Xiaoting but they divided the categories into male and female so they won't be competing for the same award.</p>
