      <p>its so funny they always get accused of being an akgae just because they mostly only speak up about ricky on the yejigf acc but like theres a clear difference from an akgae and a ot9 that focuses on one member acc cuz thats basically me, im ot9 but my twt acc is just gunwook and i only rt stuff related to gunwook or when interacts with members but doesnt mean idc or hate the members 😭

but yeah they do collect everyones pc i rmb awhile ago someone accused them of being an akgae and they busted out their binder of their zb1 pc collection like i get theyre annoying but theyre far from an akgae</p>
