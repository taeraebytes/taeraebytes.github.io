      <p>yall gotta differentiate between being more known / having the most fans, shotaro definitely is the most known especially since he debuted earlier but wonbin has the most fans in the fandom</p>

      <p>Shotaro similar to nmix haewon they have their own audience that hype them watch their content but not dedicated enough to follow their group 
his fancams always have the most views and he gets his cheers in those multi-concert</p>

      <p>True she has a really funny/witty personality i watch some of her youtube shorts (she's all over kr yt shorts) I think having a refreshing variety personality will def make the gp interested in you. This is why companies need to be smart on who to promote to the gp to help get the group's name out there.</p>
