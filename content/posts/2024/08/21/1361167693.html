      <p>They will probably make it work and have him attend both but I can’t understand why they can’t bring in special MCs when it’s just jaehyun or just Sohee. When they both jaehyun and Sohee were busy they had Yujin and Gunwook as special MCs but when on of them is busy they will always try and pull him back to mc e.g when they were doing concerts in Japan im pretty sure it was only jaehyun mcing so they flew him back for les than 24 hours to mc, and tomorrow riize has their Japan concert so again he’s mcing with jaehyun but why not call in special MCs ?</p>

      <p>I think it was just a special occasion for when gunwook and yujin went and obviously hanbins favored out of the three so getting something special like that is just better? easier? idk
