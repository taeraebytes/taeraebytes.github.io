      <p>Even without a scandal he's gonna regret doing all this in like a few months 😭😭😭 Fueling parasocial-ism this early on and to this extent is just a sasaengs dream and he's only gonna gain more sasaengs and esp the more crazy ones. I wouldn't be surprised if his 'normal' fans become sasaengs because of what's hes enabling 😭</p>

      <p>on the topic of that i feel like zb1 kinda fuel the parasocialism a bit much at times too like i thought they were getting better but then the digimonz live happened and they were fully talking in english about ideal dates and which member they'd recommend for their daughter to date like i couldn't take it bc i just can't with bf/gf stan stuff, i find it cringe, and it's worse hearing it in ur native language rather than having to go through subtitles so i turned my volume all the way down 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i hope they chill on it a bit bc as anons have been saying, whenever that happens i just picture their future dating scandals like "oh no"</p>

      <p>nah that's really standard stuff like a little parasocialism doesn't hurt and the point of their existence is to sell a fantasy to their fans 😭 zb1 used to be clocked innnnn but not rlly anymore it's regular stuff now it's chill the crazy fans were gonna exist without it anyways and this type stuff doesn't come back to bite them in scandal cuz it's part of the job riku is doing smth else entirely

      <p>Diff anon and playing devils advocate because I kinda get what that anon was trying to say but they just suck at talking LOL 

Okay forget about Korean fetish but something else is there because what's the difference between hearing it and reading it if the meaning is the same? It's not like Matthew and Ricky aren't native English speakers and are forcing themselves to speak English hence making it cringe, English is their prefered language to communicate in and what they're most comfortable in between the two of them so I get you find the gf stan talk cringe but saying hearing it in English makes it worst is... weird.</p>

      <p>😭😭😭 I get anons point tho they just find it cringe and it's worse to hear than read it's not that it's cuz it's English or Korean it's what they understand
