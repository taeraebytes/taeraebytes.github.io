      <p>Stan twt acting like demure is something that you understand only being chronically online kills me bc that shit is everywhere like you even have the Kardashians using it. Being chronically online would be knowing what the hell is that skibidi toilet meme but they act like demure is something that only tiktok creators are doing.</p>
