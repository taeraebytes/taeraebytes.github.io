      <p>yall gotta differentiate between being more known / having the most fans, shotaro definitely is the most known especially since he debuted earlier but wonbin has the most fans in the fandom</p>

      <p>Shotaro similar to nmix haewon they have their own audience that hype them watch their content but not dedicated enough to follow their group 
his fancams always have the most views and he gets his cheers in those multi-concert</p>

      <p>people exaggerate too much when their best charting song was love me like this and it's not like their next songs did bad either ðŸ¤£ they were never in the trenches in the first place and with sullyoon having that face card they will never be</p>
