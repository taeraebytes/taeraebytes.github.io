      <p>no they mentioned some have been punished according to law for contacting the members illegally and trespassing and they collected a lot of evidences of illegal posts online to submit for legal punishment. they will continue collecting evidences of anything posted online that breach members‚Äô rights (honor, personality, privacy, etc..) basically saying watch out or you‚Äôre next</p>
