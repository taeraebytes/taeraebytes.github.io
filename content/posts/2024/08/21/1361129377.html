      <p>To me TWS members have more lows than nct wish but their highs are higher than nct wish highs. Like Dohoon, Shinyu, Hajin >>> Yushi, Sakuya and Sion</p>

      <p>When nct wish debuted I thought they will be nugu but now it seems like every other 5th gen bg is becoming more popular than our zb1. Tws is still so confusing to me though, they don't seem as popular as others but their songs go viral.</p>

      <p>They'll get there soon though. While zb1 only gets ignored except when they drag jw. No matter how great zb1 is, people don't seem to want to tune into them at all. And these bnd demons are pissing me off, they should've never gone viral. They think they are the kings now.</p>
