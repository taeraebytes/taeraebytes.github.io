      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­i always thought gyubrik would remain somewhat niche but now their cfanbase is big enough that they are regularly putting out ads and fanprojects like wow congrats gyuvin</p>

      <p>There was a voting recently and gyubrik came very close to haobin in number of votes. They may overtake if gyuvin continues with the fanservice because haobin isn't growing.</p>

      <p>they have and they're becoming big in china thanks to shimkongz yaoi bait. there're tons of gyubricker attend fansigns especially in china you can see from their material in chaohua with many interviews from both of them. they also become haobin with their answer about each other.</p>

      <p>I meant in the answers they give and also the narrative that their fans like to give them that it's literally a copy paste of what haobiners say about them</p>
