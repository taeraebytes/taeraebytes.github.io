      <p>how does this make sense like it wasn’t matthew that shamed gaeul and then turned around and said elegant to Ricky for the same thing how is there a double standard the situations are so different saijsndjodsnkd plus eating pizza with cutlery is more  or so than how they ate that burger</p>

      <p>Eating pizza with a knife and fork is actually the traditional way and how italians eat it, even in the states if u go to a fine dining restaurant that serves pizza people eat it with a knife 😭</p>
