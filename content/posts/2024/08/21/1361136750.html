      <p>if you're talking about what i think you are anon that's just a normal advertising post for a new survival show starlight boys which is part of the youth with you series. lee sungkyung is the confirmed mc and it's common for weibo accounts to post random unconfirmed names to build hype around the show so this time they mentioned yuqi and hao as possible mentors. 

it's like that one post from another show a few months back youth periplous or something idk if you remember that had listed a bunch of chinese kpop idols to generate hype even though they weren't actually coming, so even though it would be cool if he mentors i'd be interested to watch any of the zb1 members mentor since they've been through survivals already but it's too early to say if this is true i think with their schedules it would only be possible if the show is filmed in korea.</p>
