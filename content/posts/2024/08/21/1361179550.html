      <p>Doubt anyone he will probably go to both. Mca will probably finish around 7:30 and the kwda venue is just up the street and apparently there is no artist seating at kwda so they will all just be in waiting rooms till they perform</p>

      <p>Yeah the venue is Jamsil arena which is literally 12 minutes away by car but tbh it would have been better for him to only attend one rather than both.I can’t understand why they would double book him like that in such close proximity too when they are probably being run down from cb prep anyway</p>

      <p>Not directly about his but it has me thinking mnet aren’t letting him miss mca while they are on tour like it doesn’t matter if they have a show every weekend I can guarantee if he’s not got a show on Thursday they gonna make him go mc 💀 this is where I think about that anon who said he’s going to end up injured 😭</p>

      <p>I thought they would tbh but after this double book yeah there’s no chance 😭 if he’s in kr he’s definitely going. In that sense yujins really lucked out that concerts are on Saturday/ Sunday</p>
