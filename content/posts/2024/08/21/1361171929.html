      <p>Doubt anyone he will probably go to both. Mca will probably finish around 7:30 and the kwda venue is just up the street and apparently there is no artist seating at kwda so they will all just be in waiting rooms till they perform</p>

      <p>Yeah the venue is Jamsil arena which is literally 12 minutes away by car but tbh it would have been better for him to only attend one rather than both.I can‚Äôt understand why they would double book him like that in such close proximity too when they are probably being run down from cb prep anyway</p>
