      <p>Cause I was just thinking about baejin leaving cix and how produce trainees most definitely sign artist contracts meaning unless their contracts get bought out like chaewon and Sakura (could've been minju too smh) or their contracts get extended like kep1er they will spend 4 more years w their og company..is it the fate of each member</p>

      <p>Jellyfish verivery has fantastic music like layback, tag tag but they are still nugus because their company is horrible in promoting them and they don't have money as well. I'm worried for gunwook SMH.</p>
