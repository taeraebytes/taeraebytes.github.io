      <p>Gunwook Yujin got very interesting dynamics yujin definitely put gunwook higher on list because he tries to copy or imitates a gunwook a lot, but it looks like it oftens get overshadowed by mattwook ship. There is one more video where gunwook trying to teach yujin how to use cutlery which is so freaking adorable but those video always get overshadowed by yaoi shipping.
