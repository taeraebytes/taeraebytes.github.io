      <p>There is a picture of Hb floating around (Ngl the first time he has looked handsome) where you can see his side profile and on the third pic of the tweet you can see some kind of a scar in the middle of his upper lip... I wonder what that scar is for üßêüßê Do you think its a Botox or Filler scar?</p>
