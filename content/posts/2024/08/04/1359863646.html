      <p>Gunwook Yujin got very interesting dynamics yujin definitely put gunwook higher on list because he tries to copy or imitates a gunwook a lot, but it looks like it oftens get overshadowed by mattwook ship. There is one more video where gunwook trying to teach yujin how to use cutlery which is so freaking adorable but those video always get overshadowed by yaoi shipping.

      <p>They just need content together cause Wakeone always separate the groups and put the same people together in situations where they don't interact much anyways, it's crazy how for every problem I offer the same solution but we would appreciate the group sm more if they had better ot9 content and at least some lives thatd be better promo than most of the things they're doing rn so they could work less for better results</p>
