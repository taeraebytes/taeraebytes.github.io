      <p>Queef also I want to vent out all point which I discussed with numerologist and kept in note

Based on their numerology charts here's a prediction of who might face criticism for their acting.(if they ever get into acting career):

1. Ricky - With a Life Path Number 6 and Destiny Number 3, Ricky might face criticism for:
    - Overacting or being too dramatic
    - Struggling with complex, nuanced roles
2. Kim Ji Woong - Kim Ji Woong might face criticism for:
    - Being overshadowed by more experienced actors
3. Zhang Hao - With a Life Path Number 7 and Destiny Number 5, Zhang Hao might face criticism for:
    - Being too introverted or reserved in his performances
    - Struggling with emotional expression and depth
4. Sung Han Bin - With a Life Path Number 9 and Destiny Number 6, Sung Han Bin might face criticism for:
    - Being too serious or brooding in his performances
    - Struggling with comedic roles or timing</p>
