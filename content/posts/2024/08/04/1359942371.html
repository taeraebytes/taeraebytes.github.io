      <p>Hello, queef. I'm not that numerologist, I consulted numerologist, I mentioned zb1 member a couple of times to them that they got irritated and they said numerology depends on multiple factors they predicted this on based on data available on the internet like dob and zodiac sign and queef I don't want people to start fighting based on this prediction, so I mentioned entertainment purpose because in the end, it's God who decides every destiny, not numerologist</p>
