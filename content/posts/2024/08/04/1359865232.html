      <p>ugh wish hanbin would bring back his ballroom roots for this and give us a viral moment like he‚Äôd have to suffer being called a gay boy but the clout would be so lit if he wins</p>

      <p>anon the isac ballroom in question is the latin influenced type not the type that was done in new york gay clubs in the 80s üò≠ unless i'm misreading what anon is saying..... and i mean there is that one video of him doing the other ballroom but like that's different to his usual stuff</p>

      <p>That's what I'm thinking too üò≠ but someone said he's done cha cha cha before but like that wouldn't give him enough of a reason to train for a short period of time on top of what he's already doing

      <p>Anon he actually did that kind of ballroom too, not professionals levels but if he participates he would definitely win bc there's no other idol with that much ballroom experience participating except Xiaoting but they divided the categories into male and female so they won't be competing for the same award.</p>

      <p>I feel like you can tell he was way more fun and wild predebut tho like Matthew explicitly said it but I get it if people shitted on your art and way of expressing yourself so massively id be traumatised too and he generally seems to care a lot about what people think of him I genuinely think he needs therapy cause he clearly has a lot of inner struggles I feel bad</p>

      <p>I agree and I also think people are quick to glaze over the fact that in bp he literally introduced himself as a professional whacker like he wasn‚Äôt ashamed of it or shit that dance battle with lip j was great. But after that ep aired a lot of his past videos were dug up and he got ALOT of homophobic and fatphobic remarks and then after that the dance battle with haruto got cut ( and by harutos own words it was a lot of whacking and dipping). I think rather than trying to change himself he‚Äôs obviously trying to protect parts of himself that have been attacked like members have said he teaches them whacking, we‚Äôve seen him whack in behind the scene contents but honestly I think as long as he‚Äôs an idol it‚Äôs not something he‚Äôs going to do openly simply for the fact there will always be people making homophobic remarks towards him about it.</p>

      <p>Yes I'm very critical of Hanbin on some aspects but I do feel very empathetic towards him that's his art and his way of expression, probably something he felt very deeply emotionally connected with that got shitted on I think that really hurt him to his core, I also joke and say that his gay ass need to get over himself but objectively having something That you love be so publicly humiliated hurts</p>
