    "question": "Armageddon is considered Hip Hop soul (which is a genre that’s actually been picking up some momentum in kpop, it might be the next big thing after drum n bass. Genre cycles in kpop usually last 2-4 years, such a tropical house back in 2016-2020). Hip Hop is not just trap beats or fast pace rapping, and honestly I think a really good hip hop release that showcases the genre getting more popular came from Hyunbeen’s new group “ArRc” or however you spell it with their song “Dummy”. It’d be interesting to see ZB1 try to go something that’s edgier than normal and I could see them testing it out considering the youth in the shade trilogy is done and this is a new creative cycle for them. The only members I can see struggling with pulling it off is Hao, Taerae, and Ricky. Yujin is 50/50 and Jiwoong is either going to be super cringe and doing too much or like perfectly acclimated. Gunwook would shine tho frfr and Hanbin/Matthew would do great too. Gyuvin would be there but might fade into the background.",
