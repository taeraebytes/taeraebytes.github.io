      <p>Tbh honest I don't even rank them anymore, its bias and then really like, like and don't care 😭 not liking one person in a group is so exhausting so uncle is just there and ranking them is hard cause as time goes by u really start to like the members for who they are and numbering them is just another uneeded stress I love our jebis</p>
