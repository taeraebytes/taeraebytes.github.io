      <p>Theres a chance that gyuvin could be richer than ricky but we dont know since his lifestyle was a bit more modest (despite gyuvin taking luxury bags to school)</p>

      <p>That's true it wouldn't surprise me Ricky does give heavy new money vibes but since Ricky's family are most definitely millionaires how rich could Gyuvin be</p>
