      <p>Cause I was just thinking about baejin leaving cix and how produce trainees most definitely sign artist contracts meaning unless their contracts get bought out like chaewon and Sakura (could've been minju too smh) or their contracts get extended like kep1er they will spend 4 more years w their og company..is it the fate of each member</p>

      <p>Yuehua career prediction:
Lots of investment on their debut, good a&r high quality MV
Not really supported by the kside but they're doing fine and have a good ~2 cb
Hao or Gyuvin or Yujin get into a controversy 
The bg is put on "hiatus" hariboz are sent to do activities in China 
Yuehua puts new trainees in another survival show
Yhnbg gets shelved and everyone is forgotten and leave after 4 years
This is the life of everyone under yuehua..PLEASE SOMEONE TAKE HAO HES TOO TALENTED FOR THIS</p>

      <p>Based on numerological prediction mentioned below in cc, after yeuhua bg flopped, yujin will turn 20 or 21 they will pushed him into acting I guess? Yeuhua korea has good reputations in acting industry and hao probably will do drama in China, and gyuvin start podcast.</p>
