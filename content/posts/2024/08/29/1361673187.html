    "question": "yeah i think the instagram acc that has been posting abt him stalking and threatening her is probably real but i haven’t seen anything verifiable about her age and there were ppl claiming its a male minor which the police came out and said was false. also theres so many different claims abt what the crime itself is whether its molka or sexual assault or both. they’re releasing the details tomorrow apparently so we’ll see.",
    "reply": "I'm seeing a lot of claims people saying he never got into an accident but it was the victims grandfather that beat him up? I hate when people swirl misinformation into serious cases like time and place... but yea I don't see why the ig acc wouldn't be real I hope the details keep the victim hidden at least I doubt it'll be anything super clarifying but it's smth"
