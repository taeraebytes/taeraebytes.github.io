      <p>Bad news is that, our only KBS shows are 2D1N and that Hanbin-Gyuvin guesting. When we won last FTP because we had Lee Mujin, 2D1N, Eunchar diary, Superman and another one I forgot. Lesserafim will get the win if we don't do radio guestings</p>

      <p>But the digitals data that music shows use come out on Thursday while Lesserafim comeback is on Friday, no? So for mcountdown, the show and show champion they won't have digital points.</p>
