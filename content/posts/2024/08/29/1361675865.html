      <p>some weibo gossip but the melon pages are saying that dispatch is getting ready to expose another female idol and they think it will be karina level again, some said winter, wonyoung, sullyoon but nothing definitive yet (the page i read had predicted aespa x actor dispatch news) apparently to cover up the issues going on rn in korea?</p>

      <p>no cover up will do anything this nth room 2.0 has gotten so big that if u throw a female idol under the bus ur just asking to go bankrupt and lose all public trust. i heard the reason korean news arent talking about it is because this nth room 2.0 goes deep that not just students use these rooms but teachers, professors, day to day salary men, pedos and even gov't officials</p>
