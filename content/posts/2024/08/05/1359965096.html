      <p>Sjsjskks y'all are OBSESSED with Evnne. Crazy when a group who's only skill is making money is intimated by a group with talent. Happens every kpop generation. Don't be embarrassed of your dozens, just accept it 🩷</p>

      <p>I'm aware it's a joke they're also not impressive enough to boost seungeon with a vocal trio like how strong haorae and gunbin are LOL and exactly
