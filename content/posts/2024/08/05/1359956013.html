      <p>Am I the only one that always knew that Wakeone would give them food and drinks? It's just that they were telling them to also bring water in case they wanted more bc of the crazy heat</p>

      <p>They quite literally said we are not providing food or water so... what were people gonna think ðŸ˜­ I personally think it was some kind of weird clout chasing tactic not a heads up cuz the stuff looks thoroughly prepared
