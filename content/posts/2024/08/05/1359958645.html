      <p>Well they did a collab / ba? With dr.g and then itâ€™s their own merch and other brands they did collab with so wakeone may do the same for the ending gift for zerose e.g give out colourgram, medipeel ect. Itâ€™s all marketing in a way and these brands will usually sponsor these gifts.</p>
