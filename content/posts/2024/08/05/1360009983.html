      <p>Not sure what you’ve seen yet but I’m sharing these bc they’re code-worded on instiz so a little hard to find. Pretty much everyone there who isn’t a deranged wish akgae (who seem to be gaining notoriety on the k-side) or a pre-established troll is sympathetic to gw bc it’s blatantly obvious there was no malicious intent or even personal fault in him falling and the person in front of him falling too, whether it was due to accidental contact or the faulty tarp. I know I’m preaching to the choir here but it’s kinda tragic he’s so regularly beat up and genuinely degraded by trolls on that side to the point where non-fans know it and pity him and even expect it while still calling out the illogic and extremeness, and meanwhile I-zeroses are completely oblivious and useless acting like he doesn’t get hate and protect accs devote all their time to calling out fans for being the decrepit age of 21 or not freaking out over stupid easily disprovable piercing rumors.

      <p>so far I've seen the track video and the fans fighting each other I'm actually surprised this time around gunwook was being defended by zeroses it's usually so heartbreaking whenever he gets a lot of hate nobody defends him. I've seen the apology video getting a lot of good attention and mostly it seems to have calmed down but I'm still just upset because no matter what gunwook does there will always be people waiting to jump him literally the same could've happened to anyone else the reaction would've been different just like how that nct wish sion guy pushed someone on accident ppl sided with him and said the issue is isac but when gunwook tripped and scraped his arm he gets the worst things said about him😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑. But you're right his hate train is so recognized most people can already predict what people will do to ridicule him over small shit like it's that known it's almost every fucking week omgggg and ifans rlly don't have a clue that's why I was always so sensitive to shade gunwook would get on the iside and start fighting w ppl LIKE THESE HOES REALLY DONT HAVE A CLUE......... ugh it's just so upsetting im glad normal people understood and stuff but damn gunwook will get attacked for nothing for eternity huh
