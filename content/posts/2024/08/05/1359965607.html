      <p>Sjsjskks y'all are OBSESSED with Evnne. Crazy when a group who's only skill is making money is intimated by a group with talent. Happens every kpop generation. Don't be embarrassed of your dozens, just accept it ðŸ©·</p>

      <p>I had to giggle so hard idk whose lying to you but no one not one damn zerose is envious or wish zb1 was anything like evnne. The most noise they made was when park hanbin said he blocked zb1s socials because he didnâ€™t make it into the group for pity points.</p>
