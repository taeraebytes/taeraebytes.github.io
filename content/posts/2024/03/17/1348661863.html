      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly hao‚Äôs project got approved even tho they denied it before üò≠</p>

      <p>the double standards is as clear as day this isn't the first time they rejected support projects for hao when zh cbar is the first to request, iirc wasn't there something similar that happened with their mic supports too? wk1 basically ignored zh cbar's countless emails about a mic project for months but approved other member's mic project within few days of requesting it</p>

      <p>It‚Äôs always ‚Äúwe only accept group projects‚Äù when it comes to Hao but the second it‚Äôs another specific member it‚Äôs perfectly fine to do a solo project. It‚Äôs so blatantly obvious what they‚Äôre doing.</p>

      <p>I feel like u have to rmbr that zhbar is always the first and earliest to do a project for hao so they probably become more lenient when another project follows suit like I rlly don't think it's as blatant as that but idk
