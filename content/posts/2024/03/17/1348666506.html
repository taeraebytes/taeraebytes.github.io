      <p>Ngl at the beginning I started biasing Hao, Hanbin and Gunwook but lately I feel so detached to Hao and Hanbin bc of how those fans act like god they never smile, they are never happy, they just complain and fight and omg I am so tired of them. I still like the two of them but I feel so detached from them bc i can't even fangirl about them anymore bc those other fans are nasty and boring too.</p>
