      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly haoâ€™s project got approved even tho they denied it before ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>the double standards is as clear as day this isn't the first time they rejected support projects for hao when zh cbar is the first to request, iirc wasn't there something similar that happened with their mic supports too? wk1 basically ignored zh cbar's countless emails about a mic project for months but approved other member's mic project within few days of requesting it</p>

      <p>Yea we talked about the mic issue in here they requested the project pretty early like fall 2023? But cmiiw didn't hanbins also have issue reaching wk1 too there is probably favoritism tho

      <p>Yeah hanbinâ€™s cbar was also contacting them from December 2023 and they only posted about the timelines after people started making their own narrative about it. This also doesnâ€™t make sense to me because multiple other members had their designs and things approved before him like Matthew has his hand mic already delivered to the company but no one seems to be mentioning that ?</p>

      <p>clock that like I get the annoyance and apparent favoritism but if Matthews was received immediately and before anyone else that should be brought up to bring nuance cuz I had no ideaaaaaa

      <p>This is absolutely nothing against these members but I think they just have tunnel vision on him (hanbin) because I remember when his design was approved they started saying oh they want him to have a mic first they donâ€™t want hao to be 1st ect but by that point Matthew Ricky Taerae and gunwooks designs had been approved too before hanbinâ€™s so like what are you getting mad at. And yeah total silence over Matthew reviving his mic in ear and head mic before they went to Japan it really seems like selective outrage because when you look at the bigger picture its not as deep as they make out.</p>

      <p>That's what I said too cuz I know gunwooks was approved they just hadn't started funding or chose a design ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but I got overrode and just kept it pushing like I think we need to take a step back sometimes this is crazy nfnnfndnnd

      <p>No one actually dropped the name of the cbar who got the mic approved first. Since the one who brought it up is a zhg admin. 

It's just the hanbin cbar and rosins just have a beef to pluck since they had that melon thing where they said thank you to dispatch for editing the promo photos making Hao not the center while removing gyuv on the photo ðŸ˜­</p>
