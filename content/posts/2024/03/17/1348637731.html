      <p>ricky saying he didnt wanna continue school in korea cuz he wasnt allowed to keep his blonde is such bs, cuz realistically who wants to go to school in a foreign country while being awkward and (at the time) barely being able to form a sentence in the language. not only that but koreans r sooo racist to chinese ppl</p>
