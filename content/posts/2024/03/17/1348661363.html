      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly haoâ€™s project got approved even tho they denied it before ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Actually hanbinâ€™s c bar hasnâ€™t posted anything about it ( but they have for the other ads) being approved afaik they have submitted it but they only post it on their page after it has been approved. Also these applications donâ€™t just go in and get sent back in a day they take sometimes 2/3 weeks to get replies back so they would have had to apply ages ago too.</p>

      <p>ok so there's no confirmation that hanbins support was approved? cuz I just saw the ss and that was it but then that would mean they would've applied around the same time but only zhbar was denied? And is now the only confirmed one? Ugh idk I'm confused

      <p>From my understanding working in events both would have had to apply ages ago because these ads take time to get approval and event organisers take a while to reply. Zh cbar came out and publicly said they said no solo ads, hanbinâ€™s c bar hasnâ€™t said anything but they did post about the other ads outside of the arena space ( the same as zh cbar did).  This morning zh c bar posted the statement about the non commercial ads being allowed ( to me this sounded like there was negotiation between the bar and the company) and hanbinâ€™s Japan fanbase posted a collage of the fan supports they are doing/ planning for for Japan debut and one of the pictures was an ad at the arena. But hanbinâ€™s c bar still hasnâ€™t posted this one so my understanding is it hasnâ€™t been cleared yet. Saying they suddenly approved it because hanbinâ€™s c bar applied doesnâ€™t really check out to me because both would have had to apply a while ago and it it were the case of just allowing it because they were going to allow hanbinâ€™s they would have just allowed it in the first place instead of rejecting or asking for group ads since fanbases always do solo ads.</p>

      <p>This makes sense and if zhbar is giving timely updates it's going to look different from a bar who only posts what's approved.
