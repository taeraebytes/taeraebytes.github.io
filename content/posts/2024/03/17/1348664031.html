    "question": "Lapone don’t accept solo ads at all and this is the case with their other group too its not a zb1 exclusive. If they wanted to play favourites they would have allowed individual ads from the beginning because the companies know these fans will fund solo ads however they tried to make the group ad thing work. Whether they posted about it or not it’s clear both parties did some negotiating and that why the solo ads are now approved and the lack of critical thinking is truly shocking. I ain’t shooting for hanbin like that but his fanbase always does ads if they wanted him to have solo ads they would have allowed it in the first place since his fanbase always does them for him, I don’t think this was to spite hao I think lapone were just trying to stick to their policy but it didn’t work with a group full of raging solos. Which also explains why news of both fanbases being allows solo ads is coming out on the same date because they probably emailed back one after the other. I wonder what rosins will do when they find out other fanbases are doing ads but also haven’t posted about them yet ? It’s yujins birthday soon so you think his c bar isn’t doing something.",
