      <p>Uhm no I will kill u actually when the fans put in the effort gunwook blows up effortlessly he has crazy viral potential but the problem is they don't farm likes like everyone else or promote him it irks me so muchhhhh😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 but I'm ngl and say idgy he's not popular with the gay twt community I get it but they do a better job than his own fans at getting his name out there that's my gripe UGH CAN SOMEONE PLEASE START TO CARE ABOUT HIS CLOUT💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔

      <p>The gay community it's still yearning about Jiwoong while they make jokes about Hanbin and ZH being gay, so we need Jiwoong dating rumor to come out so Wookie can take the spot that Jiwoong is fulfilling rn.</p>
