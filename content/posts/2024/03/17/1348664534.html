      <p>I honestly don't care the only thing that bothers me is they blow up more than his regular fans can these ppl get up and do smth make a thread gyatdamnnnn like it's very easy to ignore nsfw twt and I don't mind him getting likes clout is clout it's just the disparity 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and I'm ngl it does look like he's taking over the tbz members spots and it was so annoying as a deobi

      <p>ok they are gf stans but I don't think that's it they can just be rlly protective of gunwook due to his age and thirst tweets which I get to a degree it is very creepy to see how his older kfans act (HALF OF THOSE HOES JUMPED SHIP WHEN HE BECAME AN ADULT😭😭😭😭) and the wild idol shoots I get it. it can get rlly annoying tho with age policing any of his older fans that are in their early 20s and just the difference in tolerance with him and gyuvin even tho they're only 4-3 months apart. But a lot of the gpds on twt are younger than gunwook himself and just freak at stuff like but I personally don't rlly care too much because fanservice is inevitable and I don't think anything's wrong gunwook likes having that gapmoe image of being hot and cute and it works for him. It comes down to the protectiveness and also being a gf stan like jealousy comes with that and they do enjoy keeping him to themselves and I have another talking point ab how other zeroses act with him but we'll be here all day. The point is it's not homophobia it's just literally the fundamentals of being a gf fan, a degree of ownership (the gatekeeping has got to stop) and protectiveness.
