      <p>But tbh I'm not sure if it's just me becoming an adult but I feel like Kpop has fell off in general this year, like I've felt this way for a while but at least the two last year's we had ive and newjeans but now when you don't have a stan acc you never even hear about Kpop anymore</p>

      <p>its def cause of hybe and SMs weird obsession with making new nct units. the groups who are on top are all from the same company. their marketing strategies are the same. all of them debut and right away get their own  variety show yt programm. bring back the fun dorm realities or them just doing whatever they do on their day/free time. tiktok is another thing im really annoyed at cause most groups just use it to promote their song and not really do anything original and fun. the newer groups concepts are boring too. no storyline, no theories just nothing. at least give us an interesting concept. thats why i really liked enhypen bite me, it was different in concept than most releases. they couldve even went harder in the vampire concept part</p>

      <p>Hybes goal has always been to monopolize kpop and them having 1 million subsidiaries is just another factor of it. Sm has definitely made it harder for other companies to grow with their family groups and they kind of are a first emerging company in kpop but it was never like this. Tiktok has made things so annoying too like that's not content!!!!!!! And the dumb once in a blue moon videos are better than the dance challenges idc and everyone tries to make 2 minute tiktok songs... we don't want it.
