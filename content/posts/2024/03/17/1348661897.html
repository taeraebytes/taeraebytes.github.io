      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly hao’s project got approved even tho they denied it before 😭</p>

      <p>the double standards is as clear as day this isn't the first time they rejected support projects for hao when zh cbar is the first to request, iirc wasn't there something similar that happened with their mic supports too? wk1 basically ignored zh cbar's countless emails about a mic project for months but approved other member's mic project within few days of requesting it</p>

      <p>Yea we talked about the mic issue in here they requested the project pretty early like fall 2023? But cmiiw didn't hanbins also have issue reaching wk1 too there is probably favoritism tho

      <p>It’s always “we only accept group projects” when it comes to Hao but the second it’s another specific member it’s perfectly fine to do a solo project. It’s so blatantly obvious what they’re doing.</p>

      <p>I feel like u have to rmbr that zhbar is always the first and earliest to do a project for hao so they probably become more lenient when another project follows suit like I rlly don't think it's as blatant as that but idk
