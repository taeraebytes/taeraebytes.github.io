      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly hao’s project got approved even tho they denied it before 😭</p>

      <p>Actually hanbin’s c bar hasn’t posted anything about it ( but they have for the other ads) being approved afaik they have submitted it but they only post it on their page after it has been approved. Also these applications don’t just go in and get sent back in a day they take sometimes 2/3 weeks to get replies back so they would have had to apply ages ago too.</p>

      <p>ok so there's no confirmation that hanbins support was approved? cuz I just saw the ss and that was it but then that would mean they would've applied around the same time but only zhbar was denied? And is now the only confirmed one? Ugh idk I'm confused

      <p>its already approved i think since it was already included in hanbinʼs ads map. zhbar has long posted that wakeone rejected them but the arena operator themselves was the one who negotiated with w1 since NO ONE was submitting anything else for the ads inside the arena. afaik they only approved it when hb cbar also applied for it</p>
