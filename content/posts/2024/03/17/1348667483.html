      <p>Ngl at the beginning I started biasing Hao, Hanbin and Gunwook but lately I feel so detached to Hao and Hanbin bc of how those fans act like god they never smile, they are never happy, they just complain and fight and omg I am so tired of them. I still like the two of them but I feel so detached from them bc i can't even fangirl about them anymore bc those other fans are nasty and boring too.</p>

      <p>Frankly, this is me with hanbin. I can't even bother rting any post with hanbin now because of how much his fans did so many hate tweets unprovoked towards gunwook and Matthew. 

Gunwook - saying that he's not fit to be mc because he's not handsome, saying those stupid rumors

Matthew - saying he's copying hanbin, copying those plushies, saying he's being pushed so much by Wakeone since he got the ccma gig. Coming after his dancing as well.</p>
