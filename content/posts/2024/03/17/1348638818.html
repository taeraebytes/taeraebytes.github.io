      <p>ricky saying he didnt wanna continue school in korea cuz he wasnt allowed to keep his blonde is such bs, cuz realistically who wants to go to school in a foreign country while being awkward and (at the time) barely being able to form a sentence in the language. not only that but koreans r sooo racist to chinese ppl</p>

      <p>I heard he switched to an art school before he came to Korea? I don't know maybe unpopular opinion but in this day and age studies aren't everything, we have so many options now thanks to our boomer parents giving us opportunities they weren't able to get back then. My twin sis dropped out in grade 10 to draw art, whole family mad but she's making more money than my parents combines and is kinda big on art twitter while I'm still studying and in debt LMAOOO üôÉ 

So maybe I'm just biased/ protective of my sister because a lot of people called her stupid but if you know what you want to do and it doesn't require academics why waste those years when you can be working on whatever you want to do instead. My only advice is at least graduate highschool IN CASE whatever you want to do doesn't work out you have your high school diploma.</p>

      <p>It's kind of a pride thing for me like who wants to be the loser twin üò≠ üò≠ üò≠  I'm still studying and the career field I'm aiming for I know I can pay it off eventually but tbh I don't think I'll ever make as much as her üò≠ BUT she pays every time we go out cause I am broke right now.

I don't know what art direction you're trying to go for but my sis does fan art of animes and games and have them weebs on a chockhold. I don't even know how to explain it to you but she doesn't even work, she just draws and people donate to her every month it's crazy because sometimes I don't even understand it.</p>
