      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly haoâ€™s project got approved even tho they denied it before ðŸ˜­</p>
