      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly haoâ€™s project got approved even tho they denied it before ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Actually hanbinâ€™s c bar hasnâ€™t posted anything about it ( but they have for the other ads) being approved afaik they have submitted it but they only post it on their page after it has been approved. Also these applications donâ€™t just go in and get sent back in a day they take sometimes 2/3 weeks to get replies back so they would have had to apply ages ago too.</p>

      <p>ok so there's no confirmation that hanbins support was approved? cuz I just saw the ss and that was it but then that would mean they would've applied around the same time but only zhbar was denied? And is now the only confirmed one? Ugh idk I'm confused
