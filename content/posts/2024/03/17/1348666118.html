      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly hao’s project got approved even tho they denied it before 😭</p>

      <p>the double standards is as clear as day this isn't the first time they rejected support projects for hao when zh cbar is the first to request, iirc wasn't there something similar that happened with their mic supports too? wk1 basically ignored zh cbar's countless emails about a mic project for months but approved other member's mic project within few days of requesting it</p>

      <p>Yea we talked about the mic issue in here they requested the project pretty early like fall 2023? But cmiiw didn't hanbins also have issue reaching wk1 too there is probably favoritism tho

      <p>Yeah hanbin’s cbar was also contacting them from December 2023 and they only posted about the timelines after people started making their own narrative about it. This also doesn’t make sense to me because multiple other members had their designs and things approved before him like Matthew has his hand mic already delivered to the company but no one seems to be mentioning that ?</p>

      <p>clock that like I get the annoyance and apparent favoritism but if Matthews was received immediately and before anyone else that should be brought up to bring nuance cuz I had no ideaaaaaa

      <p>This is absolutely nothing against these members but I think they just have tunnel vision on him (hanbin) because I remember when his design was approved they started saying oh they want him to have a mic first they don’t want hao to be 1st ect but by that point Matthew Ricky Taerae and gunwooks designs had been approved too before hanbin’s so like what are you getting mad at. And yeah total silence over Matthew reviving his mic in ear and head mic before they went to Japan it really seems like selective outrage because when you look at the bigger picture its not as deep as they make out.</p>

      <p>Tbh hanbin cbar is not the second biggest one. It's either rk cbar or yujin cbar but gunwook cbar is able to give out more projects for Gunwook.</p>

      <p>the ones who have jp debut projects from cbar are ricky, yujin, hao, and hanbin. yujins cbar will prob most more of his bday support soon so they mightve applied. ricky bar has posted about a bunch of ads outside of the venue so idk if they would bother with applying for that. i think taerae probably has the least active cbar from what ive seen like gw and matt bar are super small but they seem like they try to do whatever they can</p>

      <p>We need him to promote with Hao in cn then. Like let's give haohao goodtime with gunwook because how tf did gunwook get 3-4 minutes promo while the new ones, Hanbin's being the longest for 13 mins while gyuvs is 7-8 minutes. 

He needs to sing a cn song and dance to douyin songs</p>
