      <p>zhbar wanted to do a project for hao (solo) for the jpn fancon like they do for every event but wake1 and their jpn company said no unless it was for the whole group. fast forward to now we find out hanbins solo project from his fan bar got approved no issues and now suddenly hao’s project got approved even tho they denied it before 😭</p>

      <p>the double standards is as clear as day this isn't the first time they rejected support projects for hao when zh cbar is the first to request, iirc wasn't there something similar that happened with their mic supports too? wk1 basically ignored zh cbar's countless emails about a mic project for months but approved other member's mic project within few days of requesting it</p>

      <p>Yea we talked about the mic issue in here they requested the project pretty early like fall 2023? But cmiiw didn't hanbins also have issue reaching wk1 too there is probably favoritism tho

      <p>Yeah hanbin’s cbar was also contacting them from December 2023 and they only posted about the timelines after people started making their own narrative about it. This also doesn’t make sense to me because multiple other members had their designs and things approved before him like Matthew has his hand mic already delivered to the company but no one seems to be mentioning that ?</p>

      <p>clock that like I get the annoyance and apparent favoritism but if Matthews was received immediately and before anyone else that should be brought up to bring nuance cuz I had no ideaaaaaa
