      <p>I hate to say it but jiwoong is so handsome irl ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è matthew is also rllllllllly cute irl like I feel like anyone that sees him would grow a soft spot for him uhmmm Ricky's head is big üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ but it was so interesting he rlly does not move his face when hes not doing anything like no thoughts behind those eyes at all. and when people say that cameras don't do gunwook Justice believe me they are right I almost fainted when I saw him like he is so pretty... but everyone looks better irl the rest I didn't see much of so I can't say but gyuvin looked cute irl icl he was so puppy like he kept waving at me n my friend
