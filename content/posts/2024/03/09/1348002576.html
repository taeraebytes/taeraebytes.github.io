      <p>I feel like they won't boycott the woongsungz magazine because it'll affect another member but ugh we need to do something to kick him out and if we want to send a strong message it's gonna affect the other members sorry his very presence in the group affects them we need to grow some spine</p>

      <p>usually with things like this it ends up that the magazine announced it at the wrong time, i'm not sure the official zb1 instagram reposted the story so if they didn't then i feel like that's an indicator that the magazine posted about it early. or maybe it was a planned thing pre-jiwoong scandal fallout and the social media intern didn't get the memo and ended up posting it even tho it was already cancelled lmao</p>
