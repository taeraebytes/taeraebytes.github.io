      <p>Not a tarot reader but after that first anon message I checked haorae astrological transits for the month now you can't really predict the future w astrology esp not wo birth chart but you can get their overall vibe 
They both mention -and Hanbin I checked-being surrounded by people with bad attentions and being careful but Taerae is mostly positive while Hao might be mentally going through it until about mid to late April a lot of frustration esp w people in power</p>

      <p>Yeah i haven't checked the other members and again the time of birth could change a lot but he has one big transit that's gonna last until the end of zb1 pretty much about struggling with people in power, ofc it could go either way but w what he sent today on bbl I think he's been frustrated and struggling a bit behind the scenes with the company, the important thing is how he'll react</p>

      <p>i think itâ€™s about yuehuas china branch wanting him after zb1. iâ€™m sure that he has had talks about his future with yuehua korea before but i feel like yuehua china is trying to make him change his mind or have maybe a contract against him. as the other anon mentioned "a higher up with power, father figure" will help him out. there is only one person that pops into my mind and thatâ€™s yuehuas current ceo (he is a male figure in power). hao obviously wants to stay in korea, it makes sense for yuehua china to take him back but he obviously doesnâ€™t want that. keep in mind that the touching bubble message from him was all in korean.</p>
