      <p>Not a tarot reader but after that first anon message I checked haorae astrological transits for the month now you can't really predict the future w astrology esp not wo birth chart but you can get their overall vibe 
They both mention -and Hanbin I checked-being surrounded by people with bad attentions and being careful but Taerae is mostly positive while Hao might be mentally going through it until about mid to late April a lot of frustration esp w people in power</p>
