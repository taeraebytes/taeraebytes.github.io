      <p>Not a tarot reader but after that first anon message I checked haorae astrological transits for the month now you can't really predict the future w astrology esp not wo birth chart but you can get their overall vibe 
They both mention -and Hanbin I checked-being surrounded by people with bad attentions and being careful but Taerae is mostly positive while Hao might be mentally going through it until about mid to late April a lot of frustration esp w people in power</p>

      <p>Hao seems to already be going through everything mentally before crush comeback with his lives. He was straight on almost crying on bbl that time or like we can clearly see there's something happening that even his members said he's dealing with something mentally that he's just pretending to smile and laugh or trying to (per gyubi) 

That's why I feel like it's a blessing he's roomies with gunwook since I feel like he's the best for that kind of people</p>
