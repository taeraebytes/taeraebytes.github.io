I can let some shade slide for the sake of variety and this IS a gossip cc not a bias cc but even then I've only blocked like 5 ppl in cc history. He has some kind of contemporary style and I think he has a good foundation if he had a presence it would be more noticed but for bp/zb1 he's good. Gunwook and hanbin are also just on another level of skill and presence"
