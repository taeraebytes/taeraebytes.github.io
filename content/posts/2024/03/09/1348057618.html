    "reply": "mmmmm I'm not befriending ppl my younger siblings age I like being the younger friend🙆‍♀️ but from what my older friends tell me they usually don't treat me that way I guess with hanbins personality it could be but I'm just saying when you look at it from my point of view who's indifferent and you also see how he is with gyuvin it's not as intimate as ppl make it seem. I'm not saying they're not close or don't like each other but it's definitely more businessy they've said it themselves they only talk about work. And my favorite duos are my favorite duos because they're the members that are closest to gunwook 💁‍♀️ to say gnhni is closer than mattwook or maknaez is crazy"
