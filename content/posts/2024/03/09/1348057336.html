      <p>girl geonihani has lore, fate included bc gw is the same age as hb sister and hb is the same age as gw brother, he was the first member that Gunwook went to hug despite having all the trainees all up on his face, cried when he saw him during the finale. Like don't piss me off and compare the geonihani real brothers duo to your cheap friendships that don't interact since months ago</p>

      <p>Yea I think you've lost it gnhni don't interact often gunwook doesn't hang out with him and he still speaks formally to him ðŸ˜­ meanwhile he spends every night with matthrw and yujin also gyuvin and even hao like he definitely looks up to hanbin and regards him as a favorite "hyung" but that's just it he keeps that barrier between them it's rlly just a cute hyung dongsaeng relationship but those other duos he is genuinely close to

      <p>You saying that gunhao is closer than geonihani is crazier. Also, Hanbin is the same age as his brother so of course it's awkward to be informal with him when he's probably not informal with his brother</p>
