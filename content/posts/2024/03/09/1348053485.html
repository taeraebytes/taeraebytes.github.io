      <p>girl geonihani has lore, fate included bc gw is the same age as hb sister and hb is the same age as gw brother, he was the first member that Gunwook went to hug despite having all the trainees all up on his face, cried when he saw him during the finale. Like don't piss me off and compare the geonihani real brothers duo to your cheap friendships that don't interact since months ago</p>
