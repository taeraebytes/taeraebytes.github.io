      <p>Don't block me but i don't see any special about his dancing, he's more like stiff, like i feel the same thing about matthew during bp but now i admit he's good dancer definitely top3, in gunwook and hanbin case i already know they're good dancers since bp, but yujin, i don't see it sorry</p>

      <p>Ok guys I don't block liberally ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ only if you say smth nasty ab gunwook I usually argue back but I just don't care to anymore. I can let some shade slide for the sake of variety and this IS a gossip cc not a bias cc but even then I've only blocked like 5 ppl in cc history. He has some kind of contemporary style and I think he has a good foundation if he had a presence it would be more noticed but for bp/zb1 he's good. Gunwook and hanbin are also just on another level of skill and presence
