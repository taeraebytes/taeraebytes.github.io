      <p>girl geonihani has lore, fate included bc gw is the same age as hb sister and hb is the same age as gw brother, he was the first member that Gunwook went to hug despite having all the trainees all up on his face, cried when he saw him during the finale. Like don't piss me off and compare the geonihani real brothers duo to your cheap friendships that don't interact since months ago</p>

      <p>Yea I think you've lost it gnhni don't interact often gunwook doesn't hang out with him and he still speaks formally to him üò≠ meanwhile he spends every night with matthrw and yujin also gyuvin and even hao like he definitely looks up to hanbin and regards him as a favorite "hyung" but that's just it he keeps that barrier between them it's rlly just a cute hyung dongsaeng relationship but those other duos he is genuinely close to

      <p>You saying that gunhao is closer than geonihani is crazier. Also, Hanbin is the same age as his brother so of course it's awkward to be informal with him when he's probably not informal with his brother</p>

      <p>Mhm idk I've never seen Koreans who don't refer to their siblings without the "hyung/noona/oppa/unnie" honorifics. Plus, Matthew and Hao are foreigners so he probably doesn't feel pressured to talk with honorifics towards them, he doesn't even has to, he probably just did it at first bc he's a polite boy. Even Hanbin dropped honorifics with Hao.</p>

      <p>huge gunhao enthusiast here i hate it when someone reduces ‚Äúgunwook speaking informally with hao‚Äù to just ‚Äúhao is a foreigner so it‚Äôs easier‚Äù uhm no that‚Äôs not the reason gunwook said he can speak informally to hao, he‚Äôs literally mentioned multiple times that he slipped into speaking informally to hao because hao is cute, and for some reason when the topic of informal speech gets brought up he always mentions hao lmao. i literally even keep track of how many times he‚Äôs said it 

- in gunwook‚Äôs bday letter to hao (‚Äúinformal speech naturally slips out sometimes with you, but it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre so cute‚Äù)
- in dicon unit content he also said smtg about nearly slipping into informal speech when hao was acting cute
- in a zb1 ig live he mentioned being able to talk informally with hao despite finding it hard to do the same with other hyungs
- in idol radio when he chose hao as rose member and reenacted their good night convo, he used informal speech
- in his bbl lives if hao randomly drops by gunwook also uses informal speech when talking to him
 - in the daechinso mc live he revealed he‚Äôs now fully and naturally using informal speech with hao despite not being able to drop to informal speech with 3 hyungs
- he also said multiple times in diff occasions that he finds hao cute, which i interpret as he doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs a big age/maturity gap btwn them, so he‚Äôs comfortable speaking informally with hao

ok sorry for the long ass cc i literally wrote this off the top of my head i dont play about gunhao best duo as u can see‚Ä¶ anons stop discrediting my fav gw duo ughüòî</p>
