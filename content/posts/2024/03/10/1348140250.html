      <p>But One thing which surprises me is an aggression towards women vs men because I don't see much aggression towards doyoung for McD AD.</p>

      <p>I mean anon did specifically mention that she's an English speaker that spends time online so there will be a difference with that but ur right there will always be more aggression towards women

      <p>Also Starbucks make a bigger commotion in the whole boycott movement. McDonald's and Coke Cola are also included in the boycott but there's not big talks about it.

And it helps that Starbucks paid celebs like Kim Kardashian to pose with Starbucks products so they get wacked even more.</p>
