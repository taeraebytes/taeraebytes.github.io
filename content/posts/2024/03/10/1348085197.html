      <p>ricky and hao are attending gucci event in shanghai. we had to cheer. its smart since ricky and hao could be with gucci in china and hanbin and another member with gucci in korea. i wonder what happened with loewe and hao tho.. did they decide to just stick to one brand? a spot right next to hanbin is free sooo 🤭 wakeone better give the fujoshis what they want. wakeone lets also try to get ricky and gunwook for calvin klein or versace</p>

      <p>Yea think of fashion ties as levels ambassadorship has levels within itself but sponsorships are below ambassadorships it's just a casual relationship
