      <p>Mhm i feel like it's hard for some members to get close with Hanbin bc they idealized him too much, especially the ones from the maknae line. I've seen some interactions with Gyuvin and even with him sometimes it looks like Hanbin is his caregiver ðŸ˜­.  And imo that's also one of the reasons why sometimes Mattbin don't give super close friends vibes despite knowing e/o for a loooong time.  Don't kill me but friendships on where you don't see your friend as an equal but you see them as a role model or someone to look up to, will never grow up to be super close friendships.</p>

      <p>I think he's establishing that professional type of relationship which is fine idk why everyone is so against it and I've seen people say hao keeps distance too which I believe he's just a more casual person. Like they're not going to find platonic soulmates or bffs in the group
