There is an entire article about him in Pann, and he lives in one of Seoul's most expensive areas. He and Woonhak are from the same area. Yujin's mother worked as company's general manager. I'm not sure what Yujin's father does. That's why gyuvin and yujin appear so relaxed. They know that even if they don't acquire a job, they have financial support.",
