      <p>don't get blocked sis don't ever play with me like that😂... but yea hes his fav hyung in the sense that hes not a hyung he's friends w it's like looking up to ur senior and having a good relationship with them. I'd rather them be close and drop honorifics and get close as people like he's done with Matthew and hao
