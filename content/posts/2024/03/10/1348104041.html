      <p>Girl Hanbin genuinely likes Gyuvin, not everything is a pr stunt. You allins and rosins need to accept that they vibe with Gyuvin lmao, like rosins be saying that Gyuvin is now close to Hao to clean his image when Hao clearly vibes with him too lmao. If Hanbin wanted to do some pr he would be talking about Jiwoong, kfans are not even angry with Gyuvin anymore bc he hasn't said anything controversial and he stopped the Gyuricky foolery.</p>

      <p>2binz we're close from the beginning it all started in bp but let's not act like the boom wasn't because of gyuvins string of scandals and trying to launch his good heart thru hanbinðŸ˜­ gyuhao I don't rlly see much ab so I cant say but it's not that it's just the fundamental of it and ig it's a popular enough duo that it's beneficial to both of them and should stay in the limelight
