      <p>Don't block me but i don't see any special about his dancing, he's more like stiff, like i feel the same thing about matthew during bp but now i admit he's good dancer definitely top3, in gunwook and hanbin case i already know they're good dancers since bp, but yujin, i don't see it sorry</p>

      <p>Ok guys I don't block liberally ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ only if you say smth nasty ab gunwook I usually argue back but I just don't care to anymore. I can let some shade slide for the sake of variety and this IS a gossip cc not a bias cc but even then I've only blocked like 5 ppl in cc history. He has some kind of contemporary style and I think he has a good foundation if he had a presence it would be more noticed but for bp/zb1 he's good. Gunwook and hanbin are also just on another level of skill and presence

      <p>Personally, I agree with requeefiem and Op both. He has potential, but he has been extremely unenthusiastic lately, which is going to cost him eventually. His Twitter engagement has been decreasing, and his birthday post has not been able to cross 10k. He used to have so much engagement in Pannchao, but it has been drastically reduced. I mean, you can't survive with a face that people will eventually get bored of. He is so young that he can still progress and be better, but I don't see that passion.</p>

      <p>Uh idk I think his visuals have been leveling up but hsi fandom is also majority young teens they don't have the power of older fans and it's concentrated to rlly only two countries but he does pretty well on tiktok. I agree tho I wanna see more passion from him

      <p>He needs to start putting effort on his fanservice, when you look at the members who grew their fanbase or kept their big fanbase all of them are the members who keep doing fanservice and interacting a lot with fans. I know that as a 16yo those things might seem annoying or boring but mhm he knew what idol life is about so now he needs to adapt.</p>
