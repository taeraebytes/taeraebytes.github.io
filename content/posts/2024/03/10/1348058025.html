      <p>girl geonihani has lore, fate included bc gw is the same age as hb sister and hb is the same age as gw brother, he was the first member that Gunwook went to hug despite having all the trainees all up on his face, cried when he saw him during the finale. Like don't piss me off and compare the geonihani real brothers duo to your cheap friendships that don't interact since months ago</p>

      <p>Yea I think you've lost it gnhni don't interact often gunwook doesn't hang out with him and he still speaks formally to him ðŸ˜­ meanwhile he spends every night with matthrw and yujin also gyuvin and even hao like he definitely looks up to hanbin and regards him as a favorite "hyung" but that's just it he keeps that barrier between them it's rlly just a cute hyung dongsaeng relationship but those other duos he is genuinely close to

      <p>You saying that gunhao is closer than geonihani is crazier. Also, Hanbin is the same age as his brother so of course it's awkward to be informal with him when he's probably not informal with his brother</p>

      <p>Closer =/ comfortable. We don't even know any stories about Gunhao since Hao doesn't talk much about the members. Except to say that gunwook is cute or gunwook did this or that.  

There's no way his formal with his hyung especially with his personality lmao</p>

      <p>We don't hear too much about gnhni either besides what they think of each other but im just saying as a fan of gunwook I think they have a closer relationship if he feels comfortable enough to speak informally and it speaks volumes that hao barely talks ab the other members but he talks ab gunwook and is seen out with him 1on1 that's just MY OPINION... gyatdamn

      <p>Oh yeah I hardly hear Hao talk about other members even on his bubble lives. Yet he keeps gushing about how cute gunwook is. 

They're perfect as roommates</p>
