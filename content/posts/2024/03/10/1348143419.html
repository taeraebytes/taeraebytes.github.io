      <p>controversial opinion but people do wayyy too much about starbucks considering the fact that the brand has no branches in israel and theyre not even in the bds boycott list.. theyre not pro palestine yes but the fact that there are brands who endorses israel and even sponsored food for the idf that get less shit is so bizarre to me. for the record im boycotting Starbucks and i 100% support palestine its just the difference in public reaction  weird me out</p>

      <p>I've seen ppl say that Starbucks isn't in the bds list? I didn't fact check myself sorry but as someone who's been advocating for Palestine since I was a child Starbucks has been brought up in boycotts or companies that support Israel FOR YEARS. I just wouldn't trust what the company says or what their current affiliations are rn just cuz it's been known for a decade almost I can rmbr my mom telling me ab Starbucks supporting Israel when I was in 5th grade. But thank you for still boycotting and supporting

      <p>As a swana person who's always been anti Israel I personally judge anyone here in the west who buys Starbucks or McDonald's but I get that the boycott simply isn't a thing in east Asia</p>

      <p>I understand that too and I understand yes there's protests and people that support Palestine in east Asia but the society operates differently and a lot of the information we get is sourced thru the internet spaces we occupy (not in my case but I feel like a lot of people have learned thru the internet in more recent years) and that's not to excuse any behavior but it adds nuance to the conversation
