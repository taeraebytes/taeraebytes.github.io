      <p>Don't block me but i don't see any special about his dancing, he's more like stiff, like i feel the same thing about matthew during bp but now i admit he's good dancer definitely top3, in gunwook and hanbin case i already know they're good dancers since bp, but yujin, i don't see it sorry</p>

      <p>Ok guys I don't block liberally ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ only if you say smth nasty ab gunwook I usually argue back but I just don't care to anymore. I can let some shade slide for the sake of variety and this IS a gossip cc not a bias cc but even then I've only blocked like 5 ppl in cc history. He has some kind of contemporary style and I think he has a good foundation if he had a presence it would be more noticed but for bp/zb1 he's good. Gunwook and hanbin are also just on another level of skill and presence

      <p>Personally, I agree with requeefiem and Op both. He has potential, but he has been extremely unenthusiastic lately, which is going to cost him eventually. His Twitter engagement has been decreasing, and his birthday post has not been able to cross 10k. He used to have so much engagement in Pannchao, but it has been drastically reduced. I mean, you can't survive with a face that people will eventually get bored of. He is so young that he can still progress and be better, but I don't see that passion.</p>

      <p>Uh idk I think his visuals have been leveling up but hsi fandom is also majority young teens they don't have the power of older fans and it's concentrated to rlly only two countries but he does pretty well on tiktok. I agree tho I wanna see more passion from him

      <p>I think it's not just yujin who is losing engagement whole zb1 are losing engagement they all used to get like 30k or 40K RT now they are barely crossing 10K, I think people collectively losing interest in ZB1, they are going kepler route.</p>

      <p>they're definitely not 1 thing u guys need to understand that Kepler only had a fraction of zb1 fame/traction at their height like I was there for gp999ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they've lost engagement but it's natural + they don't use twitter it's honestly fine

      <p>theyâ€™re not going to go the kepler route bc theyâ€™re a bg and bgs tend to have more dedicated fans but they are slowly losing casual fans. their core fan base is growing tho so theyâ€™ll be fine. album sales & tour revenue is what brings in the most money</p>

      <p>yea no surprise there like a Kepler fate is extremely hard to reach as a bg and they're still gaining fans even if they lose some
