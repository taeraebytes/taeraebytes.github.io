      <p>Mhm i feel like it's hard for some members to get close with Hanbin bc they idealized him too much, especially the ones from the maknae line. I've seen some interactions with Gyuvin and even with him sometimes it looks like Hanbin is his caregiver ðŸ˜­.  And imo that's also one of the reasons why sometimes Mattbin don't give super close friends vibes despite knowing e/o for a loooong time.  Don't kill me but friendships on where you don't see your friend as an equal but you see them as a role model or someone to look up to, will never grow up to be super close friendships.</p>

      <p>I think he's establishing that professional type of relationship which is fine idk why everyone is so against it and I've seen people say hao keeps distance too which I believe he's just a more casual person. Like they're not going to find platonic soulmates or bffs in the group

      <p>I agree about that idolising vibe with 2bin but not with mattbin tbh. They're pretty low-key about their friendship since they have known each other for years and don't feel the need to be flashy/open about it</p>

      <p>I think Mattbin are closer than a lot of ppl think it's just that their friendship is not as fresh so there's no glint for the cameras
