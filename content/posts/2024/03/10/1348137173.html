I didn't fact check myself sorry but as someone who's been advocating for Palestine since I was a child Starbucks has been brought up in boycotts or companies that support Israel FOR YEARS. I just wouldn't trust what the company says or what their current affiliations are rn just cuz it's been known for a decade almost I can rmbr my mom telling me ab Starbucks supporting Israel when I was in 5th grade. But thank you for still boycotting and supporting"
