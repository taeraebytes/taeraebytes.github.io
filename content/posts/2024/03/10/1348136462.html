      <p>When hao did tmi at weekly idol saying he accompany hanbin in paris and the minutes later you'll have hanbin on bubble talking "NO it's actually gyuvin". Until today, i don't know the reason why he did that, is he trying to say hao was lying? Idk he seems weird for that moment for me</p>

      <p>Eh basically during weekly idol Hao told the story but he only kept his part of the story and talked about how he comforted hanbin and then him and hanbin got drunk on the yacht (I am guessing that mr no alcohol or else we are not friends anymore wasn't with them during this part of the story). Then Hanbin went on bbl idk if someone asked or if he brought it up bc the episode came out but basically he said that he also wanted to thank gyuvin and that he didn't talk about it during the episode but Gyuvin basically comforted him for a while too and he hugged Hanbin for a long time.

So no he didn't say that Hao lied or anything like that. Both things happened the order was: Gyuvin comforting him, then Hao comforting him, them I guess that Gyuvin left then and the two of them started drinking until they got drunk I guess. And that's when their staff took those pics of Hao with Hanbin at the yacht on where Hao looks kinda lit</p>

      <p>non you making your own timeline anon, no one knows what happened, who comforted who first and who left. All we know is right after the weekly idol ep came out and hao talked about how he comforted hanbin and both got drunk tgt (hanbin agreed), hanbin goes right to bubble to talk about how gyuvin comforted him with no mention of hao lmao which was a little weird lmao especially since it was right after the ep came out.</p>

      <p>I feel like I usually can say what I think about everyone's personalities clearly on here except for hanbin just cuz of the harassment but now that I'm free as a bird lemme start. I'm obviously not mentioning this cuz idk idrc ab it but it's funny u say this anon cuz I'm ngl I feel like hanbin sometimes says or does things that make me go ????? Like he can be so slick mouthed omitting things or pointing out certain things and there's always some kind of destruction that follows mi don't like thatttt

      <p>I feel like ik what you mean because as much as we don't know someone's true intentions, it's very interesting that i can think of at least 10 diff incidents off of the top of my head where hb has said/done things that were just weird considering the context, and by consequence led his fans to harass/shade the other members or just be annoying, so many recent ones too but lemme not wake that tea up.</p>

      <p>I said it's my opinion and that's their opinion I'll get mad if I want to and they certainly get mad at me. The difference here tho is that I'm not trying to bring him down or be malicious calling gunwook an incel and then saying sometimes I be like "ouuu" at certain things hanbin says are also not the fucking sameðŸ˜­
