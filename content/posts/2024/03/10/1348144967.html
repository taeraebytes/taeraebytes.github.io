      <p>I've never said this cause I know y'all fw him but now that you guys are hating him let me just say that I don't understand why he doesn't get any backlash like people are more mad at his cringe obvious leeching when he's been misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and ableist like damn everything??? I get that he wasn't malicious but PERSONALLY I was already over him after the incel slang, staring at a woman's breast and homophobia combo like yeah no idc anymore...

I'm not actively hating on him I get that it's not that DEEP I just muted him and don't pay attention anymore but the fact that he got no real backlash or consequences is crazy considering the amount of things he said</p>

      <p>he faced backlash on the k-side why do you think he was so depressed in januaryüò≠ the i-side doesn‚Äôt really gaf but imo that doesn‚Äôt matter since he‚Äôs aware of what the messed up things he did and stopped behaving that way. however if you dislike him it would be annoying to see everyone speak highly of him.</p>
