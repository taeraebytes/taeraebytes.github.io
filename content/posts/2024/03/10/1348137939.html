      <p>i am an allindan and i hate the "sunghanbitna" joke they have going on or that "yaah(?) yuuh(?)" after saying the first one. being together with gyuvin does no good to hanbins reputation or image. it makes him look childish.</p>

      <p>it really does look like they will never let that joke go. everything about their relationship ties back to boys planet (reminicing about love me right, helping each other back then, sunghanbitna,etc..) it‚Äôs like they still try to hang onto that. i do not like that.</p>
