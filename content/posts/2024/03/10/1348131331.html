      <p>When hao did tmi at weekly idol saying he accompany hanbin in paris and the minutes later you'll have hanbin on bubble talking "NO it's actually gyuvin". Until today, i don't know the reason why he did that, is he trying to say hao was lying? Idk he seems weird for that moment for me</p>

      <p>Eh basically during weekly idol Hao told the story but he only kept his part of the story and talked about how he comforted hanbin and then him and hanbin got drunk on the yacht (I am guessing that mr no alcohol or else we are not friends anymore wasn't with them during this part of the story). Then Hanbin went on bbl idk if someone asked or if he brought it up bc the episode came out but basically he said that he also wanted to thank gyuvin and that he didn't talk about it during the episode but Gyuvin basically comforted him for a while too and he hugged Hanbin for a long time.

So no he didn't say that Hao lied or anything like that. Both things happened the order was: Gyuvin comforting him, then Hao comforting him, them I guess that Gyuvin left then and the two of them started drinking until they got drunk I guess. And that's when their staff took those pics of Hao with Hanbin at the yacht on where Hao looks kinda lit</p>
