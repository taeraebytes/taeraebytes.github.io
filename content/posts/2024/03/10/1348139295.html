      <p>When did 2binz become a thing? Gyuvin hops from ship to ship. I thought Gyujin was meant to be the biggest ship, but I'm not sure what happened. Even Gyuvin mentioned in Yujin's birthday message that "we argued a lot lately", and they don't seem to be close anymore. I like gyuvin he has very high energy but something is kinda off about him.</p>

      <p>very early on in bp like lmr gyuvin was talking ab how much he loved hanbin but again that could just be his over attached love bomber self. But I started seeing in influx of like "content" and hanbins equal reciprocation maybe october ish? But ngl yea I agree I think it's mainly because yujin and gyuvin have started spending a lot of time apart and with diff members they're both ppl that clicked well and gyuvin has ricky. And I think yujin and gunwook match each other more lowkiiiiüåù but gyujin are still brothers
