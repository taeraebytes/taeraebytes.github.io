      <p>I think I've sent this before on here bc I'm just lurking tbh but I get so amazed at how hard you people deep things out like things that are so banal and random and I always just take them on a surface level as they are but then I get on here and read essays about deeper meanings and idk it's interesting that you guys feel entertained by it does that make sense?</p>
