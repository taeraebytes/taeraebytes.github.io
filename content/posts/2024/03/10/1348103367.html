      <p>lol just those two screenshots caused a stir because hanbin changed gunwook's name from turtle to boy planet gunwook and explained that it was his first good impression of gunwook so his 3 cfans piss in their pants when gunwook forgets the reason. The rest mentioned that 5 other members ignored the message and one member didn't even read it. Rosin thought it was Hao and celebrated because he didn't care about the group while Ris was conflicted about whether it was Ricky who didn't see the message or not and his anti started saying he didn't care about the group, he I only care about 
 "sister in law".</p>
