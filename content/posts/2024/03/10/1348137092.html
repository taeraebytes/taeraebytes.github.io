      <p>Also Starbucks make a bigger commotion in the whole boycott movement. McDonald's and Coke Cola are also included in the boycott but there's not big talks about it.

And it helps that Starbucks paid celebs like Kim Kardashian to pose with Starbucks products so they get wacked even more.</p>
