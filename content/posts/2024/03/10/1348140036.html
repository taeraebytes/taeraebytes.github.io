      <p>I already muted Gyuvin, each of his nicknames, his emoji and all of his duo names back when he was being pushy with Ricky, nothing against him but HES TOOOOO MUCH I've never seen an idol be this pushy</p>

      <p>Same when I start disliking an idol I do the same thing cause I don't have the energy to be a hater, I used to excuse him as being a well meaning ignorant guy during incel gate but the whole Ricky thing threw me off so bad I see him in a different light and I don't catch up with anything about him at all anymore</p>
