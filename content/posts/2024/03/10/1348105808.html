      <p>Not zeroses qrting the Haobin troll tweet that rosins have been trying to get suspended since they're the ones bringing the hao rumors in Twitter. Like thank you for actually giving us information that you don't care about Hao when it's been on the list since August.</p>

      <p>diff anon here what pisses me off even more is that they assume that troll is a rosin, go to the qrts and basically all the zeroses who joined the bandwagon in ratioing that tweet are just generalizing rosins. we’re catching strays over that stupid troll when we’ve been the ones working the hardest trying to get ppl to help rnb that troll since forever. and then there’s other zeroses in the qrts assuming that troll is haobinist like at least pick a side, one min they’re a rosin and one min they’re a haobinist? this fandom is so dumb. 

all this time that troll has been tweeting the most vile and harmful shit about hao and no zeroses gaf but the moment other members is brought into the convo and made to sound like a rosin is hating on other members suddenly everyone jumps to ratio it like thanks for letting us know y’all dgaf about hao and just want to take any opportunity to hate on rosins, even at the expense of hao’s safety!</p>
