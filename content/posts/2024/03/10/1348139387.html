      <p>Maybe you should stay away from this place or stop replying if everything is clouding your judgement about anyone, for me when rosins start harassing hanbin unprovoked i stop interacting with anything about hao bc i know i am sad, angry and anything about him may accidentally make me think badly about him, which he doesn't deserve bc he didn't do anything wrong ( and no not even indirectly which applies to every single one of them) ; and after a few hours or days, when i come back to normal and start thinking normally i would love him again, like he is a cutie why would i think badly about him?
Also i don't like jiwoong's vibe and i don't interact with anything regarding him, i don't even know where his fans are</p>
