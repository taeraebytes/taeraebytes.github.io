      <p>pretty sure the post is saying that it's for mv filming so i would assume that that the set for the mv is outdoors given it doesn't look like there's any buildings around which is interesting (reminds me of gfriend time for the moon night even tho we have nothing else to go off lmao). taerae posted on bubble saying they got done filming something and to look forward to the 3rd mini album today so it adds up to me</p>
