      <p>Not a tarot reader but after that first anon message I checked haorae astrological transits for the month now you can't really predict the future w astrology esp not wo birth chart but you can get their overall vibe 
They both mention -and Hanbin I checked-being surrounded by people with bad attentions and being careful but Taerae is mostly positive while Hao might be mentally going through it until about mid to late April a lot of frustration esp w people in power</p>

      <p>Yeah i haven't checked the other members and again the time of birth could change a lot but he has one big transit that's gonna last until the end of zb1 pretty much about struggling with people in power, ofc it could go either way but w what he sent today on bbl I think he's been frustrated and struggling a bit behind the scenes with the company, the important thing is how he'll react</p>
