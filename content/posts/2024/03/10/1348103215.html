      <p>I think this is a good experience for Hao once he was able to conquer the issues he's dealing mentally right now. Especially if he wants to proceed with the path of teaching. He'll need a strong mentality since his degree is about teaching high school students too and you'll need to prepare yourself to handle those kind of students mentally and not just physically.</p>

      <p>I actually feel like if he will not become a kpop idol or d
If he's pushed to Yuehua china, he might go back to being an educator. 

But if he somehow stays to be in kr, I think we can see him be a kpop idol and be like solji.</p>
