      <p>When hao did tmi at weekly idol saying he accompany hanbin in paris and the minutes later you'll have hanbin on bubble talking "NO it's actually gyuvin". Until today, i don't know the reason why he did that, is he trying to say hao was lying? Idk he seems weird for that moment for me</p>

      <p>Eh basically during weekly idol Hao told the story but he only kept his part of the story and talked about how he comforted hanbin and then him and hanbin got drunk on the yacht (I am guessing that mr no alcohol or else we are not friends anymore wasn't with them during this part of the story). Then Hanbin went on bbl idk if someone asked or if he brought it up bc the episode came out but basically he said that he also wanted to thank gyuvin and that he didn't talk about it during the episode but Gyuvin basically comforted him for a while too and he hugged Hanbin for a long time.

So no he didn't say that Hao lied or anything like that. Both things happened the order was: Gyuvin comforting him, then Hao comforting him, them I guess that Gyuvin left then and the two of them started drinking until they got drunk I guess. And that's when their staff took those pics of Hao with Hanbin at the yacht on where Hao looks kinda lit</p>

      <p>non you making your own timeline anon, no one knows what happened, who comforted who first and who left. All we know is right after the weekly idol ep came out and hao talked about how he comforted hanbin and both got drunk tgt (hanbin agreed), hanbin goes right to bubble to talk about how gyuvin comforted him with no mention of hao lmao which was a little weird lmao especially since it was right after the ep came out.</p>

      <p>I feel like I usually can say what I think about everyone's personalities clearly on here except for hanbin just cuz of the harassment but now that I'm free as a bird lemme start. I'm obviously not mentioning this cuz idk idrc ab it but it's funny u say this anon cuz I'm ngl I feel like hanbin sometimes says or does things that make me go ????? Like he can be so slick mouthed omitting things or pointing out certain things and there's always some kind of destruction that follows mi don't like thatttt

      <p>I feel like ik what you mean because as much as we don't know someone's true intentions, it's very interesting that i can think of at least 10 diff incidents off of the top of my head where hb has said/done things that were just weird considering the context, and by consequence led his fans to harass/shade the other members or just be annoying, so many recent ones too but lemme not wake that tea up.</p>

      <p>Nah I think the main problem here is that Hanbin and Hao go and tell their fans when something is up with them, Hanbin doing that and iirc around the same time Zhanghao did that live on where he told his fans about how he fought with Hanbin like why are you even saying that shit when you know how your fans get? They be doing too much, and Hanbin should also stop getting Gyuvin added into the mix too.</p>

      <p>yea I think they can say whatever but at one point everyones gotta learn how their fans act like normal ppl won't care but things blow up so fast round these parts and then it make u think ab intentions and stuff and that's where we come in to get crazy ab itüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>Wait this reminds me of the time in a video call where a fan ( I think they were a haobinist) asked hao what he would say to hanbin in the future and hao said smth like don‚Äôt you wish you were better to me or something like that. Obviously it wasn‚Äôt said maliciously and the haobinist took it as a jokey way and he probably meant it that way too but crosins started dragging hanbin to filth for that so like another one of your anons said i think a lot of things any of the members say aren‚Äôt with bad intent it‚Äôs just some fans are not normal especially in this fandom.</p>

      <p>The thing is i don't see any of those crosins saying anything about hanbin like they dgaf or hate haobinist, but i've seen way more allins on X saying nasty things to hao over that tmi, idk there are so many cases of allins overanalyze the members act just to get a reason to be nasty like on last gunwook bubble that he's trying to say he's upset hanbin save his contact as bopeul gunwook, i've seen allins said gw was ungrateful on bubblebaseone, you want to say c-gpds started dragging hanbin too?</p>
