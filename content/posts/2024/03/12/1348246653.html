      <p>og anon here and Girl I'm a rosin ðŸ’€ he's trending on entertainment searches because of this you can check for yourself, and tbh the other zb1 members apart from hao almost never trend for positive things it has nothing to do with being relevant or having a big c-fanbase it's just people clocking them</p>
