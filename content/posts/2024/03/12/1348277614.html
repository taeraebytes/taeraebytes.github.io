      <p>ok but why would allegra post a picture of a girl holding her bfs hand on her ig?? think a little. the other girl looks nothing like allegra but that’s her whether she’s telling the truth or not</p>

      <p>Ugh nooooooo you guys are not listening to me THE RED HEAD POSTED IT ON HER OWN IG THAT WAS PRIVATE the extreme snooping to find her led to fans finding Allegra who was public and not slick at all🤦‍♀️... and the red head is actually his cousin it was a family link up😭😭😭😭
