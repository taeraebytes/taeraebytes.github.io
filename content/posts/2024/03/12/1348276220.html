      <p>Well if he's a money hungry like yall said he'll choose yuehua bcs his future will bright like a sun in China but if he's too koreaboo and choose another company means he'll wait 1-2 years prepare for another group (like chaewon and sakura  did before)</p>

      <p>I think he actually likes being an idol and there's not much of an idol industry, or a strong music industry at all in china if he doesn't find a Kpop company after zb1 I could see him go back to being a commoner, all the rest would say in the entertainment industry for sure tho expect maybe Matthew and Jiwoong</p>

      <p>If his dream was more ab being an idol which I think it is rather than just an artist then yea he might just return to being a citizen idk if he's just interested in being famous or just music

      <p>No... I literallt saw right before my eyes the rumor dropping they said those 4 based off of the promotional video and it's fake anyways but the thing about yujin and gunwook at dinner is also them just being minors it's obvious because gunwook is unaffiliated towards yh and wk1ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
