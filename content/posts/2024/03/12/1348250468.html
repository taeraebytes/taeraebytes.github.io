      <p>Theyre going to be okay this is like a cycle for boygroups, their fans will stand 10 ten toes behind them , i mean jiwoong told a fan to fuck off and suddenly 4 of his inactive fansites show support for him the next day,,,,, its just a matter of if the members feel guilty, han sohee or the other girl speak up, SM decides to punish them in some way , if nothing happens they could 10000% go ahead as normal with no reprucussions</p>

      <p>uhhhhhh zb1 got serious hits for what jiwoong did and it's going to follow them forever and its like a fandom wall... but also eunseoks situation is wayyyyyyy worse than jiwoong saying fuck ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and it's happening at the same time as another members dating scandal AND THEY ALREADY HAVE A MEMBER ON HIATUS FOR A SCANDALLLLL like no repercussions is crazy this is genuinely the worst 6 month roll out ever they're done
