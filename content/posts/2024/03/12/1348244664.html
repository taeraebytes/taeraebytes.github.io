      <p>remember when the seunghan scandal blew up and rize had a concert or comeback or something and sungchan didnt highfive seunghan in the choreo? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I rmb fans saying that sunghchan just forgot the choreo saying how theyre besties with video proofs from bts stuff but it was so obvious he was pissed at seunghan and wanted nothing to do with him. 

I always knew sungchan was the type to shade his members publicly if they piss him off</p>
