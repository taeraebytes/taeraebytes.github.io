      <p>the way gucci really dropped jw but jw came to the airport wearing hbs sweater (hb wore this back in bangkok) and the bag he bought from the first gucci event ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ just embarassing at this point. his fans are cheering tho ðŸ˜‚ 1. gucci is not going to dress him in the same thing hb wore back in thailand 2. the backpack he took with him makes no sense with the sweater and slacks hes wearing... i like to believe that gucci knows what theyâ€™re doing when they dress someone</p>
