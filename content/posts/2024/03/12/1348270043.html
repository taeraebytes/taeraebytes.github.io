      <p>the way gucci really dropped jw but jw came to the airport wearing hbs sweater (hb wore this back in bangkok) and the bag he bought from the first gucci event ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ just embarassing at this point. his fans are cheering tho ðŸ˜‚ 1. gucci is not going to dress him in the same thing hb wore back in thailand 2. the backpack he took with him makes no sense with the sweater and slacks hes wearing... i like to believe that gucci knows what theyâ€™re doing when they dress someone</p>

      <p>It also wouldnâ€™t make sense because why would the dress him in something hb has worn before and then dress hanbin in a jacket that just got released this week and a bag that no one can seem to find on the actual site ( so assuming not released yet)</p>
