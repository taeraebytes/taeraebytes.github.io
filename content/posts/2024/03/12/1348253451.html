      <p>sm is such a fucking ass for letting all these members get their privacy exposed and take lashings and aren’t saying shit.

what do think is going to happen i feel like these are the possibilities: anton and eunseok go on hiatus, they use this to bring seunghan back, the whole group goes on hiatus (would be unfortunate bc they have such good momentum), ppl actually get sued and shit gets cleared and taken down and they continue as normal (unlikely), the group diabands (unlikely too), the group ends up flopping bc of everything that’s happening</p>
