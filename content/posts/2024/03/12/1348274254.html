      <p>Well if he's a money hungry like yall said he'll choose yuehua bcs his future will bright like a sun in China but if he's too koreaboo and choose another company means he'll wait 1-2 years prepare for another group (like chaewon and sakura  did before)</p>

      <p>I think he actually likes being an idol and there's not much of an idol industry, or a strong music industry at all in china if he doesn't find a Kpop company after zb1 I could see him go back to being a commoner, all the rest would say in the entertainment industry for sure tho expect maybe Matthew and Jiwoong</p>

      <p>If his dream was more ab being an idol which I think it is rather than just an artist then yea he might just return to being a citizen idk if he's just interested in being famous or just music
