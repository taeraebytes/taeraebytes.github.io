      <p>Hanbin got posted on the official gucci ig story and don't think any creative director was present at the Korean event but he and the general manager of gucci posed together in one picture, also 8-10 fashion magazines present on the event posted about him, imo also highlighted him among most of the other high profile guests. Also imo as a rookie from a weak ass company he was treated quite nicely.</p>

      <p>He is the head of Gucci Korea, he was the head of Gucci China and Gucci Russia before and is now head of Gucci Korea which was a huge promotion considering Koreas not the worlds largest consumer of luxury goods per capita.</p>
