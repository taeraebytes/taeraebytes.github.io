      <p>This will not be newsworthy on kforum 

1. Yujin is a teenager, thus people don't give a Fuck about School Romance.

2. ZB1 and Yujin are not making buzz or important lately, therefore I don't think anyone cares.

3. I mean There are other articles earlier as well like hanbin taking girl on his car. Hao has bf and jiwoong and gyuvin has secret GF none of them remotely created any buzz lol even korean don't care about ZB1.</p>
