      <p>Well if he's a money hungry like yall said he'll choose yuehua bcs his future will bright like a sun in China but if he's too koreaboo and choose another company means he'll wait 1-2 years prepare for another group (like chaewon and sakura  did before)</p>

      <p>I think he actually likes being an idol and there's not much of an idol industry, or a strong music industry at all in china if he doesn't find a Kpop company after zb1 I could see him go back to being a commoner, all the rest would say in the entertainment industry for sure tho expect maybe Matthew and Jiwoong</p>

      <p>If his dream was more ab being an idol which I think it is rather than just an artist then yea he might just return to being a citizen idk if he's just interested in being famous or just music

      <p>but wait that doesn't make sense because he doesn't have the choice of choosing between the two since he wasn't born in korea. (Ex: Kevin from tbz he was born in korea and ppl are pretty sure he gave up his Korean citizenship) so that would mean he had to apply? Idk how korea works ik foreigners can naturalize but idk if they get actual citizenships like natives and idk if Matthew would be classified as a foreigner or native.... interestinf but since he has the Korean passport he definitely has some legal status. But that also doesn't make sense because he said if he didn't debut he was gonna go back to Canada and his old life so why would he give up his citizenship as a trainee who wasn't sure about his future??? ok now I'm confused are we sure he has a Korean passport
