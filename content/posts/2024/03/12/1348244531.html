      <p>Compared to the levels of exposure that the jiwoong incident and riizes stuff has gotten gunwooks incident was minuscule (died down quickly on the kside was up on the jside for a bit but everyone sided with gunwook he had 2 pann articles that trended for 5 hours and he trended on instiz but most people were on his side). And thanks to jiwoong pretty much forgotten it got debunked on the kside and most people moved on only trolls who have hated him for a long time bring it up and even then it doesn't get much attention so wakeone won't address it and I don't think they need to it'll be annoying to see but it's honestly fine hell live it's just smth thatll pass
