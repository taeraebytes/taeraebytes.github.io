      <p>Idk if itâ€™s for the cb they havenâ€™t released the date yet. All we know is they are going because hanbin asked jaejae to invite them and they said they would to repay him for doing the challenges with her. But thereâ€™s no actual news on when itâ€™s going to happen.</p>

      <p>I beg you watch any of his other non group things because he definitely does have playful banter with the people he works with. Also hanbin is the reason they are getting to go let him breath for once clearly she liked him / his personality enough to 1) travel to mcountdown to film those challanges with him 2) invite the group to be on her show, which mind you you canâ€™t use the mnet pull here since mmtg is an sbs show</p>
