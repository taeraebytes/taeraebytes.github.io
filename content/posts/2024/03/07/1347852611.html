      <p>Sorry but rosins are really starting to pmo saying the company hates him and he gets nothing. He’s plastered all over their ig and tiktok page, in January and most of February every other post on their social media’s was him. He had a solo magazine shoot with a big magazine in China, he had an ost and got to promote it, he went to a brand event all in 2 month. If this is the no promotion and they don’t want it then I’ll take it I’ll happily have my fave whose stuck in the actual dungeon with less than 5 schedules since debut take them. They are so happy when they get a schedule for hao but the minute anyone else gets anything they start crying about how they have nothing again. Greedy ass subfandom.</p>

      <p>that's happened alot in c-group of survival show. how center fans usually super greedy, demand all the activities and brand promo has to be given to center. and most rosin are c-rosin, they projected cpop culture to kpop, which is looked extra super greedy.</p>
