      <p>fashion editor is something else tho... thats not really related to any brand. since they will be in china it could be that they would have an interview with one fashion editor or something, which they then put in one magazine. meaning they want you guys to buy their magazine, its all about money AGAIN. wakeone probably gets half the money they make out of that magazine cause why else would they allow hariboz to hold an interview. i hate wakeone</p>
