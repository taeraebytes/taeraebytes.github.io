      <p>wakeone test the water and soft launching their future new bg. it's insane for company who should show group united/family spirit, they just let the member show his closeness with another group. but since taerae flop, most kzerose seemed don't care about his disloyalty</p>

      <p>Girl it don't matterrrrr that's not the point there's never been a point where idols show their close friendships on fan content like he's supposed to be professional it's a job at the end of the day and it's irksome to fans who don't see him have much of a relationship with his own group mates but be posted up with his friends in a different idol group and have that given to them
