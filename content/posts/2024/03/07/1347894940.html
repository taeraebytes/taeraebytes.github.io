      <p>Iâ€™ve seen a lot of kfans clocking on about how weird it is that heâ€™s constantly mentioning them. Usually in survival groups they never talk about old trainees or companies but itâ€™s like heâ€™s counting down the days till Wakeonez debut and promoting himself as still apart of them so fans grow fond / accepting of it. Soft launching if you will.</p>

      <p>well I argue he's quite close with hao as well what now and can you really. Blame him he didn't know any of these people during boys planet who'd expect him to be the best of best friends ever with some random people he's known for only a few months now lol also sorry but at least half of matthew and gunwooks friendship seems like fan service laid on very thick it's crazy to watch</p>
