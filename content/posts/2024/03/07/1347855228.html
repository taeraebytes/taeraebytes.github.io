      <p>Gucci event. I donâ€™t think this is the woman from the practice room video but definitely the same one from that Ricky London video and tbh all the boys seemed chill with her. Yeah some mangers are weird but donâ€™t start moving weird just because sheâ€™s a woman she seemed to have a good friendship with Ricky in London so Iâ€™m guessing she gets along with all of them well.</p>
