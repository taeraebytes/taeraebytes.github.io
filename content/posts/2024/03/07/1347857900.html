      <p>Gucci event. I donâ€™t think this is the woman from the practice room video but definitely the same one from that Ricky London video and tbh all the boys seemed chill with her. Yeah some mangers are weird but donâ€™t start moving weird just because sheâ€™s a woman she seemed to have a good friendship with Ricky in London so Iâ€™m guessing she gets along with all of them well.</p>

sorry can't upload pics so this was the only way but the one in the practice room is def her, body shape, hair and sitting position is all the same and yeah she seems chill with all members honestly kzeroses are just jealous/ insecure cause it's a female. They were saying how the way she sat cross legged is seducing them ?????? so you want her to spread her legs then????? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm pretty sure she's wakeone staff tho, kzeroses were saying shes korean and in her late 30s or early 40s</p>

      <p>no the staff from london was only a few inches shorter than Ricky while this girl looks below 5'3 if she's wearing taerae/yujins(?) jacket she's not gonna drown in it if she's their height

      <p>Diff anon but I agree it is her she's even shorter than matthew in that picture and she's even looking up at him. Matthew is what 5'6? So she's prob 5'3-5'4 ish and the one with Ricky was taken from above so it distorts their height.</p>
