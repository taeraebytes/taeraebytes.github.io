mbwff has a weird hate boner against gunwook and how he's interacts with fans but doesn't have an issue writing noncon ab him ain't that crazy I hate when people that already dislike him try to speak on his character like their judgement isn't clouded to begin with... like I wouldn't even go that far to talk ab him like he's some low rate hooker beggar these people need himðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
