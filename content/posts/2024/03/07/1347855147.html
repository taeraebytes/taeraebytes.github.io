      <p>Gucci event. I don’t think this is the woman from the practice room video but definitely the same one from that Ricky London video and tbh all the boys seemed chill with her. Yeah some mangers are weird but don’t start moving weird just because she’s a woman she seemed to have a good friendship with Ricky in London so I’m guessing she gets along with all of them well.</p>
