      <p>they are making up rumors about how gunwook and now hanbin probably have signed up with wakeone after zb1 just cause hanbin went to that gucci eventðŸ’€. did they forget that hao and yujin went to a loewe event one week ago? then hao also went to the cjnm movie screening... like ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ their takes are getting funny and funnier</p>

      <p>Hao always had the most lines and screentime so whatever Weibo rumor they bought over and tried to spread here never would have stuck outside their sf in the first place because if the criteria was lines and screen time then baby heâ€™s been signed since debut</p>

      <p>Hao in Wakeone with Gunwook and Taerae. Oooof this is the best news. Especially since look at how they actually promote jaehwan with so many shows, they'll always be judges in survival shows lmao. 

They're definitely different from the groups they actually manage without the survival group status.</p>
