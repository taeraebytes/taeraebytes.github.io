      <p>Sorry but rosins are really starting to pmo saying the company hates him and he gets nothing. Heâ€™s plastered all over their ig and tiktok page, in January and most of February every other post on their social mediaâ€™s was him. He had a solo magazine shoot with a big magazine in China, he had an ost and got to promote it, he went to a brand event all in 2 month. If this is the no promotion and they donâ€™t want it then Iâ€™ll take it Iâ€™ll happily have my fave whose stuck in the actual dungeon with less than 5 schedules since debut take them. They are so happy when they get a schedule for hao but the minute anyone else gets anything they start crying about how they have nothing again. Greedy ass subfandom.</p>

      <p>Lowkey feels like thereâ€™s a bit of insecurity behind being so centre obsessed, like hao is an amazing performer and he shines wherever on stage. If your that confident in him as an idol him being on the side for 1 picture or any other member having a centre moment which all produce and planet groups did they wouldnâ€™t freak out this bad. Never thought Iâ€™d say it but they are worse than kd fans during wannaone and as someone who was a wannable the whole contract period I never thought there could be another fandom worse.</p>
