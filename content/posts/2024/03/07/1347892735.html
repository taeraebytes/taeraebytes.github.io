      <p>Ok as a stantwt veteran let me five y'all some advices because I see a lot of you are constantly on the negative side of stantwt and I was there too at some point: 
-I strongly advise to hard block accs that are constantly negative and the people who interact with them, some of them are straight up evil and maybe you feel personally wronged by what they're saying or your sense of morals or love for your idol is bothered by them existing but it ultimately has no real effect and the best is to not interact with them and block any similar accs that appear on your tl

-You should also abuse the mute words button too, I irrationally dislike two celebrities to the point any good news about them would sour my mood, this is obviously not normal and it's entirely my problem so I muted every words relating to them and even emojis

-And you should also have an acc that isn't related to your fd at all so you can switch over if the situation is terrible (for ex my friend is a fearnot and has been avoiding everything about the group since the beginning of promotions lol we love criticizing but constant negativity and twiter takes is not it)

-the key here is you can love something passionately but you need to detach, it shouldn't impact your mental health</p>
