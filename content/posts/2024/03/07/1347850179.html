 mental illness and this is why you can’t convince me rosins aren’t like a cult. Sure they love hao but they love being attached to the name more because how are a lot of them agreeing to this and shading the members with no critical thinking involved.</p>

      <p>It’s true because any other produce fandom did not tweak out this bad when calling someone the centre, it’s like you have to remove that word from your language if you aren’t rosin. Because they actually believe it’s exclusive to them, it doesn’t matter if Gunwook is 5 in from the right and 5 in from the left you dare say middle or centre ( which is the correct term for where he’s standing in the image) and they act like you called hao a slur.</p>

      <p>like BITCH IMMA SAY GUNWOOKS IN THE MIDDLE IF I WANT TOOOOO come to my house and slap me about it🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ like they kill me thinking ppl on the internet can control how things work + to an outsider it's obvious he is the center it's always been the case that there's also a member with a lot of opportunities that has reach as well like all the other produce groups... the purpose of the center is to be the face and promote but not to diminish and hide the other members there's also the concern of the disparity between hanbin and hao plus the company's treatment but they've fully lost the plot and my understanding 🤷‍♀️
