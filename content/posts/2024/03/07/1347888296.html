      <p>Poor miskeen maybe I’ll say thank you this once because I watched the clip and he was really saying ‘ I did these challenges for you you better invite my group’, good thing about being mc though because ig he bumps into a lot of famous people in that building although I’m not sure why she was there because isn’t mmtg under KBS?😭 anyways lowkey showed me how shitty the company is in getting group gigs for the boys because why is a member having to ask for one instead of them reaching out 💀</p>
