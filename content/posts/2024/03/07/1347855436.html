      <p>I’ve seen a lot of kfans clocking on about how weird it is that he’s constantly mentioning them. Usually in survival groups they never talk about old trainees or companies but it’s like he’s counting down the days till Wakeonez debut and promoting himself as still apart of them so fans grow fond / accepting of it. Soft launching if you will.</p>
