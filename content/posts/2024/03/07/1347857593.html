      <p>Gucci event. I don’t think this is the woman from the practice room video but definitely the same one from that Ricky London video and tbh all the boys seemed chill with her. Yeah some mangers are weird but don’t start moving weird just because she’s a woman she seemed to have a good friendship with Ricky in London so I’m guessing she gets along with all of them well.</p>

sorry can't upload pics so this was the only way but the one in the practice room is def her, body shape, hair and sitting position is all the same and yeah she seems chill with all members honestly kzeroses are just jealous/ insecure cause it's a female. They were saying how the way she sat cross legged is seducing them ?????? so you want her to spread her legs then????? 😭😭😭😭 I'm pretty sure she's wakeone staff tho, kzeroses were saying shes korean and in her late 30s or early 40s</p>

      <p>no the staff from london was only a few inches shorter than Ricky while this girl looks below 5'3 if she's wearing taerae/yujins(?) jacket she's not gonna drown in it if she's their height

      <p>Yup its not the London one , for some reason I dont think the London one is a staff that is with them like all the time yes she went abroad with them but i dont think she is in the waiting room or practice room, she kinda has stance of a higherup if that makes sense esp with the way she went dinner with them 

The short girl looks a bit younger than their other managers is why kzeroses so jealous shes not likely to be married , bruh whoever that is theyre getting threats on the same or worse than the ricky manager thing , its tough being a woman🤦‍♀️</p>
