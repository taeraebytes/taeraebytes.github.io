      <p>Poor miskeen maybe Iâ€™ll say thank you this once because I watched the clip and he was really saying â€˜ I did these challenges for you you better invite my groupâ€™, good thing about being mc though because ig he bumps into a lot of famous people in that building although Iâ€™m not sure why she was there because isnâ€™t mmtg under KBS?ðŸ˜­ anyways lowkey showed me how shitty the company is in getting group gigs for the boys because why is a member having to ask for one instead of them reaching out ðŸ’€</p>
