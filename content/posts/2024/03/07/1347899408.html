      <p>Idk if itâ€™s for the cb they havenâ€™t released the date yet. All we know is they are going because hanbin asked jaejae to invite them and they said they would to repay him for doing the challenges with her. But thereâ€™s no actual news on when itâ€™s going to happen.</p>

      <p>I would hope it's for the cb cuz or a little before just cuz for the japan debut it doesn't make sense but it doesn't matter it's good enough

      <p>Usually jaejae does very in-depth research on the idols and their editing is really good so the EP will do well either way, I'm confused by that group though? But I guess they're the variety kings</p>
