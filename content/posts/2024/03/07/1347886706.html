      <p>Idk if it’s for the cb they haven’t released the date yet. All we know is they are going because hanbin asked jaejae to invite them and they said they would to repay him for doing the challenges with her. But there’s no actual news on when it’s going to happen.</p>

      <p>I would hope it's for the cb cuz or a little before just cuz for the japan debut it doesn't make sense but it doesn't matter it's good enough
