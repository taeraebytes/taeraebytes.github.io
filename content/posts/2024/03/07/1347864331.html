      <p>I looked into it though and itâ€™s just speculation with no proof and I think it all stems from the China flight getting cancelled. Apparently some crosins thought he was going to the Gucci event in Shanghai with Ricky which makes no sense because.

1. Hao is currently building a relationship with loewe
2. Why wouldnâ€™t he have just gone to the event in Korea
3. Other crosins themselves were saying they were probably only coming for the entry permit for hk

Heâ€™s had the ost lofficiel and the Loewe event but trust a crosin to make speculation and them all to run with it.</p>
