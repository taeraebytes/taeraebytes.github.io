      <p>Gucci event. I donâ€™t think this is the woman from the practice room video but definitely the same one from that Ricky London video and tbh all the boys seemed chill with her. Yeah some mangers are weird but donâ€™t start moving weird just because sheâ€™s a woman she seemed to have a good friendship with Ricky in London so Iâ€™m guessing she gets along with all of them well.</p>

sorry can't upload pics so this was the only way but the one in the practice room is def her, body shape, hair and sitting position is all the same and yeah she seems chill with all members honestly kzeroses are just jealous/ insecure cause it's a female. They were saying how the way she sat cross legged is seducing them ?????? so you want her to spread her legs then????? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm pretty sure she's wakeone staff tho, kzeroses were saying shes korean and in her late 30s or early 40s</p>

      <p>Diff anon but I agree it is her she's even shorter than matthew in that picture and she's even looking up at him. Matthew is what 5'6? So she's prob 5'3-5'4 ish and the one with Ricky was taken from above so it distorts their height.</p>

yall she short af shes like up to hao's chin (use first pics as ref, second pic she is more forward and closer to cam so she looks taller) so this anon is right she like 5'3 ish shorter than matt for sure and is def the same person in the practice room and the same person who went with hanbin to the gucci event cause they didnt blur her face and she looks exactly like the one in london</p>

      <p>its rumors from crosins because theyve been tryna make it seem like ricky and her are super close and have been tryna get ricky into a dating scandal with her for months now on weibo and when this staff being close to the members thing became an issue 2 days ago they used the opportunity to say the green jacket shes wearing is rickys and she was the same person who went to shanghai with him because the staff was also wearing a green jacket. crosins said it was a secret shanghai date ðŸ˜­

but its two different staff and two different jackets 

gyazo.
com/d5cfcda647d1625e7ca1e7db9b2cd3d5

one is loose and one fits her to a tea so how could it be rickys and the only greenish jacket rickys ever worn and seen wearing is yujins akdjflasdhlf that looks nothing like the one in the practice vid and the staff that went to shanghai with him is yuehua staff that does speak chinese who also went with hao when he went to china. rickys been getting a lashing on weibo from crosins the last couple days with ridiculous rumors because of the yurayura teaser because he got lines and got praises from jnetz while hao got no screentime in the second teaser. lawd help and pray for riyangis and gpds because I saw crosins dragging gunwook too for no reason simply because he got 2 sec screentime in the teaser</p>

      <p>Jesus christtttt people were saying it was yujin or taeraes jacket they're crazy but it's interesting to see how the weibo dickriders brought it to twt immediately I saw the Ricky gf postsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they're upset Ricky has a line and gunwook got 1.6 secs of screentime? Should we just have zb1 become a one man act then likeðŸ˜’ they can go low but if they start with gunwook I will go a lot lower

      <p>from those 'yuehuaz' accounts right? ðŸ˜­ istg theyre so stupid and I think theyre the same person running 10 accs because the way they speak are all the same and the same accounts always interact with one another. Those 'yuehuaz' accounts I'm pretty sure are all rosin akgaes and anti yuehuaz because they always shade the other yuehuaz esp yujin and ricky they dont really gaf bout gyvin because he doesnt threaten hao but yeah they always tweet shady tweets when it comes to yujin and ricky but wording it like they care about them.

idk queefy i saw some crosins on weibo talking about gw about 'that' and how theyre gonna drag all the members and their worst scandal if hao gets no lines and by no lines I mean 90% of the song.</p>
