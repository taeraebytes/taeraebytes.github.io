      <p>Iâ€™ve seen a lot of kfans clocking on about how weird it is that heâ€™s constantly mentioning them. Usually in survival groups they never talk about old trainees or companies but itâ€™s like heâ€™s counting down the days till Wakeonez debut and promoting himself as still apart of them so fans grow fond / accepting of it. Soft launching if you will.</p>
