      <p>im a rosin and atp even i think some rosins are doing too much ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ theyve been doomposting ever since the teaser came out which okay somewhat valid bc even i was scared but even now some of them are STILL complaining eventhough hao got a good portion of the song (deserved) like im a borderline solo stan too but at the end of the day zb1 is a group u cant expect hao to get all of the lines</p>
