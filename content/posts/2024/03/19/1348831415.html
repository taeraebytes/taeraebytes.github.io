      <p>Did you see the promotional ad wakeone is using for the group in japan showing only two members? if it's used to promote the whole group why don't they use a video that shows all of them it's so weird and it's used everywhere ðŸ–•</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s the mv clip of the chorus so itâ€™s hanbin and matthews chorus part although im pretty sure it was just for that 1 ad in shibuya ? Iâ€™ve seen multiple trucks with all their faces on it actually driving round the street promoting the song.</p>
