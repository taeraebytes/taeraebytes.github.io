      <p>Honestly I just hope zb1 have a really good Korean cb and reach more fans cause while we definitely have the strongest fanbase amongst 5th gen we're missing the casual hype that big companies group have (even if it's forced)</p>

      <p>Me too and I prefer a strong fandom they actually put in the work and growing it is the most ideal I think they'll have a good cb

      <p>They needa do something with the jiwoong sitch that's all I'm saying, either make him apologize or give proof that that fan was lying even though I believe her or do some public stunt to make the korean gp sympathize with him and like him again to the point they're willing to look past the scandal. Other option is their song is supperrrr good that even if the korean gp hate him the song is too good to ignore.</p>

      <p>No I'm so deadass the best move is to ignore it there is literally nothing they can say or do at this point that will gain sympathy or have people like him any statement regarding the issue will just reignite hate. They're at a point where jiwoong is just a joke and less of actual hate so better to just keep it pushing tbh any kind of rehash will fuck us over

      <p>i fear they're gonna do that thing that idols who have scandals before their comeback do where they are asked about said scandal at a press conference/comeback showcase and they have to answer to the media to like finally lay things to rest ðŸ˜­ i swear companies do that, most known examples i can think of is aoa or chaewon with garam UGHHHHHHHH i'd hate that let's hope it doesn't happen</p>

      <p>No.... no I don't think that's gonna happen it's too late to have done that and the aoa was considered a national disgrace and bullying is ten fold worse than cursing ðŸ˜­

      <p>It was 3 yrs ago u might find it on pannchoa but he posted this art board and it was just very gruesome pictures of naked women in a collage with other things added to it and he labeled this as "art" and was so proud of it. I think there's a line between fetish and art it was so pretentious and obviously rooted in misogyny mi nuh careeeeee also it was kind of similar to jaeboms pussy wall and it happened around the same time I believe
