      <p>As an Introvert I fucking feel bad for Yujin because he looks so awkward when he dance with with non zb1 member he was like lost and underconfident most of the time just wanted  things to be end quickly lol. I don't know whether this gonna help him in long run as an Idol.</p>

      <p>It's the way the introverts of zb1 are so opposite with each other.
Hao - knows how to socialize 
Ricky - always alone
Yujin - in between but looks so awkward lmao</p>
