      <p>Its why Hao and Yujin is more expensive than hanbin. 
Hanbin is more popular but both Luckyz but fans of Luckyz support them both more than hanbin with those kind of things. Which can definitely help more towards their own respective groups once zb1 disbands.

Because I hate what happened with previous produce groups where the individual is really popular with gp or is the most popular but it's not getting transcended to his or her group or even their solos since their fans aren't willing to shell out money to support them.</p>

      <p>He needs to find a niche something like a male Chungha, if he doesnt take advantage of his feminine dancing experience for his solo and acts all cool like he does now heâ€™s not going anywhere. Also kinda like Woodz he should focus on international popularity over domestic, the best way is to tour a lot around the world</p>

      <p>yea I think he can escape tanking doing this but I don't think he will he will probably continue the flower boy image and take it with him to the grave I feel like he would do bol4 music ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
