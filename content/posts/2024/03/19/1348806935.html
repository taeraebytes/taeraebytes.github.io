      <p>As an Introvert I fucking feel bad for Yujin because he looks so awkward when he dance with with non zb1 member he was like lost and underconfident most of the time just wanted  things to be end quickly lol. I don't know whether this gonna help him in long run as an Idol.</p>

      <p>It's the way the introverts of zb1 are so opposite with each other.
Hao - knows how to socialize 
Ricky - always alone
Yujin - in between but looks so awkward lmao</p>

      <p>I was going to say hao reminds me of myself a little bit I just think he chooses to be reserved I don't think he's that introverted and he said he was like gyuvin when he was younger + new country probably makes him naturally reserved

      <p>Hao is kinda like me. I'm an introvert too. But you can clearly see how his energy depletes everytime he goes on live with the members where he doesn't even talk, that's why bbosong made two tweets about him. 

When he's by himself, you can see him draining in real time too.

There's like tons of different introverts though but hao feels like hes a real introvert. Probably when joining uni too since that's the time so many people where stalking him in the guise of admiring him</p>
