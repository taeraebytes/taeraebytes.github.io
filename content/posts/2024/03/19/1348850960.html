<a href="https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared">https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared</a> Is it bad that I want them to maybe redebut like this? ðŸ¥² All of them mash so well together, not overpowering each others personalities or anything. They also have a great balance and are actually pleasing to look at when walking together. I love smaller groups maybe thatâ€™s why I feel like this ðŸ˜‚</p>
