      <p>Mattbin PC I saw had 999 yen though? Or did it get more expensive? 

Haobin PC was about 3.4k yen last time I saw it.

I bought both PC so I knew both prices</p>

      <p>It's cause it's just an album PC and not a pob. Anyone can still pull them. It's like the hanbin hoodie PC one where everyone wanted it but you can still pull them unlike the pob's where it costs more to get</p>
