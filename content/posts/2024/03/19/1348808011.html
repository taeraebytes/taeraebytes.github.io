      <p>Okay kinda unrelated but Matthews dynamic in the group is interesting cause its quite literally based off of how much is he babied (not a bad thing btw) I feel like he doesnt match well with ppl who dont show him a lot of affection eg Hes so awkward with Ricky and Yujin , all the bbangiz fans gonna hate me but I only feel they are that ‚Äúclose‚Äù because of Korean age formalities</p>
