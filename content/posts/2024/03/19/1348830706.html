      <p>omo... now I'm shyðŸ™ˆ ok idk what ur used to writing but I was on the gyuwook tag and it's bare they're not my otp but I just need a fic to capture their bromance to romance love style. fnndngfmmfm me and oomfs were talking ab them doing rock paper scissor to see who's bottom but I think we need more ppl tapping into gunwook ships they're always teaaaa but I don't even read long fics anything over 10k kills me this can b short if u do end up doing it uhmmm maybe canon compliant ðŸ¤”?
