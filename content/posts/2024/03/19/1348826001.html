      <p>Japanese fans are mad at Wakeone (or whoever their Japanese distributor is) for not having enough stocks of the album. JRosin are also mad that Hao had the same amount of stocks as the other members. I get them since Hao has alot of Rosins traveling just to buy his stuff. Most of his Jfans left empty handed cause of that reason. I really dont know why the stores dont put a limit on how many CDs you can buy. I saw Posts were one fan bought like 10-18 CDs... leave some for other fans too like damn</p>
