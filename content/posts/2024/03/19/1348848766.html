      <p>Expand please cause I don't see it the tip, the size and the shape look natural and his nose is slightly down turned while most nosejobs will make your nose upturned (I have a nose job so no shame I just don't think he did anything)</p>

      <p>oomf and I were just in dms rn discussing it we're not sure what he got done but they found a collage of his side profiles and smth is different like his hooked nose is kind of gone? It's definitely straighter and I'm ngl it's actually good work if it's work but I just don't know where hao would find the time for that??? Idk I'm not a ps master it could be angles and I also haven't paid enough attention to hao to notice

      <p>i've noticed that his nostrils are slightly uneven. i know these are edited but u can see it in his bp profile pic and i don't think they'd intentionally edit them to be that way. not sure if that means it's natural or not but i remember taeyeon had (or has?) that problem and got her nose done</p>

      <p>I think they were always uneven I just shared a cc where someone linked some pics but the mutual I was discussing this with said that it seems like his nostrils are more defined now? I'm not too sure tho

      <p>Idols nose jobs are usually very noticeable so if he did a cosmetic change on his nose I'm betting on a dermal filler, my sister did it and it straighten your nose a little bit without actual surgery</p>
