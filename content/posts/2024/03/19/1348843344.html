      <p>tone deaf dumb low iq weak drag and pathetic I could go on but discussing ps for a member who's been accused of every surgery vs a member who's known to have the least amt procedures + was not even the topic of discussion... mmh u rlly are just an airheaded moron I could have just said Ricky was a plastic surgery monster chin filler fiend but I didn't let's worry about his reinvestment in a Natalie clinic for the next 2 yrs rather than being dumb in my cc ugh I was already getting annoyed today but now I'm just irked good day beloved
