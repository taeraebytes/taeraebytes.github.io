      <p>Its why Hao and Yujin is more expensive than hanbin. 
Hanbin is more popular but both Luckyz but fans of Luckyz support them both more than hanbin with those kind of things. Which can definitely help more towards their own respective groups once zb1 disbands.

Because I hate what happened with previous produce groups where the individual is really popular with gp or is the most popular but it's not getting transcended to his or her group or even their solos since their fans aren't willing to shell out money to support them.</p>
