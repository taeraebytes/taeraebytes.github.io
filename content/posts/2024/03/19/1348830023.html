      <p>Lists of thoughts about zb1 styling sorry for using your page like it's 2016 Tumblr btw:

-I don't want to see Gunwook change hair colors but I'm annoyed by the lack of variety in his hairstyles I think his hair tends to look flatter and less dynamic than other members 
-Basic take but Ricky's make up tends to be too contrasted his skin is super pale, lips and hair super bright, eyes too male, brows too dark..it lacks cohesiveness, he dresses very well though
-Hao is cute but they're pushing the cute image too much when he looks better in sexier and more sensual stylings, his best perfs for me are when he's dressed more mature
-We say this for Hanbin in particular but the aegyo sal is too much for every members lately got us looking like twice</p>

His eyes are so pretty I wish they would stop playing in his face and they neeeed to thicken his brows and tone them a bit
