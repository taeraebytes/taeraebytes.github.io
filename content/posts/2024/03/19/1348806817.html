      <p>Alright I don't wanna say that I feel like he's still largely popular with Koreans it's true he might have a lot of Chinese fans in korea but I don't think they're a majority and it's not like kpop fans care that much and he's not the first or second Chinese idol in history either

      <p>I mean if you see pann comment most of the time korean always mentioned about chinese living in korea buying his merch or doing some display kinda thing. He is popular in korea what I'm trying to say here it's basically chinese living in korea are major part on fandom in korea and same goes for Japan as well.</p>

      <p>I'm sure they're a large chunk of the fandom residing in korea or japan but I don't know if we can say they lead or not I don't think they do it's probably still the natives

      <p>Are you really basing off pann? Where Hao and Wonyoung is always getting the flack? Like whenever there's something about Chinese, you uslaly see comments about Hao and Wonyoung saying that that's why the Chinese should leave the country. 
The funny thing is that it's just them two when there's more Chinese idols than them.

That latest show too where someone shit on the awards show, Koreans on pann where saying it's the Chinese doing it since Chinese people likes shitting on the streets so Koreans will not do that since they're not like Chinese.

Sorry but please don't actually use pann as your source as I freaking hated that site.
