<a href="https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared">https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared</a> Is it bad that I want them to maybe redebut like this? ü•≤ All of them mash so well together, not overpowering each others personalities or anything. They also have a great balance and are actually pleasing to look at when walking together. I love smaller groups maybe that‚Äôs why I feel like this üòÇ</p>

      <p>Everyone rediscovering that the Zerobaseone lineup is actually good when they get content together is so funny but if we're treating this seriously (no one asked) I feel like the 04z are too weak in dance compared to the rest and it'll be too unbalanced, Hao would be perfect if not for rosallins war history but unfortunately too much has happened...I vote for WONBIN</p>

      <p>NFNRNFNNFNFNMFMDMSM DFKMMM wonbin would have a tough time in this group he's too reserved but they might break his shell open but ur right it's so funny how we rmbr this lineup is kind of not bad
