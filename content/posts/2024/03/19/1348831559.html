      <p>Not in a ship way but i really appreciate hanbin for saying he wants to get closer to Ricky and then actively doing it too like Ricky is more on the reserved side so just little things like asking him if he wanted to say hi on his bubble live or randomly meowing back when Ricky meows at him makes me like the duo 🥺</p>

      <p>diff anon but I noticed wookie would always say ricky hyung in bp elims and I felt like he always wanted to get closer and hes been trying esp after that mbti vid where wookie said ricky likes being alone yet he'll still go into his room to spark up conversation and ricky would always get hyped and yap about this and that to him.

nyangteolz rise soon. trust. they just on the down low and hardly get any one on one time so I need gyuv and hanbin to fck off for a bit.</p>

      <p>Oh yall not in this fr he stopped calling Ricky months ago and they were at their best in the summer omg I couldn't believe it Ricky would talk ab gunwook all the time and pick him in a lot of fansign answers for who he finds the cutest... we have to blame this all on gyuvin 😭😭😭😭🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ honestly I believe they're still alive behind the scenes Ricky just never talks ab gunwook but gunwook is keeping up the bargain giving bits and pieces of info it seems like Ricky likes being around him and they're comfortable but Ricky on MUTE... ugh this is why I gave these hoes up 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

      <p>diff anon but in what SENSE 🙄 his reaction is either "wow" or "yeah qubing" or whatever it is 🙄 i get that hes not the best in terms of expressing what he feels in korean but the whole yaoification of shimkongz fiasco seemed onesided even back then, ricky really dgaf about their shipper</p>
