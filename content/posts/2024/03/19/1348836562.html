what planet do rosins live in? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ noone is staying in wakeone except taerae once the contracts up. is it that difficult to think or wrap your head around, other members maybe being more sought after than the center of the group? i have also seen rosins bash hb, mt, gy, yj and gunwook for taking that trip and getting probably more than one vlog for their vacation ðŸ’€ pls grow up</p>
