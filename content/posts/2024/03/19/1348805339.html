      <p>Mattbin PC I saw had 999 yen though? Or did it get more expensive? 

Haobin PC was about 3.4k yen last time I saw it.

I bought both PC so I knew both prices</p>

      <p>Do you know a country where he isnt? /Gen 

Because if there is one, I can buy all his PC's there and just do intl shipping which would be cheaper than buying them on yangdo or Mercari or buy it in my country where I need to buy him with 2-3 other members ðŸ¥²</p>

      <p>uhmmmmmmmm if he's not the most popular he's at least 2-4 so ermmm idk my friend said when she buys on shopee they're cheaper? Idk if that's where Singaporean fans buy their pcs or not but we were comparing prices and she said pobs were a lot cheaper for her than they were for me and we converted the currencies
