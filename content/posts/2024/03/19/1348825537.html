      <p>Its why Hao and Yujin is more expensive than hanbin. 
Hanbin is more popular but both Luckyz but fans of Luckyz support them both more than hanbin with those kind of things. Which can definitely help more towards their own respective groups once zb1 disbands.

Because I hate what happened with previous produce groups where the individual is really popular with gp or is the most popular but it's not getting transcended to his or her group or even their solos since their fans aren't willing to shell out money to support them.</p>

      <p>yeah your one sided beef with Hanbin is getting pathetic bc saying a dancer with his experience and range can't choreograph (he already did in the past) is just crazyyyy mind you you rot in bed all day and answer ccs</p>

      <p>it's honestly quite insane how an opinion gets u so upset loloooollllllllllll there is no one sided beef I just said I don't think he has the range to be a choreographer sure he's tried but to have it as a profession I think ur sorely underestimating what it takes and mmmm nah I'm a full time student plus I work all the time plus my social life I'm usually out everyday thank uuuüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>like it's getting annoying any kind of criticism is suddenly a shot to the heart and he's not even the best idol dancer in the group how would he make choreos outside of his niche and afaik the game in his niche is extremely competitive üò≠
