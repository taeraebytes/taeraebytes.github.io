      <p>Its why Hao and Yujin is more expensive than hanbin. 
Hanbin is more popular but both Luckyz but fans of Luckyz support them both more than hanbin with those kind of things. Which can definitely help more towards their own respective groups once zb1 disbands.

Because I hate what happened with previous produce groups where the individual is really popular with gp or is the most popular but it's not getting transcended to his or her group or even their solos since their fans aren't willing to shell out money to support them.</p>

      <p>yeah your one sided beef with Hanbin is getting pathetic bc saying a dancer with his experience and range can't choreograph (he already did in the past) is just crazyyyy mind you you rot in bed all day and answer ccs</p>

      <p>it's honestly quite insane how an opinion gets u so upset loloooollllllllllll there is no one sided beef I just said I don't think he has the range to be a choreographer sure he's tried but to have it as a profession I think ur sorely underestimating what it takes and mmmm nah I'm a full time student plus I work all the time plus my social life I'm usually out everyday thank uuuüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>omg noooo honestly ppl don't get how bad it is having undiagnosed adhd as an adult I fr thought my life was over last yr ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è idk if u live in a diff country or what ur circumstances are but for me I had to get my insurance card and then I just started looking for psychiatrists near me I looked for one that specializes in women and adhd and then we just did a consultations and a couple appointments. Every psych is different and the one I went to didn't formally test me she said her method is sessions of like "interviews" they were soooo long and she said listening to me and watching me she's come to her own diagnosis and I have ADHD-I she recommended I get formal testing at a facility but she went right into prescribing me medication which I'm thankful for cuz I'm a student and I'd rather this go quicker so school will go smoother. After my semester I'm going to the hospital to get officially tested and get documented tho so if it happens like me definitely seek this out as well. I recommend going directly to a psychiatrist first they all have their own methods but they'll usually diagnose you themselves and provide treatment

      <p>????????? omg wth I'm so sorry u went thru that if they're already adamant on something before you even get the chance to open ur mouth it'll be hard to change their minds. I think it'll just have to be a matter of trial and error + not allowing the doctors to find loopholes in your symptoms researching what you think you might have might help.
