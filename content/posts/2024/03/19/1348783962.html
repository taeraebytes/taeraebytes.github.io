      <p>French content creators are so cool we had a huge french vs Spanish streamers football match it started with a surprise concert with huge french rappers and had like 1mil live viewers, we also had two huge F1 competitions and now they're prepping for a world cup and Neymar and piqué are working w them, all this to say idg why us streamers don't do shit while making much more money like we could have so much fun events like this</p>
