      <p>so i asked my korean moot why his username was such a big deal cuz i too thought it was him showing his love for samsung but now i understand. koreans take huge pride in their home products and samsung is the most well known internationally so they really put their entire pride into samsung even if its not the 'best' (apple vs samsung) but koreans from korea will never admit apple is better because they value pride more and koreans abroad always mock koreans from korea for that. theres this thing where koreans abroad believe they are more open minded therefore smarter as opposed to koreans from korea who still have cavemen mentality unable to move forward an accept things outside of korea so koreans abroad always prefer brands, products that arent korean because they want to distance themselves from koreans from korea because koreans abroad are 'better'. it's been a long existing issue and its why to koreans living in korea dont consider koreans living abroad as 'true' koreans because they always mock koreans in korea yet they want to live the korean gangnam/ seoul lifestyle and get to invade military service.

and the fact that anton grew up abroad, studied abroad and made his username ilovesamsungsomuch when he prob uses an iphone is like slap in every korean from korea face.</p>
