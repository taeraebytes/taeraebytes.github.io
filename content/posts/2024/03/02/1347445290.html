rocks for brains... he can't take a photo of his members without allins victimizing him as "treated like wakeone's staff" now? he walked the photo wall with globalz and did majority of the press interviews and group photos together except for this one snippet interview we don't even know what this was for yet it could just be a short interview in their ze_pisode and he could've been interviewed solo for all we know??💀 they're never grateful for anything smh</p>

      <p>Its cause only globalz were invited. Hanbin wasnt. Wakeone just made the leader go bc they dont trust globalz alone for whatever reason</p>

      <p>That's speculated but it's not unlikely and also who the interviewers choose to interview is up to solely them 🤷‍♀️
