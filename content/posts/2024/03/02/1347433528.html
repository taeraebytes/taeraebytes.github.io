      <p>I am sorry but it kills me the way you take the whole "guardian" thing seriously, the radio didn't invite them, wakeone pushed the members to be there since Jaehwan (who is under WakeOne) was hosting that day, since the start WakeOne was the one who decided which members would go and the whole guardian thing was just a joke, that's why they were laughing.</p>
