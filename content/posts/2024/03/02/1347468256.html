      <p>i feel like ricky has some weird emotional attachment (i know ppl chalk it up to autism or something but i'm not - or i don't think i am? - nd so i'd personally rather not speak on that yk lmao) to his hair like he does with the few black clothing items he owns and wears to death ðŸ˜­ idk why they can't just fix it since kpop stylists do what they wanna all the time.. unless they like it ðŸ¤¨</p>
