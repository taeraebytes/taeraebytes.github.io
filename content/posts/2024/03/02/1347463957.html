      <p>i think it is like their usual music show stages with loud backtrack, you can tell who is actually singing live and who is barely singing live and lip syncs</p>

      <p>I never pay attention but it's probably the usuals singing live and lip syncing but I don't get that it makes things sound wonky either everyone sing live or everyone lip sync ðŸ˜­

      <p>i think Hao Hanbin Taerae are consistent with singing over the backtrack then Matthew and Gunwook do it here and there but the other don't bother ever</p>

      <p>I think this is the consensus? But during award show season almost none of them sang live
