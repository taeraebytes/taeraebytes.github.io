    "question": "Why do u think Sullyoon isnt so popular, i think shes prettiest in 4th gen and most talented visual out of them too, her voice is amazing she dances well.. I dont get it",
    "reply": "It's because nmixx aren't popular sullyoon was getting a lot of recognition at first but that was also at the rise of new jeans and ggs were reaching peaks while nmixx was falling behind. because she is genuinely talented I feel like she wants more of an emphasis on that not her visuals so she's not pushed for them as much as the other groups and their visuals. and her other group members have a chance to shine I feel like they're trying to have the group come into their own not just sullyoon dragging them up and they're growing which I'm happy about hope they hit bigger next cb"
