      <p>I love hanbin and think he has great potential... but whats with this delusion of Allins thinking he’s the next Cha Eunwoo or Kang Daniel... they’re honestly such Koreaboos for seeing any little thing and immediately declaring him relevant, only Jiwoong because of his scandal is relevant, Wonbin is way more relevant in Korea than Hanbin too</p>
