      <p>i did a line distribution real quick (take with a grain of salt i did this with one listen), ad libs and high notes were counted
1. jiwoong ~17 seconds
2.-3. hao/hanbin ~15 seconds
4.-5. matthew/taerae ~13 seconds
6. gunwook ~12 seconds
7.-9. ricky, gyuvin, yujin ~10 seconds</p>

      <p>This rank is close but time wise that isn't right gunwook had 16-17 secs in total (he probably was 5th or 6th in line ranking too) and this doesn't add up to the full song run minute wise but I do think Matthew had the most tho at least when I watched
