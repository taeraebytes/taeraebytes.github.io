      <p>am I the only ones that find looking at fancam views interesting ; hanbin and Hao ofc always at top
 I found that Ricky isn't really as high as his "popularity" he doesn't have a lot of dedication it seems compared to Matthew, jiwoong
 gunwook been increasing strongly since crush he's almost always behind haobin and Matthew , but ig jiwoong fans stepped up for today's performance cause of his issues 
Taerae used to get on par with gunwook and sometimes higher in bloom era, but since he's dwindled to the bottom and gyuvin no longer least viewed</p>

      <p>Funny you say that I was looking at the views earlier ðŸ˜­ but that's true can we clock how gunwook is consistently 4th or 5th like bishhhhhh but yea jiwoong fans stepped it up today I was surprised he was slowly going down
