      <p>The cover was cute I didn't watch the other groups they were probably better but this wasn't bad everyone needs to chill. Anons line distribution is way off and it's honestly subjective past that it depends on who u like for me at least I enjoyed it gunwook did well and had decent lines and ngl for once jiwoongs voice didn't annoy me
