      <p>I was going to say maybe hanbin but I remember kallins saying that aside from the high note the rest was just adlibs so I wonder who actually got lines this time then if not their usual vocalist</p>

      <p>why do i feel like this is one of those cases where all subfandoms are being overdramatic and self-victimising and then when we watch the performance it'll be a different story bc if none of the top 4 vocal members are singing then.... üò≠ like idk it just doesn't make sense to me, there's 9 members in the group, if a few of them take over everything then other member fans would be mad so now the vocal member fans are mad bc they're not singing as much as they want them to. or something like that idk</p>
