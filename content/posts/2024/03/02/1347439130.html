      <p>You guys look stupid trying to argue about who is worse, it just depends on who you stan. Of course that gpds will find Allins worse bc they keep terrorizing Gunwook, but if you ask Riyangis they will say Rosins. And if you ask seokryudans they will say that it's the two of them. Allins don't come for Ricky as much as they come for Gunwook or Hao and nowadays Taerae too, while Rosins don't come for Gunwook as much as they come for Ricky, Hanbin and lately Yujin. Meanwhile Matthew takes the worst part of both fandoms and no one cares about Jiwoong and Gyuvin.</p>

      <p>On this platform the only people that have ever argued with me are allins and because of anonymity I can't tell who's who but for the most part this kind of beef never happens üò≠
