rocks for brains... he can't take a photo of his members without allins victimizing him as "treated like wakeone's staff" now? he walked the photo wall with globalz and did majority of the press interviews and group photos together except for this one snippet interview we don't even know what this was for yet it could just be a short interview in their ze_pisode and he could've been interviewed solo for all we know??💀 they're never grateful for anything smh</p>

      <p>Maybe they didn't wanna interview him like what can u do ab that aren't they the ones that said hanbins so desired and sought after so it makes sense he gets what he gets whys it different now?

      <p>Its cause only globalz were invited. Hanbin wasnt. Wakeone just made the leader go bc they dont trust globalz alone for whatever reason</p>

      <p>That's speculated but it's not unlikely and also who the interviewers choose to interview is up to solely them 🤷‍♀️

      <p>This is a movie premiere, they have to give 4 tickets if 4 members are attending and the premiere was probably made by CJ anyways so yeah this take is dumb lmao</p>

      <p>Tickets, invitations whatever you want to call it. And they are promoting the film in Korea bc the movie was released a long time ago internationally, the one with the most Korean recognition is Hanbin, so trust me he's not the one who wasn't invited.</p>

      <p>1 this is speculation calm down 2 it's speculated because there was a focus on the three members and 3 if an instance where the 3+1 sitch already occurred under those circumstances it's not a wild speculation

      <p>is the solo interview in the room with us rn? And y'all would delete y'all's tweets about wakeone hating him and claiming it's cause he's the most relevant... 😭😭 Like you schizos can't keep a narrative to save your lives arguing with y'all is a waste of time fr at least rosins hit you with the facts y'all just yap to yap and end up contradicting yourselves girl bye</p>

      <p>Saying that rosins is hitting people with facts when they were tweaking about that haohao time with hanbin video bc it lasted 12 minutes and they took some polaroids just for Zhanghao to do the same shit with Matthew next week 😭
