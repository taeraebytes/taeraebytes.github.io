      <p>Tbh this performance proved to me that zb1 needs a cb song that highlights their vocals more than rap, dance or concept,,, in bloom was too conceptual  (find that was planned before lineup) and crush was too dance and performance focused ,, I know u want gunwook rap but Wakeone are just gonna play around and give him a short speaking line like usual I want to hear him sing</p>

      <p>Either way gunwook isn't going to get much I'd rather a less vocally challenging song like we can go the enhypen route and just lip sync till we drop dance and rap songs are more interesting anyways
