      <p>i think it is like their usual music show stages with loud backtrack, you can tell who is actually singing live and who is barely singing live and lip syncs</p>

      <p>I never pay attention but it's probably the usuals singing live and lip syncing but I don't get that it makes things sound wonky either everyone sing live or everyone lip sync ðŸ˜­

      <p>i think Hao Hanbin Taerae are consistent with singing over the backtrack then Matthew and Gunwook do it here and there but the other don't bother ever</p>

      <p>I agree with anon, he gets way more than he deserves considering his skill level and i dont get why people clock him for being ugly and corny but not for this.</p>

      <p>He's a favorite so u can't be too surprised I definitely think it's better than jiwoong plus his intl popularity can back him up but skill wise I agree. Personally I find him cute and charming so I just feel bad

      <p>Ricky suits rnb songs without dancing. Idol songs just aren't for him and moreover he doesn't even try to improve his stamina for stages</p>
