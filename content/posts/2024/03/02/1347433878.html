rocks for brains... he can't take a photo of his members without allins victimizing him as "treated like wakeone's staff" now? he walked the photo wall with globalz and did majority of the press interviews and group photos together except for this one snippet interview we don't even know what this was for yet it could just be a short interview in their ze_pisode and he could've been interviewed solo for all we know??💀 they're never grateful for anything smh</p>

      <p>Its cause only globalz were invited. Hanbin wasnt. Wakeone just made the leader go bc they dont trust globalz alone for whatever reason</p>

      <p>That's speculated but it's not unlikely and also who the interviewers choose to interview is up to solely them 🤷‍♀️

      <p>This is a movie premiere, they have to give 4 tickets if 4 members are attending and the premiere was probably made by CJ anyways so yeah this take is dumb lmao</p>

      <p>Tickets, invitations whatever you want to call it. And they are promoting the film in Korea bc the movie was released a long time ago internationally, the one with the most Korean recognition is Hanbin, so trust me he's not the one who wasn't invited.</p>

      <p>1 this is speculation calm down 2 it's speculated because there was a focus on the three members and 3 if an instance where the 3+1 sitch already occurred under those circumstances it's not a wild speculation
