      <p>I mean, even if it is out of range for everyone, you know who can sing or not based on it.

The f4 minus hanbin is of course one
Ricky messed up
Taerae struggling
Hanbin out of breathe and struggling 
Gunwook struggling but ok for me 
Matthew so nasal 
Hao is not too bad but a little struggling but he's not showing it too much unlike the others</p>

      <p>It's probably just their tone itself here. Taerae's voice is different from Hao itself but it's clear for me taerae was struggling more than hao and it's all because it way out of his range more than hao was. But it's clear that it's just a song that did not think abt their range ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>The song was yea way more into haos range than taeraes but it might be the tone he was rlly getting all up in the mic and waving his hands it's so funny how anyone expects them to sing live dancing if this was them standing ðŸ˜­ yea we don't need another in bloom
