      <p>K-pop predictions accs say that Hybe will snatch some members from zb1. Yujin and Gunwook make sense. If Hybe reaches out to them, they’ll 100% sign. Also many gpds want Gunwook in hybe, they don’t even consider other companies😭</p>

      <p>hybe is literally not a better option wow their propaganda worked... they literally suck they change all their idols appearances and the ps is never a hit. They continuously put out mid the only thing they excel at are shoots and even then it's copy and pasted for every single one of their groups... no originality whatsoever and everything they produce is so uninspired at this point. I'm a creative and it would actually kill me inside to put gunwook in a company so creatively stunted and that's KNOWN for talent regression... kill me bruh I'd actually rather die. It's not like there are companies that actually work their hardest for their idols there's those once in a blue moon companies that do okay but idk I don't have anything in mind I just want him to be successful and treated well🙆‍♀️ also hybe is a demonic institution they will ask gunwook for his soul in exchange for his debut no thanks
