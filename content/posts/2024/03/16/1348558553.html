      <p>He's had a solo sched (that driving thingy from jtbc) and baby cloud from crush era.
Rk didn't get anything except that thing where they sang Spanish with gunwook and Matthew. 

The next rk schedule is this month after that.

Gunwook also only had that Spanish thingy until mca special mc.

Gyuvin does not have the under treatment y'all want him to have. It's just that he's not making news on any schedule he has unless he creates controversy out of it</p>
