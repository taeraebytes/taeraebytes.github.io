      <p>I mean, even if it is out of range for everyone, you know who can sing or not based on it.

The f4 minus hanbin is of course one
Ricky messed up
Taerae struggling
Hanbin out of breathe and struggling 
Gunwook struggling but ok for me 
Matthew so nasal 
Hao is not too bad but a little struggling but he's not showing it too much unlike the others</p>
