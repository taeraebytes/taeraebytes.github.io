      <p>wakeone kind of set zb1 up by introducing them with a super parasocially bf concept, cuz hao is fruity as hell no one's believing that, jiwoong sibal, taerae turned out to be fruitier than we thought and he had a massive glow down, knets think matthews ugly and they also think gyuvins an incel</p>

      <p>have u stanned a kpop group before? This is the norm you gotta get parasocial for a check and tbh those poor company ppl who get paid $10/hr are probably tweaking because who would've predicted all that but they'll be fine they got their audiences well sorta kinda

      <p>Also Matthew isn't famous for people to care that he's ugly his fans are still parasocial and most c and k rosins are gf stans they don't care that he's gay I do think they're pushing with the cringe tiktoks and the old school famservice sometimes (ex fancon)it's too has been no one wants that</p>

      <p>Matthew isn't famous in Korea and he never was to begin with he's gaining fans slowly but he's always had his intl audience and it works I don't even think the company counted on him gaining a big kfandom anyways. Yea those girls do not care and I respect it like why do ppl care how they stan 😭😭😭😭 if I wanna gf stan on a gay boy I will do just that they can be cringe but that's just what gf stans do🤷‍♀️
