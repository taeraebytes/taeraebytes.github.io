      <p>For me it's too late attitude wise cause he doesn't seem to be improving in that aspect outside of the cursing thing he's been shady ont too many times imo but if he drastically improve in skills I could respect him</p>

      <p>if he improves his skills (he won't) I'll be just like "thanks for not messing up" but that's it rlly like there's nothing he gives that I want and that's fine continue being a stay at home husband
