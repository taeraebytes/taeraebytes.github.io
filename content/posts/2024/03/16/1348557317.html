      <p>ricky and gunwook are the real miskeen members of the group idk why they aren't allowed to attend any schedules without another member monitoring them.. ricky's is clearly due to the assumption that his korean isn't good enough for him to speak on his own but gunwook? if their reasoning is that sometimes he runs his mouth off a bit then it doesn't make sense that theyve had gyuvin attend solo schedules</p>

      <p>CLOCK THAT TEAAAAAA Ricky I feel like needs a schedule that's tailored to smth he can do good in like I don't think he's versatile enough to just be thrown into a random schedule ykwim? and gunwook ok I feel like he's learning to have that very witty variety personality and he's a natural at it I personally never found him his mouth runny it's only ever certain groups of ppl that do but eh he's growing he'll be aight they both would do just fine like everyone else at a solo schedule and it's rlly annoying that they don't get it ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
