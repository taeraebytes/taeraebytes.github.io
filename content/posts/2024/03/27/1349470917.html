      <p>Isn't his contract expiring in September? We have 5 months to manifest gunwook mubank. They're really the best to be MC with since they sometimes perform on kbs award shows and can also win the best couple on the entertainment awards, which would mean gp will also know them.

Like Eunchae was not the most popular member before she got MC. After she got it, she's now one of the most liked.</p>
