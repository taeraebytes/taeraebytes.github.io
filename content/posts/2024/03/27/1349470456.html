      <p>I was looking at Japan Kcon details because I was hoping to go and they have this new segment called m countdown stage ? Iâ€™m still not sure what it is. But Iâ€™m certain hanbin will be an MC now, I was thinking maybe jaehyun too since bnd are going but they usually do 1 Korean MC and then 1 MC from the country of the show so maybe a kep1er member since they are going on the same day ?</p>

      <p>but Krazy doesn't have ties with mnet. Plus hanbin already got an mc segment during last KCON they are probably going to give him another segment</p>

      <p>Hmm idk last year it made sense they didnâ€™t have the mca mc there because neither of their groups attended any of the kcons afaik. But in all honesty if bnd riize and zb1 attend kcons it would make sense for them to use their own mnet associated mc then ask someone else and while all three are still rookies they will most likely go to a couple of them.</p>

      <p>That's not true gidle attended kcon LA next year and miyeon wasn't mc. I don't think mcs should mc at every kcon just because there's mcs because they're obviously better options depending on the country but it's just who mnet chooses and they're obviously obsessed with hanbin as he's been mc in kcon France and the upcoming kcon HK so</p>

      <p>They should just let rk mc for kcon la
For kcon Japan, hmm. Probably better if there's no mushow mc there so it's a new mc and people won't get tired of them.

If I always watch the same people doing mc and I don't like how they mc, I'll probably be so bored already lol</p>
