      <p>I was looking at Japan Kcon details because I was hoping to go and they have this new segment called m countdown stage ? Iâ€™m still not sure what it is. But Iâ€™m certain hanbin will be an MC now, I was thinking maybe jaehyun too since bnd are going but they usually do 1 Korean MC and then 1 MC from the country of the show so maybe a kep1er member since they are going on the same day ?</p>
