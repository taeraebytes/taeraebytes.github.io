      <p>ok kinda random but that new cube bg popped on my tiktok fyp and one of those dudes gave the exact same vibes as hanbin like it's crazy, so i typed the name of the group on twt so i could know which member it was and while doing that i learned that hanbin said that he will cry during this mcountdown show bc his cube friend is finally debuting... then i learned that the members with the same vibes it's called hyeonbin, if he reveals that this member is his friend then something is up and one of them stole the whole vibe and personality of the other one bc the vibes are the same</p>
