 rosins in the qrts of that post look mad stupid now because the new guidelines are nearly identical to the ones posted last year including the sending an email first and the first come first serve and the type of support that is permitted</p>

      <p>Yeah if you look in the qrts so many of the quotes are saying they are doing it to target zhbar. Iâ€™m 90% sure a lot of them didnâ€™t even open the document because they are all talking about wakeone banning ads for hao and his support cafe when that was literally mentioned no where in the document the outlines clearly state this is about fan gifts being sent to the boys.</p>

 this is why some of the big accounts need to actually comprehend what they are reading cuz posting shit like this when absolutely nothing has changed in terms of rules is crazy know your whole sf gets easily riled up. Like the only thing that has actually changed is gifts are only allowed on anniversary and birthdays and the fansigns can only have letters which impacts the boys equally .</p>

      <p>True but then again that could be down to the fact their c bar shares a lot too like I remember a couple days ago them saying they only approved haoâ€™s solo ad because they wanted hanbin to have one too just for hanbinâ€™s c bar to come out and clarify that they got rejected for the solo ad by Lapone on the 8th ( the same day as haoâ€™s cbar) but they hadnâ€™t publicly posted about it. Itâ€™s important to remember that with anything from this company or fanbases you only know what is shows to you or told nothing about whatâ€™s going on behinds the scenes.</p>
