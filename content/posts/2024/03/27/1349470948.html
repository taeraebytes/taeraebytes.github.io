      <p>iâ€™m not sure when this schedule was announced but i was ???? at it since groups only really go on these during comebacks but then i kinda thought maybe they did it as a treat for the korean fans since theyâ€™ve been pissed at the fancon (even before it happened) and japanese activities in general, just something to hold them over ðŸ˜­ very low effort schedule</p>

      <p>It did seem like that because when you think of it they have come back from Japan and the only schedule they would have had this week before flying out to Kcon hk is hanbin at mca. The other one is something else related to Japan debut ( the pj live tomorrow) so I guess this was a way of pacifying kfans for another week.</p>

      <p>I like that they are promoting them well in Japan but they also need to bring this energy for the k fancon and comeback period too because we canâ€™t have the kside dropping them because of w1 poor promotion. Plus w1 are already know for prioritising their j market which I mean if they were a permanent group wouldnâ€™t be such a bad thing because they would have time to build both but unfortunately they donâ€™t have the time.</p>
