      <p>the only gyuvin pairing that had atleast a tiny bit of yaoi appeal was shimkongz but he himself ruined it lol. 2binz yaoi is borderline incest only freaks ships them. creeps who ship him with yujin or hao should be in jail</p>

      <p>well yh cause thats a pair of friends who have never done weird things, even ricky has done some things that can be perceived as yaoi appeal , unless u wanna go down the two straight guys homoerotic appeal that just takes too much energy for me</p>

      <p>not related but do u think 2binz would stay close after zb1 saw someone said in other cc that gyuvin is the type to drop his friends easily like he used to talk abt tempest and hui a lot bfr now he barely mentioned them while hanbin is still close to matthew and other cube friends ðŸ¤”</p>
