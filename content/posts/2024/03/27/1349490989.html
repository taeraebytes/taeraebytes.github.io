    "reply": "Oh you're right hmmm idk you can tell he takes every compliment seriously like it's the first one hes ever gotten it's cute hes probably so happy about it. I rmbr there was this photo of him and lip j I saw at the beginning of bp when he was still chubby and I thought he was soooooooo cuteeeeeee I hope he got some back then but he seems like the type to just appreciate the change. Me personally I'm turning into a villain"
