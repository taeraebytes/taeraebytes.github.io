      <p>Lowkey that's been a rule in kpop me and my friend were planning a gift for gunwook (exams ruined itü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and she was checking if she had to email wakeone first or not cuz it's just common with other agencies so it might turn out to be shit but they're not the first to do it

      <p>Idk why fans are even suprised about this tbh the boys are popular they probably have a shit Ron of gifts being sent to the agency everyday and they don‚Äôt just go straight to the boys staff have to sort them for security reasons and then they stay at the agency till the members can pick it up. So many groups don‚Äôt accept fan gifts at all I think it‚Äôs lucky that we are still allowed to send things. Also cmiiw but it‚Äôs always been the rule that you needed approval first but people were sending without it anyway I‚Äôm guessing they are cracking down on that.</p>

      <p>I read the policy so originally no you didn't have to email for approval before sending but it's common with other agencies so it's not biggie and yea they get sent a lottttttttt like it might get to a point where the influx they're unable to handle all the gifts so it makes sense. I'm just sad cuz gpds gifted gunwook the best stuff and he always wore them ugh....
