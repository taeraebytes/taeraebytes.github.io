      <p>Icl tho in terms of MC benefits tho they really be taking that crown because no other music show is promoting their MCs like this. So all three hit big bagging this gig.</p>

      <p>Isn't his contract expiring in September? We have 5 months to manifest gunwook mubank. They're really the best to be MC with since they sometimes perform on kbs award shows and can also win the best couple on the entertainment awards, which would mean gp will also know them.

Like Eunchae was not the most popular member before she got MC. After she got it, she's now one of the most liked.</p>

      <p>I’m hoping but hybe lowkey seems to have dibs on that mubank spot 😭 also idk how likely it is that they will have MCs from the same group on 2 different shows, I know they have bnd so maybe there is hope but I’m not sure on the likelihood of mnet letting someone in one of their groups mc for a kbs show.</p>
