      <p>Instead of having our biased opinion about dancing when most of us are not dancers, let's have a serious discussion, like a serious question from me, the anon who said hanbin's nose doesn't move when he smiles, but mine also doesn't move, do all of your noses really move? Genuinely, i am really curious
Also i have noticed he scrunches his nose often, i also do the same and i have sinus problem except that my nose really doesn't move</p>
