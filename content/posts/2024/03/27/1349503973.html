      <p>I have definitely ran a mile I went to a British school and physical education was mandatory in school twice a week till 16 and idk about other schools but at least mine we had this thing called cross country we had to do once in winter and once in summer ( we had to run 2 miles) and they would do fitness test on us every term where we had to do the multi-stage fitness test ( pacer test/ bleep test it’s got loads of names). But like that was part of school and I’m 22 now doing cardiology at uni and I’d be so pissed if they randomly made me run a mile to graduate when that has nothing to do with my degree or abilities in cardiology 😂</p>
