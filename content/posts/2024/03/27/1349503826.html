      <p>iâ€™m not sure when this schedule was announced but i was ???? at it since groups only really go on these during comebacks but then i kinda thought maybe they did it as a treat for the korean fans since theyâ€™ve been pissed at the fancon (even before it happened) and japanese activities in general, just something to hold them over ðŸ˜­ very low effort schedule</p>

      <p>It did seem like that because when you think of it they have come back from Japan and the only schedule they would have had this week before flying out to Kcon hk is hanbin at mca. The other one is something else related to Japan debut ( the pj live tomorrow) so I guess this was a way of pacifying kfans for another week.</p>

      <p>I like that they are promoting them well in Japan but they also need to bring this energy for the k fancon and comeback period too because we canâ€™t have the kside dropping them because of w1 poor promotion. Plus w1 are already know for prioritising their j market which I mean if they were a permanent group wouldnâ€™t be such a bad thing because they would have time to build both but unfortunately they donâ€™t have the time.</p>

      <p>gyuvin said something on bubble live that implied that the members shared ideas and the staff used them for the fancon? so i think they'll keep doing that, especially bc they've seen the response from korean fans (which is probably why the japanese one was better in the first place since the first fancon response was so bad) like they'll keep the energy up for the second korean fancon</p>

      <p>I think so too I don't think they're purposely promoting better in japan it's like they're just getting better with time so whatever comes later will get the better

      <p>the boys do not get paid enough for this typa stuff if they really ask them what they should do for a fancon ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª its the job of their staff to know what fans want or search for it. not the boys. who knows what typa stuff the boys saw while trying to know what the fans want. worst company for real</p>

      <p>I think their ideas came from their head like staff can do their research but when you interact with ur fans enough on bubble for example you'll know better than the staff in some cases and I feel like member input is a great thing like it makes the craft more personal

      <p>Anon thatâ€™s not how that works a lot of groups will sit with their teams and give inputs on things they do or donâ€™t want. Itâ€™s not saying the company will 100% do them all but there have been loads of cases where you can see groups giving their input and itâ€™s good to know wakeone listened to some of the things the boys wanted instead of doing what they did for kr fancon and doing what they thought fans wanted.</p>

      <p>And I feel like at least to some extent idols should have a say in what kind of art they're making like not every idol but a lot of idols are creatives . So I feel like it just makes things more authentic and i just like to see what ppl come w like gyuvins vlog for example that was better than anything the company has released because it came from him and the fans obviously like what their idols make more than what staff make
