 rosins in the qrts of that post look mad stupid now because the new guidelines are nearly identical to the ones posted last year including the sending an email first and the first come first serve and the type of support that is permitted</p>

      <p>Yeah if you look in the qrts so many of the quotes are saying they are doing it to target zhbar. Iâ€™m 90% sure a lot of them didnâ€™t even open the document because they are all talking about wakeone banning ads for hao and his support cafe when that was literally mentioned no where in the document the outlines clearly state this is about fan gifts being sent to the boys.</p>

 this is why some of the big accounts need to actually comprehend what they are reading cuz posting shit like this when absolutely nothing has changed in terms of rules is crazy know your whole sf gets easily riled up. Like the only thing that has actually changed is gifts are only allowed on anniversary and birthdays and the fansigns can only have letters which impacts the boys equally .</p>
