      <p>Ive been wondering about that cause Gyuvin doesn't seem even a little uncomfortable with Hao for example but dropped his friends for alcohol, I think rather than super strict and cruel he might have grown up super sheltered and out of touch</p>

      <p>People be doing too much with the whole homophobic thing, like you can see that he's comfortable with Hanbin and Hao if he was super homophobic he wouldn't be fine with them and wouldn't be all up on their faces</p>
