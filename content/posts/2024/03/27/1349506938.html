      <p>Lowkey that's been a rule in kpop me and my friend were planning a gift for gunwook (exams ruined itü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and she was checking if she had to email wakeone first or not cuz it's just common with other agencies so it might turn out to be shit but they're not the first to do it

      <p>yes limiting gifts is common but why are they stopping fan projects too and they dont even want the same fan projects for different members they want it first come first serve and it will cause chaos bc there will surely be favoritism allegations again</p>
