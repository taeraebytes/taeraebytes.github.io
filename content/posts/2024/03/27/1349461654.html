      <p>there have been some jjanggyuz tweets blowing up lately by those ppl who ship anyone with a dick together bc hao has mimed kissing him like twice in recent performances/dance practices and gyuvin keeps acting all close at the end of some of the performances at the fancon ðŸ˜­ as a classy monogamist shipper i stand with u like it's not the yaoi, it's not hitting like that</p>
