      <p>iâ€™m not sure when this schedule was announced but i was ???? at it since groups only really go on these during comebacks but then i kinda thought maybe they did it as a treat for the korean fans since theyâ€™ve been pissed at the fancon (even before it happened) and japanese activities in general, just something to hold them over ðŸ˜­ very low effort schedule</p>
