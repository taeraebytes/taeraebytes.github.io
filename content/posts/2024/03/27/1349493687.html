As for ricky scolding dungg, it happened a long time ago, when they first debuted, the person who exposed her didn't say why she was scolded, but I guess it was bad because Ricky doesn't seem like someone who would open his mouth for no reason.",

While he was shopping and he told them straight to leave him alone idk if it's the same incident but yea. He also doesn't acknowledge them at airports but oversense was just being pushy and weird there were weird tweets she made ab underage Ricky but she's obviously just a sick in the head girl idk if she's followed him around tho"

      <p>she is ricky sasaeng, her name is sosweetricky, she was scolded by ricky for something and maybe the other sasaengs also heard it because later they exposed her, she rebanded to sosweetshimkongz and followed them to london and asked the members to pay for her food, then got exposed again after London, then rebranded again and got exposed again after the Japan vacation</p>
