      <p>there actually is substance though which is why taegunv (their normal chemi, not a ship) is also really popular in south korea. kfans like how they're mutually supportive of each other and compliment each other but I think the reason why it blew up as a ship is because taerae refuses to engage in yaoi fanservice whereas gunwook tried it a few times with him (which is ironic if anything you'd think taerae not engaging with it at all would tank the ship but it made it blow up)</p>
