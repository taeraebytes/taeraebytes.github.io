      <p>they literally have critically laid out points as to why a certain vocalist is above the other etc AND they have hundreds of people who vocally train in their comments to dispute them if they're wrong (there's none to dispute cuz they're right) so if You (the anon not u requifiem) can give us any actual reason why any of the things said in the analyses are wrong then go ahead</p>

      <p>this is so funny it's like saying you have to be a maths expert to understand why 2 is greater than 1 like you don't have to be a vocal expert to recognize jay is MILES better than hanbin at singing like they're just incomparable help</p>

      <p>i think in this case mostly vocal experts or vocally involved people would recognize the technique abilities meanwhile everyone else would rate jay as much higher. ik theres always the tone v technique arguments in vocal discussions im not sure which matters more cuz in this case jays tone rlly does outweigh to the point hes painted as the better singer
