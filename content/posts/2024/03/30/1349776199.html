    "question": "Fashion anon here - itâ€™s really dependent obviously this is still the early stages and cmiiiw but was Yujin wearing givenchy too ? It 100% could be an endorsement but I wouldnâ€™t go as far to say as such yet more obvious sponsorships are like hao with Loewe or woongsungz with Gucci because itâ€™s been an accumulation of things. Itâ€™s entirely possible that they just wanted the exposed because they are flying to Kcon hk and hao is an extremely popular idol there so the exposure is good. If heâ€™s consistently being dressed in new clothes though then itâ€™s really possible. I think you should definitely pay attention to what heâ€™s wearing tomorrow from what I remember Gucci dressed hanbin for mca in Paris and AAA, wakeone might have them go for matching fits that are unsponsored but itâ€™s possible they might wear sponsored suits too in which case Iâ€™d expect hanbin to wear Gucci and hao either something from Loewe maybe Gucci and if givenchy is really wanting to sponsor him then maybe them. Thatâ€™s a big IF they are wearing sponsored suits.",
