      <p>am i the only one who finds super weird rosins and zeroses blowing up stuff about hao's academics like that's an aspect of him that he barely shares with us (i remember during kcon japan live gyuvin or hanbin said congrats for passing an exam or whatever and hao didn't say much like he doesn't talk about it) so why do his fans feel entitled to repost all that while simultaneously disagreeing with sassaengs or invasive shippers like they're the same</p>
