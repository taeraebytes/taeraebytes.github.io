      <p>jay's emotions while singing kinda distracts you from the fact that his technique doesn't sound too good like from an untrained ear i can tell he strains a lot and not to mention he's probably unstable while dancing or moving that's something i will always give to hanbin he found a comfortable way to manipulate his voice and he's very very stable live</p>
