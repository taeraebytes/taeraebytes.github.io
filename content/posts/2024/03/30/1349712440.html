      <p>they ruined her with the veneers and nose. the reason why heeseung was able to survive to those things was bc he was the star of the show and engenes liked the lineup but with yunah she was not the most popular one and then you have runext fans being obsessed with the whole "fitting the concept" thingy.</p>
