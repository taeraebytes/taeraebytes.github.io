      <p>This whole members can post on any platform they want doesnt make sense and is just stupid, it's wk1 who decides mainly. They are strategic about who to post where. All of the Loewe related posts about hao were posted on weibo where their account is monetized and he has crazy engagement there, lol even c-rosins clocked they're doing this on purpose so they stopped giving them so much clout</p>
