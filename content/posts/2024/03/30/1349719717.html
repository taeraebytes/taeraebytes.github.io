i went through this acc for fun and wondered how did he debut? 😭 was f4 that big back then like srsl how the fuck? 
im also a newer fan, like literally stanning them after jw’s scandal, i just rlly dgaf about him tbh but his skill honestly bothered me so much, he overdances but somehow his arm movements are very weak, no torso control whatsoever. his vocal is meh, zb1’s rapping skill is kinda a joke in general apart from gw (and maybe mt but that’s kinda a reach since he didnt have that much rap lines lol). wtf is his position in this group lmao? at least for gv ppl can say he has a big heart or wtv the fuck, but jw barely interacts with his members aside from fsv and queerbait and his visual is tbh hit or miss. dude can be in a hiatus and wont be missed</p>

      <p>DAMN SIS howd u come across my cc this quick this was like 2 months ago😭 uhhhh yea his dancing is very stagnant his tone kills me and he doesnt interact w the group well and its obvious he lives on his own. I just fw the fact that hes consistent like he doesnt careeeee but yea f4 was HUGE during bp and jiwoog was consistenly top 5 for each episode and he never dropped out the top9. His visuals took him far plus the fake alliance cuz his core fandom kind of wasnt there it was yujin and hanbin fans that carried its why he got 8
