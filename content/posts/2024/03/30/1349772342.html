      <p>im gonna get my riyangi card revoked over stating this but riyangis esp intl side needs to stop delude themselves into thinking that w1 putting ban on his bbl/sns or something 😒😒like okay it made sense when the bbl live incident happened but its been five (FIVE!!!) months, even before they launched bbl ricky is pretty unactive too compared to another member. he caught the blackpink disease me think (releasing few uploads at short time and went into hibernation for a century)</p>

      <p>they're genuinely deluding themselves like I'm sorry that boy is not being restricted this happened in October 😭 and I think it's valid to be upset like what's the point of paying $4 a month for sparse messages like I get the point of him sending authentic messages but a heyyy how are u here and then will do🤦‍♀️

      <p>Anon we think the same. I felt a lot better once I stopped comparing him to other members and just actually acknowledged that he’s never been one to post on socials a lot like even back when he had insta and stuff I remember people saying he never posted a lot. I’d be more concerned if there was a sudden change in his posting pattern but it’s remained pretty consistent since debut and it’s like that for all the members they have all remained consistent in their posting patterns. The only one I thought was an actual ban was the bubble live one.</p>

      <p>so from the way u thought, he really hates his fans then? or has no intention to communicate with the fans? usually we have to wait 1-2 weeks for his update, the most long about 20 days but now it become 2-3 months. yeah he's not banned lol</p>
