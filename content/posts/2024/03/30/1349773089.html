      <p>they literally have critically laid out points as to why a certain vocalist is above the other etc AND they have hundreds of people who vocally train in their comments to dispute them if they're wrong (there's none to dispute cuz they're right) so if You (the anon not u requifiem) can give us any actual reason why any of the things said in the analyses are wrong then go ahead</p>

      <p>Yeah i like that person (and sootzubae who is the female idol analyst equivalent) bc they MOSTLY disregard the subjective stuff (tone, musical interpretation, genre, etc.) for their ranking, which is essentially based off vocal support, i.e. the foundation of all vocalization. It just makes sense that the most 'objective' ranking would be based off something actually measurable, though even then their is subjectivity and dispute concerning the tier criteria, absence of diverse live materials, etc.

I don't see the point of looking to vocal support as the sole parameter for what constitutes a good pop singer bc what matters most in pop is the ability to move and connect with an audience, which you can do without healthy technique. Plus some of those vocal analysts really just make analysis their whole personality and don't seem to value musicality at all imo. But I do get annoyed at those who downplay its importance completely bc 9/10 times it's bc they learned their highly praised amazing fave is underdeveloped lol (probably 75% of idols across gens). Best believe if they learned their bias were proficient, they'd be preaching the significance of this imperfect system.</p>

      <p>i agree w that because when comparing those two you kind of see what the average person criteria for a good pop singer is the overwhelming majority would choose jay me personally ik gunwook is underdeveloped but his potential yeassss lock him in a room with a vocal teacher we could go to great vocal places
