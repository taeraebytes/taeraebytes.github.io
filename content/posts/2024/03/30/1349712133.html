      <p>well another anon here and i looked at the old school new school video and matthew is not hitting every part of the choreo in the second and third dance for old school, pls do me a favor and watch that video and then talk. the member that was the best overall is gunwook, after gunwook is hanbin then yujin (not alot of difference to hb, the dance just looks a lil easier than the old school one) and matthew is automatically last cause he missed multiple steps in TWO dances</p>

      <p>Her cc hasn’t been active for days and the thread was posted after the tweet started blowing up. That person is annoying but I really don’t think it was about your cc this time because it probably would have been posted yesterday if so.</p>

      <p>Not related to this person at all but that tweet about whacking has shown me kpop fans really can’t differentiate styles because why are most the qrts them saying their fave and half of them can’t provide a video of their fave actually doing whacking and the other half are video of idols doing tutting 😭 like I’ll give it to hanbin i think he’s the only active idol right now that could actually do the challenge justice</p>
