      <p>well another anon here and i looked at the old school new school video and matthew is not hitting every part of the choreo in the second and third dance for old school, pls do me a favor and watch that video and then talk. the member that was the best overall is gunwook, after gunwook is hanbin then yujin (not alot of difference to hb, the dance just looks a lil easier than the old school one) and matthew is automatically last cause he missed multiple steps in TWO dances</p>
