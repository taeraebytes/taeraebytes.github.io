      <p>well hao does have the biggest fandom over in china, it wouldve been weirder if he WASNT getting more engagements than ricky 💀 ricky on the other hand has intl fans on a choke hold. just go and look at his IG posts numbers. hao will not be going back to china so the numbers on weibo dont really matter. ricky has a brighter future (intl) ahead of him</p>
