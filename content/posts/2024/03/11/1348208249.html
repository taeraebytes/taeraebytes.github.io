      <p>I really wish Hariboz went to the Korean Gucci event. The one in Shanghai was really underwhelming. Itâ€™s been hours since they left the venue and we only got Reporters from like 4(?) Magazine/News Outlets posting one pair of pictures... Is this considered normal for Chinese Events? It is really nice that Gucci booked them their hotel and everything tho.</p>

      <p>They're more in demand in korea than they are in china so yea it makes sense when they have much higher profile celebs at the eventðŸ˜­ they're a cool D list in china

      <p>Before anyone takes this any kind of way Iâ€™m just repeating what I saw my rosin moots saying ðŸ˜­ but there was this circle of them saying that the yuehua staff went with them because yuehua got them this gig which ig makes sense why they went to the China one ( yuehua has way more power there) than to the kr which tbh would have made more sense. Though I agree with what anon said there is a lot of fansite pics going around but there isnâ€™t a lot of press I think it would have been better to go to the kr event because the artist that went there werenâ€™t as high profile so like hanbin isnâ€™t a hugeee artist in korea but like you said they are big enough to the point he had over 200 articles written about him and was on all the fashion pages that went there that day 10+ ? I think had not so many a listers gone they probably would have gotten way more coverage or if they had gone to the kr even they would have gotten way more media and articles.</p>

      <p>I agree there's a celebrity gap at the Shanghai event and the kr event they would've got the same treatment as hanbin pretty much but I hope they start choosing events more carefully
