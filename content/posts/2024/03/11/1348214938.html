      <p>I really wish Hariboz went to the Korean Gucci event. The one in Shanghai was really underwhelming. It‚Äôs been hours since they left the venue and we only got Reporters from like 4(?) Magazine/News Outlets posting one pair of pictures... Is this considered normal for Chinese Events? It is really nice that Gucci booked them their hotel and everything tho.</p>

      <p>They're more in demand in korea than they are in china so yea it makes sense when they have much higher profile celebs at the eventüò≠ they're a cool D list in china

      <p>Before anyone takes this any kind of way I‚Äôm just repeating what I saw my rosin moots saying üò≠ but there was this circle of them saying that the yuehua staff went with them because yuehua got them this gig which ig makes sense why they went to the China one ( yuehua has way more power there) than to the kr which tbh would have made more sense. Though I agree with what anon said there is a lot of fansite pics going around but there isn‚Äôt a lot of press I think it would have been better to go to the kr event because the artist that went there weren‚Äôt as high profile so like hanbin isn‚Äôt a hugeee artist in korea but like you said they are big enough to the point he had over 200 articles written about him and was on all the fashion pages that went there that day 10+ ? I think had not so many a listers gone they probably would have gotten way more coverage or if they had gone to the kr even they would have gotten way more media and articles.</p>

      <p>I agree there's a celebrity gap at the Shanghai event and the kr event they would've got the same treatment as hanbin pretty much but I hope they start choosing events more carefully

      <p>you people are so... they literally went there to promote themselves and the group and get more exposure like what? the way so many fashion bloggers and big accounts on wb posted about them today especially zhang hao like that's the purpose, for them to get exposure</p>

      <p>ok uhm someone just expressed their disappointment at the lack of press calm down like ppl gotta understand they're not big in china at all and attended an event with huge a listers yes they went to get their name out but it's also true there's less press than what they'd get had they gone to the kr Gucci event it's ok to say that like u act like anons just shot someone üò≠.... they got articles ab them and they're getting attention but like anon said hanbin got what 200+? there's a differencnennfnfnnfndm and idk based off the vibe of the videos it just felt that way BUT AGAIN THEY WERE W HUGE A LISTERSSSS CALM DOWNNNNN the event wasn't a flop but they had a taste of smth different this time

      <p>ndkkckcjxjdkd it's just ridiculous to compare like this is their first ever domestic schedule in their country where they never promoted, plus why are yall gagged by 200 naver articles when they had 282829 posts about them today with 10X more engagement than on those articles? And tbh the event in Shanghai was much more luxurious and the celebrities attending were so famous, yet Hao's engagements were the most among them all in 9/10 cases like you people just aren't on weibo and still base things off of fuckass naver when this is an event in china ‚ò†Ô∏è it went pretty well for a first schedule there</p>

      <p>I guess but again this was just someone expressing their disappointment like I'm sorry I don't check weibo or Chinese platforms often to know all that so yknow I'm just talking and saying what I think which I said it's ok because it's their first event and they were with a listers......üò≠. And be fuckinf calm yo like are u crazy who is basing shit off of naver ANON LITERALLT SAID ITS NOT MUCH TO COMPARE BUT IN REFERENCEEEEEE PLZ DONT IRKKKKKKKKK like this miskeen anon was just relaying what they heard and said don't jump me u hoes cant go one day without getting offended at smth dumb

      <p>anon i dont know what posts from actual reporters or photographers youre talking about. there were a total of 8 max. of course the fans are going to hype this event up, interact and post alot about it. the problem are the people inside the venue. if you search for any official picture (doesnt matter if on weibo or twitter) you will see the same ones floating around. what wouldve happened if no fansites were allowed in? we would have been starving. nobody is saying its going to be like events on naver. weibo is the intl version of twitter. i still expected more pictures from official profiles/sites. this shanghai event was underwhelming, they shouldve went to the one in korea</p>

      <p>but I feel like this definitely gave those two exposure like they may have had low press but word of their attendance and fans spreading stuff is good because someone in here said that fashion events are taken a lot more serious in china than they are in korea which I believe so both things can exist yes the press was disappointing but I also feel like if they just did Gucci korea it's a lot more forgettable there wasn't as many high profile celebs there either so idk
