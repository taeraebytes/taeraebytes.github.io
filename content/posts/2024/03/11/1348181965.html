      <p>When hao did tmi at weekly idol saying he accompany hanbin in paris and the minutes later you'll have hanbin on bubble talking "NO it's actually gyuvin". Until today, i don't know the reason why he did that, is he trying to say hao was lying? Idk he seems weird for that moment for me</p>

      <p>Eh basically during weekly idol Hao told the story but he only kept his part of the story and talked about how he comforted hanbin and then him and hanbin got drunk on the yacht (I am guessing that mr no alcohol or else we are not friends anymore wasn't with them during this part of the story). Then Hanbin went on bbl idk if someone asked or if he brought it up bc the episode came out but basically he said that he also wanted to thank gyuvin and that he didn't talk about it during the episode but Gyuvin basically comforted him for a while too and he hugged Hanbin for a long time.

So no he didn't say that Hao lied or anything like that. Both things happened the order was: Gyuvin comforting him, then Hao comforting him, them I guess that Gyuvin left then and the two of them started drinking until they got drunk I guess. And that's when their staff took those pics of Hao with Hanbin at the yacht on where Hao looks kinda lit</p>

      <p>non you making your own timeline anon, no one knows what happened, who comforted who first and who left. All we know is right after the weekly idol ep came out and hao talked about how he comforted hanbin and both got drunk tgt (hanbin agreed), hanbin goes right to bubble to talk about how gyuvin comforted him with no mention of hao lmao which was a little weird lmao especially since it was right after the ep came out.</p>

      <p>I feel like I usually can say what I think about everyone's personalities clearly on here except for hanbin just cuz of the harassment but now that I'm free as a bird lemme start. I'm obviously not mentioning this cuz idk idrc ab it but it's funny u say this anon cuz I'm ngl I feel like hanbin sometimes says or does things that make me go ????? Like he can be so slick mouthed omitting things or pointing out certain things and there's always some kind of destruction that follows mi don't like thatttt

      <p>I'm just using anon to say what I feel esp since I've never said it before cuz of how ppl act here😒 not that I think the paris thing matters to me or has to do with what I said. but anon was getting at smth I feel like I've seen before in a diff scenario and I don't think it's fair I've never said my opinion on hanbins personality in particular here when I do it to everyone

      <p>aside from things I choose not to post just because theyre very uhmmmmm idk the word like nobody should post that but ppl have talked ab haos financial history, childhood (to the bone) and even his dad not to mention what they think ab his personality😭. I say rosins run this cc but they rlly don't.. it's a joke. I have more gossipy anons than anything else. And girl gunwook gets dragged by these dumb hoes all the time I mean there rlly isn't much to dissect but when the January incident happened it was upppp. gpds are also new to my cc and I choose not to talk ab gunwook unless he's brought up cuz this isn't a bias cc, which I've stated probably 1 million times. I find it so funny when anons who have been here for what? 1 month? try to say this because you do not know shiiite ab the history here please don't talk ab nun if you haven't been here since November AT LEAST cuz now ur just irking me with these lies🤦‍♀️
