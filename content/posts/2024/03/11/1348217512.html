      <p>they do this to both hao and ricky which is why if you saw their weibo live after todays event both of them had like a pink ring around their lips ðŸ˜­ i dont really think the lip style looks bad on them tho since they both already have nice lips</p>

      <p>the way that their MUA does the makeup differently according to the member is so funny to me:

yujin gets the standard cute idol korean makeup, like blush here and there sometimes a little bit of glitter.

matthew gets bare minimum

gunwook is a mix of yujin and matthew

for Jiwoong they make him look like a vampire, they be using baby powder at this point with how pale they make him

Ricky with the douyin makeup

Hao the gg makeup

Hanbin almost goes barefaced except for the crazy ass aegyo sal makeup that they always give him, his makeup gives nayeon and momo from twice during 2021 on where people would say that it looked like they had worms on their aegyo sal

Taerae gets the 2014 male idol makeup

Gyuvin a mix between Hanbin and Taerae</p>
