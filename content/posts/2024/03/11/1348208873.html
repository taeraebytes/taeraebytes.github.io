      <p>I really wish Hariboz went to the Korean Gucci event. The one in Shanghai was really underwhelming. It‚Äôs been hours since they left the venue and we only got Reporters from like 4(?) Magazine/News Outlets posting one pair of pictures... Is this considered normal for Chinese Events? It is really nice that Gucci booked them their hotel and everything tho.</p>

      <p>They're more in demand in korea than they are in china so yea it makes sense when they have much higher profile celebs at the eventüò≠ they're a cool D list in china

      <p>Before anyone takes this any kind of way I‚Äôm just repeating what I saw my rosin moots saying üò≠ but there was this circle of them saying that the yuehua staff went with them because yuehua got them this gig which ig makes sense why they went to the China one ( yuehua has way more power there) than to the kr which tbh would have made more sense. Though I agree with what anon said there is a lot of fansite pics going around but there isn‚Äôt a lot of press I think it would have been better to go to the kr event because the artist that went there weren‚Äôt as high profile so like hanbin isn‚Äôt a hugeee artist in korea but like you said they are big enough to the point he had over 200 articles written about him and was on all the fashion pages that went there that day 10+ ? I think had not so many a listers gone they probably would have gotten way more coverage or if they had gone to the kr even they would have gotten way more media and articles.</p>

      <p>I agree there's a celebrity gap at the Shanghai event and the kr event they would've got the same treatment as hanbin pretty much but I hope they start choosing events more carefully

      <p>you people are so... they literally went there to promote themselves and the group and get more exposure like what? the way so many fashion bloggers and big accounts on wb posted about them today especially zhang hao like that's the purpose, for them to get exposure</p>

      <p>ok uhm someone just expressed their disappointment at the lack of press calm down like ppl gotta understand they're not big in china at all and attended an event with huge a listers yes they went to get their name out but it's also true there's less press than what they'd get had they gone to the kr Gucci event it's ok to say that like u act like anons just shot someone üò≠.... they got articles ab them and they're getting attention but like anon said hanbin got what 200+? there's a differencnennfnfnnfndm and idk based off the vibe of the videos it just felt that way BUT AGAIN THEY WERE W HUGE A LISTERSSSS CALM DOWNNNNN the event wasn't a flop but they had a taste of smth different this time
