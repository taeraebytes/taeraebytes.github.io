      <p>I really wish Hariboz went to the Korean Gucci event. The one in Shanghai was really underwhelming. Itâ€™s been hours since they left the venue and we only got Reporters from like 4(?) Magazine/News Outlets posting one pair of pictures... Is this considered normal for Chinese Events? It is really nice that Gucci booked them their hotel and everything tho.</p>

      <p>They're more in demand in korea than they are in china so yea it makes sense when they have much higher profile celebs at the eventðŸ˜­ they're a cool D list in china
