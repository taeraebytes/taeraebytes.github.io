      <p>from pannchoa lolz

so basically this is a conversation between HSH and her friend, letâ€™s call the friend A. Hereâ€™s what happened:

1. A used to date Eunseok from RIIZE, apparently they broke up a year ago but still talked up until Nov 2023. One of the conversations between A and HSH was HSH asking A if she could set her up with Sungchan or Wonbin.
2. HSH hit up Hyunjin from SKZ to sleep with her, he said yes but backed out last minute because he was scared of being caught by his sasaengs

Those are the main big things but some other parts of the conversation that have gone viral on ktwt:
- Wonbinâ€™s real height is 168cm
- Eunseok and sungchan donâ€™t get along
- Hyunjinâ€™s real height is 172cm (a lot of stuff about Hyunjin but i couldnâ€™t understand the translation)
- HSH insulted skz a lot, called changbin ugly
- Exposes that hyunjin has a one sided crush on Karina
- HSH pretty much said a d*ath thr*at to haechan for no reason ðŸ˜­
- A and HSH were discussing their male idol types, the tone of the conversation was really gross, like they were picking products off a shelf and it was really objectifying, names that came up were Taeyong, Yeonjun, Jaehyun, Hyunjin, Heeseung
- HSH REALLY wants yeonjun (?) ðŸ˜­

thatâ€™s all i remember

A is Dion lee/ Kim Ye in??? Idk who that is tho

But thatâ€™s the gist of whatâ€™s happening, if you search HSH or any of these make idols names in korean youâ€™ll get more info</p>

      <p>Oh yea I gave a summary about this here already the A you're referring to theonly/kim yein/kim jiwon. hsh brought up wonbin cuz she said she doesn't want him cuz he's 168cm but she was saying she wanted sungchan real bad and she noticed he loved chrome hearts and she'll get him all the chrome hearts and she loves this 01 boy blah blah blah. She was joking ab the 172 thing for hyunjin she was basically insulting him and the things that u couldn't get from the translations are the text messages between him and hsh. We read the entire thing it's so long the gist is they started this for the intention of a romantic set up but hyunjin rlly just ended up seeking her out as a friend (he's sooooo dumb like he was rlly putting trust into her and everything they talked ab added up ex: his finger injury, his trip to Okinawa, him preferring to be referred to by his full name etc.) even tho he ended up meeting her alone in her apartment/hotel room. hed talk ab his one sided love to hsh and how he cherishes his friendship with karina but he's upset that he can't have her basically.

And she didn't give a death threat to haechan she said she would rather commit a crime and murder someone than be put on with haechan SHE SPILLLEDDDDD. 

I wasn't gonna answer this because I already stated everything u said but I didn't go into detail ab hyunjins thing and it's theeeee most detailed drop and has like 10+ screenshots from kkt imsg ab it.

And eunseoks thing is getting worse because he believed his ex when she lied ab being pregnant and he sent her money for an abortion and he had a breakdown now ppl are starting to tweak ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
