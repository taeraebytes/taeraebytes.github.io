      <p>When hao did tmi at weekly idol saying he accompany hanbin in paris and the minutes later you'll have hanbin on bubble talking "NO it's actually gyuvin". Until today, i don't know the reason why he did that, is he trying to say hao was lying? Idk he seems weird for that moment for me</p>

      <p>Eh basically during weekly idol Hao told the story but he only kept his part of the story and talked about how he comforted hanbin and then him and hanbin got drunk on the yacht (I am guessing that mr no alcohol or else we are not friends anymore wasn't with them during this part of the story). Then Hanbin went on bbl idk if someone asked or if he brought it up bc the episode came out but basically he said that he also wanted to thank gyuvin and that he didn't talk about it during the episode but Gyuvin basically comforted him for a while too and he hugged Hanbin for a long time.

So no he didn't say that Hao lied or anything like that. Both things happened the order was: Gyuvin comforting him, then Hao comforting him, them I guess that Gyuvin left then and the two of them started drinking until they got drunk I guess. And that's when their staff took those pics of Hao with Hanbin at the yacht on where Hao looks kinda lit</p>

      <p>non you making your own timeline anon, no one knows what happened, who comforted who first and who left. All we know is right after the weekly idol ep came out and hao talked about how he comforted hanbin and both got drunk tgt (hanbin agreed), hanbin goes right to bubble to talk about how gyuvin comforted him with no mention of hao lmao which was a little weird lmao especially since it was right after the ep came out.</p>

      <p>I feel like I usually can say what I think about everyone's personalities clearly on here except for hanbin just cuz of the harassment but now that I'm free as a bird lemme start. I'm obviously not mentioning this cuz idk idrc ab it but it's funny u say this anon cuz I'm ngl I feel like hanbin sometimes says or does things that make me go ????? Like he can be so slick mouthed omitting things or pointing out certain things and there's always some kind of destruction that follows mi don't like thatttt

      <p>I feel like ik what you mean because as much as we don't know someone's true intentions, it's very interesting that i can think of at least 10 diff incidents off of the top of my head where hb has said/done things that were just weird considering the context, and by consequence led his fans to harass/shade the other members or just be annoying, so many recent ones too but lemme not wake that tea up.</p>

      <p>Nah I think the main problem here is that Hanbin and Hao go and tell their fans when something is up with them, Hanbin doing that and iirc around the same time Zhanghao did that live on where he told his fans about how he fought with Hanbin like why are you even saying that shit when you know how your fans get? They be doing too much, and Hanbin should also stop getting Gyuvin added into the mix too.</p>

      <p>yea I think they can say whatever but at one point everyones gotta learn how their fans act like normal ppl won't care but things blow up so fast round these parts and then it make u think ab intentions and stuff and that's where we come in to get crazy ab it🙆‍♀️

      <p>rosins were calling allins crazy when they said that zh shouldn't have done that or when they also got kinda angry when ZH went and said to a fan that in the future he would've asked hanbin if he repented for not treating him better. but imo those are one of the few times on where allins had a point. 

they both know how crazy their fans are yet when they have discussions they hurry to their fans and make it everyone else problem. like they make fun of taerae all the time for being a T but the thing here is that the two of them are just too emotional ugh</p>

      <p>Again I don't think there was intention to incite anything but yea he probably shouldn't have said that to a fan nfjrjcnndkdkfnmfmdmd like that's a joke for the members or hanbin like if he said that to me I would've been like whatttt😅😂😂😂😂 but everyone's reacts diff

      <p>Diff anon i agree with yall but i feel like the point is that allins always try to shade the other members and make them look like bad people who have evil intentions (except for their token members gyujin ofc) based on interpretations and twisting their words, they've seriously been doing that since debut from the leeching allegations to calling them self-centered and whatnot so it's interesting to see the narrative swapped for once because if they can do that to the other members the same can be done for hanbin 🤷‍♀️ and i feel bad because a lot of what anons are saying is def fueled by the things his fans have been doing to the other members idk</p>
