      <p>Unpopular Opinion: But Lee jeonghyeon is better than Zhang Hao. His Visual are Top Tier, He has great stage presence which I personally don't see in hao. This is my opinion please be nice.</p>

      <p>soooooo if his visuals are well received does that not entail the title? I think you mean he might not fit the kbs but I don't think fitting it or not fitting it actually means smth to me but ig obv for korea fitting to it it's of value
