      <p>It's bc the staff is obsessed with felix ugh so the other members get crumbs and then we have Bang Chan annoying ass defending the staff like I know he's sick. Well for someone who used to shade him he was all up Hyunjin ass during all of February he even took pics with Hyunjin Versace glasses like???

Also his actor friends are a lot, they are like 4 ugh. Normal people have 6-10 friends so idk why he wanted to find other friends and then HSH called him bitchy but he was nice to her lmao</p>
