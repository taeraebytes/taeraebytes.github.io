      <p>well hao does have the biggest fandom over in china, it wouldve been weirder if he WASNT getting more engagements than ricky 💀 ricky on the other hand has intl fans on a choke hold. just go and look at his IG posts numbers. hao will not be going back to china so the numbers on weibo dont really matter. ricky has a brighter future (intl) ahead of him</p>

      <p>well what now is that ricky could make hundred thousands with one IG post whereas hao would have to smell his ssg breaths, get stalked 24/7 and work everyday  seven days a week to earn the same amount of money ricky makes with one IG post. idol life is just a hobby for ricky, he will be the one that ends up on top.</p>
