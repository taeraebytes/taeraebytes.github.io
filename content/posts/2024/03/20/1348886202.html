      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>As a seokryu I will also say seokryus used to be very nasty and a lot of them were genuinely terrible but at some point even the worst accs learned that Matthew would get dragged and shut upüôè I still don't like a lot of them but I'm glad they're not that dumb at least</p>
