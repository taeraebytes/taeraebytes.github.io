      <p>maybe really random but at the beginning i was really happy that the boys were in bubble but now looking back at it, its probably one of the worst decisions wakeone couldve done. the only pro is that the boys get money from bubble subs. in terms of promotion or exposure its doing nothing for the group. it was alright when at the beginning wakeone had members do frequent IG lives but now thats gone and fans/casuals have almost nothing with where they can keep up with the group. w1 has to do something about that or zb1 wont get bigger in fandom size/recognision (not that w1 minds that)</p>

      <p>Yea I thought it would be a good move at first since everyone operates on bubble but it's so limiting for them and there is virtually nothing else to get content with they're not doing free lives they're not active on twitter they post sporadically on ig and tiktok they don't have self made content to fall back on its a mess
