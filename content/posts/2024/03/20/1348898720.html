      <p>Ok my prediction; Jiwoong big scandal (probably starts w attitude and his dating gets exposed again after), I can also see Hao say something reckless prob fatphobic only ifans will care, Hanbin is retouching his eyelids and gets into a controversy about him being dishonest with the fans but it won't affect him much, Gyuvin controversy and it sours his mood for a while, Gunwook controversy MAYBE but I'm feeling it for 2025 instead</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ can we move gunwooks to 2026? But I don't think hanbin would like lie ab anything to anyone hed probably just get smth done and get dragged major jiwoong would probably have a huge scandal but it's better than somebody else ig and gyuvin yea probably
