      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>As a seokryu I will also say seokryus used to be very nasty and a lot of them were genuinely terrible but at some point even the worst accs learned that Matthew would get dragged and shut upüôè I still don't like a lot of them but I'm glad they're not that dumb at least</p>

      <p>And it's the complete opposite for rosins üò≠ they used to be big ot9, seeing how a lot of zerose dgaf about hao unless to say he is gay, rosins were seriously tired when antis with big following were making homophobic and xenophobic cmts, zerose were nowhere to be found but when a rosin troll acc with 1 like says something they'd be all up in the quotes sigh they all still behave like that, they dgaf about hao hate unless another member is involved and now a lot of the fandom are solos (ofc nasty akgaes too).</p>

      <p>mmmmmmmmmmmmm idk I don't think it's fair to accuse thatü§î just being in ot9 spaces before and being present for this so called "new dawn of rosin transformation" into solos I feel like the issue is that zeroses and rosins in general are new to kpop the type of expectations on both sides are so unrealistic. If you take a look at most kzeroses they carry on just fine and most active public fans are ot9 you'll see your trolls fans your solo fans and akgaes are usually on private but that's usually how intl kpop spaces used to be. the zerose fandom has been nothing but a shit show but the sentiment of ot9 fans bashing hao and rosins just isn't that stark/targeted and also a chain reaction of just booty times. At the end of the day people will care about their biases the most and coming from a survival show you absolutely cannot expect a brand new fandom space to be unified just like that, theres definitely fault in the company for not having the resources and content to create that bridge and also the slew of favoritism but also this isn't the first kpop fandom or kpop survival show group I've been into this for years and zeroses seriously shock me at how stupid they areüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ ot9s are ot9s there isn't a secret hate agenda and the rosins who turned into solos just wanted to be solos they weren't back into a corner by "evil zeroses" and I've also never seen an entire fandom take opinions and takes to the highest level of fact it's like closing ur eyes isn't a thing anymore lolllll

      <p>ok show me also for every ot9 acc that "dgaf" hao there is an ot9 acc that "dgaf" the other 8 members. LIEK DO U WANT THESE PEOPEL TO HAVE SET DAILY QUOTAS ON WHO TO TWEET AB üò≠üò≠üò≠????? I'm truly trying to understand like u do get how rankings work right? Someone or some people are gonna be last so ofc folks will be less inclined to talk ab members in the bottom of their list like someone has to be at the bottom..... and since when we're centered fans tweet watching proclaimed ot9s like do you even hear yourself they have favorites tooüò≠üò≠üò≠ just cuz it looks like they "dgaf" to you doesn't mean they hate them like it's soooo obvious that y'all are new to kpop stan spaces. The shit you guys focus on us so childish tbh
