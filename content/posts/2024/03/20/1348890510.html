      <p>I remember people talking yesterday about what they think the boys will do post disbandment and I have a new theory for hanbin. The artist development director ( trainee development director ) just posted a video of his ad in shibuya on her story and I though maybe she’d come to Japan for the concert but it turns out his company is holding international auditions and they have about 5 days worth of auditions in Japan. Previously their audition age range was like 2006-2014 so no one thought anything of it because hanbin was their only trainee so there’s no way they would put him in a group with 06 liners as an 01 and a potential youngest of 2014, but they recently changed their audition age range to start at 2002. To me this this made it really clear they have plans to redebut him in a group under their own company ( there’s no guarantee he will stay) but they seem to be preparing in the case he does.</p>
