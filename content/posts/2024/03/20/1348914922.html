      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>As a seokryu I will also say seokryus used to be very nasty and a lot of them were genuinely terrible but at some point even the worst accs learned that Matthew would get dragged and shut upüôè I still don't like a lot of them but I'm glad they're not that dumb at least</p>

      <p>And it's the complete opposite for rosins üò≠ they used to be big ot9, seeing how a lot of zerose dgaf about hao unless to say he is gay, rosins were seriously tired when antis with big following were making homophobic and xenophobic cmts, zerose were nowhere to be found but when a rosin troll acc with 1 like says something they'd be all up in the quotes sigh they all still behave like that, they dgaf about hao hate unless another member is involved and now a lot of the fandom are solos (ofc nasty akgaes too).</p>

      <p>mmmmmmmmmmmmm idk I don't think it's fair to accuse thatü§î just being in ot9 spaces before and being present for this so called "new dawn of rosin transformation" into solos I feel like the issue is that zeroses and rosins in general are new to kpop the type of expectations on both sides are so unrealistic. If you take a look at most kzeroses they carry on just fine and most active public fans are ot9 you'll see your trolls fans your solo fans and akgaes are usually on private but that's usually how intl kpop spaces used to be. the zerose fandom has been nothing but a shit show but the sentiment of ot9 fans bashing hao and rosins just isn't that stark/targeted and also a chain reaction of just booty times. At the end of the day people will care about their biases the most and coming from a survival show you absolutely cannot expect a brand new fandom space to be unified just like that, theres definitely fault in the company for not having the resources and content to create that bridge and also the slew of favoritism but also this isn't the first kpop fandom or kpop survival show group I've been into this for years and zeroses seriously shock me at how stupid they areüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ ot9s are ot9s there isn't a secret hate agenda and the rosins who turned into solos just wanted to be solos they weren't back into a corner by "evil zeroses" and I've also never seen an entire fandom take opinions and takes to the highest level of fact it's like closing ur eyes isn't a thing anymore lolllll

      <p>i am a hao one pick but i stanned the whole group until the recent hanbin truck discourse and the insane sinophobic attack against rosins when there was literally no proof that rosins were behind those trucks. i unstanned the group but i still like almost all members and i sometimes hype their schedules but i would never call myself a zerose. and i know atleast 20 rosins who stopped stanning the group after that clusterfuck of a week. i saw how zeroses started being sinophobic towards chinese fans because of a mistranslated post by a KNOWN hao anti and when rosins started bringing up stuff from weibo and posted proofs of akages being horrible to hao, ot8 supertopic and all those things, no one other than hao biased people gaf. zb1oomfs, one of the biggest ot9 account apologized for interacting with that misleading post but didn't spare a retweet for the tweet clarifying the mistranslation. if this is how the fandom acts, how are people supposed to stay as ot9?</p>

      <p>yea the fandom is frustrating that's why I create my own space like truly creating ur own subtwt interacting with trusted acc and mutuals u like it's possible. and I'm sorry u had to see all that but maybe cuz the fandoms so new it hasn't broken up into the regular niches yet for ex. sorry I just keep using deobitwt as a reference but the people I interacted with an accs that we chose to put up as our big accs genuinely created its own subtwt generally never expect everyone to smart because they're not that's just how fandoms spaces work. I have zb1oomfs blocked they're just annoying as shit I'm sure it was disheartening to see but I just know from what I put out I tried to stay objective and I do have a pretty big audience also my own tl and fandom space was being pretty logical as well it's really all where you look towards if you have the capacity to enjoy the group I think you can call urself a fan cuz that's literally what it means. Ok idky I'm preaching all this like I haven't had my full blown akgae moments but it's possible to be a solo it's possible to be an akgae if most of your driving force is from the fandom and constant aggression and fighting i think it's fair to give being a fan a chance and not subject urself to constant anger. Like I'm still unsure of what to call myself I enjoy the group too much to say I'm a peaceful solo who just gets aggravated quickly like I'm definitely clear ab my stances on the members individually but I think I can say I'm a zerose or a fan of the group cuz when it's lit it's litttt. For me it's just that it can get a little contradictory running this cc because other fans wouldn't consider me one. But at the end of the day you do you I'm not even qualified to speak I've been banished from all zerose spacesüòÜ

      <p>hi i've never sent a cc before but anon's situation is the same as me and i'm sure a lot of rosins feel this way too... i felt really disheartened during the covid-19 fansign issue but i continued to try my best to be a zerose-rosin up until the truck situation. i'm chinese diaspora myself and it was really hurtful to wake up to ppl from my own fandom, some of whom were my moots, say sinophobic things about cfans. what's worse is that it was over a mistranslation that was used purposefully by hao antis to make it seem like rosins are behind it. i remember later some rosins had enough and brought over some proofs of other akgaes being horrible to hao on weibo, like those screenshots of a allin akgae whose a hao anti and had sent death threats to him getting into a fansign and till this day we don't know what that akgae has said to hao's face. but none of the intl zeroses who claim to be ot9 gaf, they were still going on about how cfans bully everyone except hao and that cfans are the worst and whatnot even though those trucks originated from kforums. they've already formed a bias against cfans and rosins so... idk what i expected from a fandom who fell for mnet's sinophobic storylines during bp anyway. same with anon i dont call myself a zerose now because i dont feel safe in the fandom anymore but i still rt and hype up the other members' schedules because i like the group. i just hate this fandomüòìlike requeef said that we should just create our own space, after that situation i just interact with my close moots now and try to ignore the negativity. i blocked the people who were being sinophobic and it's been more peaceful for me since</p>

      <p>That's understandable tbh I enjoy the group too and seriously keep to my own space and even if I wanted to call myself a zerose I can't I've branded already lol but yea I think to me at least you can still consider urself a fan if u still hype the group and engage in content it's just about abandoning the fandom ig. Like I interact with my friends not zeroses and it's enjoyable I wish I was still able to be public but yea you can't expect much from ppl who were stupid from the start it's why I still do this annoying cc cuz at least people will be honest and it can be fun I hope things stay peaceful for u!!

      <p>The fact is a lot of others sfs can complain the same as rosins if y‚Äôall keep only focusing on the bad apples. I didn‚Äôt see zeroses helping when hanbin received trucks, not even the 2nd time. If we act like you we could also say it‚Äôs the reason we turn akgaes but no we ain‚Äôt doing that. I‚Äôm moot with bigggg allins accounts and till today they post hao and hype him yes there are big akgaes like clover and her clique but you have also big akgaes like droid on rosins side but only 1 side is always complaining we are tired, and they keep accusing shbg team of being hao anti when most of them (i am moot with 3 main admin) are like the sweetest. Today tofu a big hao acc got asked not to post shb again but she said No, but akgae will never see the good ones they only focus on the bad things it‚Äôs tiring.</p>
