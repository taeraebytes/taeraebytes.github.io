      <p>If siblings share almost identical features ur gonna be able to tell what's done and what's not they both have the same nose and face shape so besides his chin I don't see much the alarplasty I can see but also debatable. Like with gyuvins siblings they all looked so diff from him feature wise but u could tell they were siblings and hanbins sister looks like his old photos like whatðŸ˜­???

      <p>It's also why I think wonyoung got less invasive things done than people accuse her of after I saw her sister. Aside from what we pointed out yesterday they look the same her sister just has a longer face.</p>
