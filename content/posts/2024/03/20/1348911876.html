      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>Lmao. especially the admins of zhg were they're always getting mass qrted or dragged by rosin akgaes and solos for supporting the whole group üòÇ

I remember Roxy getting so much hate by rosin akgaes for supporting hanbin while also getting hate from Allins saying she hates hanbin üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>

      <p>Kinda related but who remember this translator that for free live translated every zb1 lives and got ran off because they were a Matthew anti during bp, pisses me off to this day because we haven't had any ot9 live translators since and clearly she likes him if she took it upon herself to translate his thongs for free like omg</p>

      <p>But it's annoying cause for me personally I don't wanna follow like 12 different accs to keep up with the members I care about especially if it puts their sf in my tl like obviously I block and move on but I'd rather have one overall acc for everybody</p>

      <p>No I get youuuu we used to have one big acc back in my deobi days and they got ran off/left in 2021 it genuinely became a shit show after that people don't realize how important it is to have full group accs
