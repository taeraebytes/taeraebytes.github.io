    "reply": "Idk but it's true they're treated like royalty. I think it's because they can get so popular and it's easy to promote and grow and usually jfans shower them with love so ig they always love those vibes? Ngl kfans are who they interact with 24/7 and they can be hard to please? Idk that's the vibe I get and they face public opinion and it's easier to face scrutiny so they might treat jfans like a \"fresh breath\" it's interesting how most bgs ALWAYS treat their jfans better ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I think the fetish plays a little part in it too it's kind of crazy"
