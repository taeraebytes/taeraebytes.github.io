      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>Lmao. especially the admins of zhg were they're always getting mass qrted or dragged by rosin akgaes and solos for supporting the whole group üòÇ

I remember Roxy getting so much hate by rosin akgaes for supporting hanbin while also getting hate from Allins saying she hates hanbin üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>

      <p>I'm trying to follow ur point but those two events manifested from two completely different things but I don't rlly see people using the hate hao got post finale against other fans unlike the truck issue which I think was originally misconstrued and just snowballed into destruction

      <p>I'm too lazy to argue üòû anyway I just feel it's unfair that matthew got a lot of hate, got send trucks, death threats, even his family getting harassed etc for y'all to dismiss it saying people just hate for fun at least acknowledge you're wrong for being evil and nasty to him</p>

      <p>What trucks did Matthew get? But yea I don't think he should have gotten bullied like that but did the translator do any of that???? I'm just saying had nobody exposed her private acc it would've been running normally and opinions change I get hating the acc but I also get what we lost

      <p>Matthew was absolutely hated for fun but I feel like people forget that the truck wasn't about his height or visuals or anything it was about lack of transparency from mnet about Matthew like for the visual vote, allegedly paying YouTubers to promote him etc he obviously didn't deserve any hate and most of ktwt did hate him for his looks but you also need to understand that manipulation of votes in this franchise is a source of trauma over there lol</p>

      <p>Yea I'm ngl my bp corner was in a panic because everything was soooo unclear ab matthrw and manipulation it's unfair he faced that and I wish he didn't but it did stem from that and had any trainee been under those circumstances the result would've been the same unfortunately

      <p>The shiny boy payola was hilarious, I think their issue was that most of the good looking g trainees were Chinese and they didn't want another one since mjx was already there and Matthew was already a favorite so they put him but it was too obvious, on that note you'll notice that Hanbin Gyuvin and Matthew all had noticeable screentime in the first episode but mjx got absolutely nothing üò≠</p>
