      <p>I'm trying to follow ur point but those two events manifested from two completely different things but I don't rlly see people using the hate hao got post finale against other fans unlike the truck issue which I think was originally misconstrued and just snowballed into destruction

      <p>I'm too lazy to argue ðŸ˜ž anyway I just feel it's unfair that matthew got a lot of hate, got send trucks, death threats, even his family getting harassed etc for y'all to dismiss it saying people just hate for fun at least acknowledge you're wrong for being evil and nasty to him</p>

      <p>What trucks did Matthew get? But yea I don't think he should have gotten bullied like that but did the translator do any of that???? I'm just saying had nobody exposed her private acc it would've been running normally and opinions change I get hating the acc but I also get what we lost

      <p>Matthew was absolutely hated for fun but I feel like people forget that the truck wasn't about his height or visuals or anything it was about lack of transparency from mnet about Matthew like for the visual vote, allegedly paying YouTubers to promote him etc he obviously didn't deserve any hate and most of ktwt did hate him for his looks but you also need to understand that manipulation of votes in this franchise is a source of trauma over there lol</p>

      <p>Yea I'm ngl my bp corner was in a panic because everything was soooo unclear ab matthrw and manipulation it's unfair he faced that and I wish he didn't but it did stem from that and had any trainee been under those circumstances the result would've been the same unfortunately

      <p>Oh you weren't there the rumors didn't come from rosins it wasn't rlly a fandom I'm ngl it was very sketch like it was a compilation of favoritism and there were YouTubers who were paid to make other trainees look bad jiwoong for example and people assumed it came from mnh like the rumors got so bad like I mean they ran through every single bp community that mnh was going to take legal action

      <p>what the fuck are you waffling on about anon i'm crying do yall have proof of accusing rosins of everything or is it just easier to make the biggest sf as a scapegoat... literally no one gives a fuck about matthew enough to pay ppl to say shit about him the rigged and favoritism allegations he had came from everywhere and WITH PROOF. you dont wanna go there next thing we know yall are gonna blame the world ending on us. first it was "rosins are liking tweets about the truck it must be them" with not a single proof when everyone who lurks just a bit on kforums knows it's from kzeroses, yall even ran with mistranslations to accuse c-rosins who didn't even know what was going on just to delete ur vile and sinophobic tweets  wishing death on them and act like nothing happened when ppl cleared the issue and now jiwoong stans are trying it too cause apparently whenever shit goes down let's all point the fingers at rosins even though we have zero proof it's just easier! and fuck zeroses and allins for normalizing this. mind you allins literally paid sojang to write shit against zh but yall dont wanna discuss that lmao go to hell</p>

      <p>Diff anon but this kinda relates to what that anon said earlier about kfans having a more group stan mentality and not many akgaes that's just not true lol if you've been around for a while you'd know kfans are one of the most hypocrite and nastiest people every the difference they do it in their privs and they're too cowardly to be openly hateful, they literally came up with the word akgae like you said remember when that big allin acc who used to post vids (umzmz something )got exposed for being a raging homophobe and sinophobe? And idk if yall notice but the second a k stan account starts getting ratioed they delete so fast or go priv they just can't take the heat at all and that's why a lot of them are nastier in their privs and circles.</p>

      <p>at the end of the day... you can do whatever u want on ur priv that's ur space I quite literally said on public for kfans is always a group stan mentality zeroses here are just dumb and dense and stupid and the shit they get upset at is soooooo lukewarmðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like yes we know kfans can be nasty they are people and they have the capacity to be shit but how they operate is different from how zeroses do and what I'm used to like everyone gets down and nasty on their privs that's how it's always been but zeroses are a different story
