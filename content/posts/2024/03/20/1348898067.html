Like there were SOOO many ot9 zeroses calling out sinophobia on my tl when people started saying that they didn‚Äôt want them to go to china for sinophobic reasons and so many people saying that they should not generalize c-rosins. There were so many ot9s on my tl trending hashtags for hao when he got sick and excluded for the fansigns. There were so many ot9s helping trend the protect hashtags when homophobic articles were being spread about hao even though a lot of us didn‚Äôt even know what was going on at first since y‚Äôall purposely kept it on the dl (which is good but then y‚Äôall blamed US for not knowing what was going on in YOUR private circles). There is no secret hate agenda amongst ot9 zeroses I PROMISE YOU. you guys are just so selective with what you see. if you don‚Äôt follow ot9 zeroses, you are not going to see ot9 zeroses standing up for hao or whoever your bias is. doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist. but that doesn‚Äôt fuel you guys self-victimization agenda does it? and i‚Äôm not gonna act like ot9s are a completely innocent fandom but y‚Äôall blame us for shit that‚Äôs just incorrect üò≠",

      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i‚Äôve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>As a seokryu I will also say seokryus used to be very nasty and a lot of them were genuinely terrible but at some point even the worst accs learned that Matthew would get dragged and shut upüôè I still don't like a lot of them but I'm glad they're not that dumb at least</p>

      <p>And it's the complete opposite for rosins üò≠ they used to be big ot9, seeing how a lot of zerose dgaf about hao unless to say he is gay, rosins were seriously tired when antis with big following were making homophobic and xenophobic cmts, zerose were nowhere to be found but when a rosin troll acc with 1 like says something they'd be all up in the quotes sigh they all still behave like that, they dgaf about hao hate unless another member is involved and now a lot of the fandom are solos (ofc nasty akgaes too).</p>

      <p>mmmmmmmmmmmmm idk I don't think it's fair to accuse thatü§î just being in ot9 spaces before and being present for this so called "new dawn of rosin transformation" into solos I feel like the issue is that zeroses and rosins in general are new to kpop the type of expectations on both sides are so unrealistic. If you take a look at most kzeroses they carry on just fine and most active public fans are ot9 you'll see your trolls fans your solo fans and akgaes are usually on private but that's usually how intl kpop spaces used to be. the zerose fandom has been nothing but a shit show but the sentiment of ot9 fans bashing hao and rosins just isn't that stark/targeted and also a chain reaction of just booty times. At the end of the day people will care about their biases the most and coming from a survival show you absolutely cannot expect a brand new fandom space to be unified just like that, theres definitely fault in the company for not having the resources and content to create that bridge and also the slew of favoritism but also this isn't the first kpop fandom or kpop survival show group I've been into this for years and zeroses seriously shock me at how stupid they areüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ ot9s are ot9s there isn't a secret hate agenda and the rosins who turned into solos just wanted to be solos they weren't back into a corner by "evil zeroses" and I've also never seen an entire fandom take opinions and takes to the highest level of fact it's like closing ur eyes isn't a thing anymore lolllll
