      <p>during the show everyone was under the impression taerae was some soft spoken, awkward (that part was kinda true), quiet church twink but it turns out hes got an ahjumma personality and is on the snappier side ðŸ˜­ Nothing wrong with any of these traits ofc but I deff think it made him lose fans</p>
