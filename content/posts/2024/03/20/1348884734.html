      <p>And a good amount of their votes are from solos, I've seen a few kfans acc that aren't into sfs discover how bad it is through this poll and being dumbfounded that they would rather help out our biggest rival group for a passage in a big magazine, it's not like the terrible state of our fandom is in anyway my fault but the reactions and discussions made me so embarrassed lol</p>
