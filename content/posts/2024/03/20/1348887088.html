      <p>anon remove haos cbar numbers or cut it in half and he would not be number one or two in sales. yall love to talk about sales or streams but everything rosins do is thanks to cfans. there is nothing wrong with having a supportive chinese fandom but it gets funny when rosins who are not chinese try to use these things to drag other subfandoms. cause you youself didnt contribute shit, you wouldnt even be on this CC if you did.</p>
