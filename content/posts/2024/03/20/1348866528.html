      <p>Talking about Ricky as if Gunwook has not done any Surgeries just because his face is fat that doesn't means he has not done any surgery lol.</p>

      <p>tone deaf dumb low iq weak drag and pathetic I could go on but discussing ps for a member who's been accused of every surgery vs a member who's known to have the least amt procedures + was not even the topic of discussion... mmh u rlly are just an airheaded moron I could have just said Ricky was a plastic surgery monster chin filler fiend but I didn't let's worry about his reinvestment in a Natalie clinic for the next 2 yrs rather than being dumb in my cc ugh I was already getting annoyed today but now I'm just irked good day beloved

      <p>HELPPP ???!?!?!??!?!?! 😭😭😭😭 the way you can tell a rosin wrote this so you'll drag Ricky just because ppl aren't agreeing with them SKADJFALSJKDHFJKLASH and you can tell it's rosins because they always bring up weight. Notice how all previous cc's were hao vs ricky then when rosins were losing the argument they suddenly brought gunwook in and used the words that trigger you? I can't rosins are too funny</p>

      <p>I just find it so funny because rosins do this ALL the time 😭😭😭 Trust me I know how they run things I'm one of the rare loud gpds on twitter and I fight with them on a daily they always say the same thing to drag our wookie and when they start losing their battle they change their pfp/ bios to another member so we'll stop dragging Hao and drag whoever they change their pfp to.  I used to fall for it all the time but it's clear as DAYYY. Fuck these rosins.</p>

      <p>There's a good amount but majority lurk and RT posts from Korean and English twitter and fandoms usually stay within their own circle so other members don't really pop up on your TL but I think the biggest solo latam fandoms are Jiwoong Ricky > Matthew Hanbin Gunwook Hao Yujin > Gyuvin > Taerae

But the loudest are rosins 😭 We would make a tweet praising Gunwook's vocals or dancing and they'll just QRT us with a clip of Hao dancing with 4 replies explaining why Hao is a better dancer and there are some OT9 accounts and rosins would camp those too if you compliment another member it's so annoying 😭😭😭 They are also always bring Weibo rumors onto Twitter with no source just to start fights 😭 I just hate them so much no matter how many accounts I block they just make new ones but you can tell it's the same people</p>

      <p>I DO ?!?!?!?!!!?!?!?! 😭😭😭 That's why I said I know how they run things because I fight back. It goes like this, I make a praising tweet about Gunwook and rosins QRT being shady then we fight then mid way through the fight which I am winning a random Ricky account would join the thread and be like "But Gunwook is still fat" and then I'll fight back dragging Ricky. I hated Riyangis so much because of that so then Riyangis would find the tweet and of coarse defend Ricky so they would drag Gunwook and this happened for a long time. But one time I thought it was weird because those cosplay account always show up when rosins are losing and says the same thing and the original 'Ricky' account would be quiet not even defending Ricky when gpds were dragging him so I check their profile and it was a rosin cosplaying 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😭

They do this EVERY TIME cosplaying Ricky Yujin and Hanbin the most but subfandoms now know about their tactics so we kind of formed an allied force between these four fandoms against rosins 🤝</p>
