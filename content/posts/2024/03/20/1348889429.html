      <p>yeah my experience with ot9 zerose twt is mostly seokryus and geonppangdans with some gyuvinists, riyangis, a few kkultaraes and some haobinists

i think in order of most likely to be ot9 to least likely to be ot9 *that i’ve seen* it goes:
gyuvin biased>matthew biased> gunwook biased>haobinist>>yujin biased> taerae biased> jiwoong biased = ricky biased >> hanbin biased = hao biased</p>

      <p>Lmao. especially the admins of zhg were they're always getting mass qrted or dragged by rosin akgaes and solos for supporting the whole group 😂

I remember Roxy getting so much hate by rosin akgaes for supporting hanbin while also getting hate from Allins saying she hates hanbin 😂😂😂😂</p>

      <p>the reality is a lot of rosins solos or akgaes now used to be ot9 during debut but all the big allin psycho akgae accs tested their limits and nobody did anything about it so now these rosins are giving back the same psycho energy to them</p>

      <p>If we're getting nitty gritty everyone was a solo stan for their 1 pick but it's true that rosins and allins alike were going to have huge chunks that operated as akgaes dragging ot9 or just zeroses into it is wild because I'm sorry I saw that coming immediately idk why ppl are surprised it's age old p01 and p02 fans fight 😭😭😭 but this is just fucking annoying cuz they try to run narratives and override real things to talk ab
