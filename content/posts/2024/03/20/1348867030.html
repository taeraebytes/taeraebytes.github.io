<a href="https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared">https://youtu.be/oMQHGAYeDD8?feature=shared</a> Is it bad that I want them to maybe redebut like this? ü•≤ All of them mash so well together, not overpowering each others personalities or anything. They also have a great balance and are actually pleasing to look at when walking together. I love smaller groups maybe that‚Äôs why I feel like this üòÇ</p>

      <p>i feel like when people see members interact like this, they cant really hate any of them/they warm up to them. wakeone is the one always fucking things up. what do you mean we only have zbtv as an ot9 thing but even that is on hiatus rn?? the worst part is that there are 9 members, nobodies relationship gets to shine through zbtv.</p>

      <p>I was rlly thinking like omg I'm just a miskeen schizo girllll if I got content like this I would be so happy and fulfilled and joyful and whimsical all day every day zbtv is decent but for ppl who are stanning a rookie group they want to see the type of realer and rawer constant content that we had on bp and somehow gyuvin was quicker than zbtv itself I hope they let gyuvin on the editing team it was sooo funnnn
