      <p>Idk if you've kept up with the Kate Middleton drama but yesterday TMZ released a low quality video of her allegedly hanging out with William and today they're saying it may be a mistake ðŸ’€I'm convinced this whole thing is a cover up for something else because no way their pr is THAT bad</p>

      <p>I SAW they were out somehwere none of it makes sense like I need to know what they're hiding this is insane. But I also don't believe the royal family is thisss bad that they're allegedly getting caught by tmz I feel like this might be to draw attention towards Kate in this messy way but they're actually hiding smth ab Charles? Maybe he's gonna croak ðŸ¤”
