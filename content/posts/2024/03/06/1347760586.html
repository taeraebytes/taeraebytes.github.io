      <p>I'm still logging out for however long I feel but I saw the rumor that's going around about re-signing and such and because I'm a hub I gotta say smth cuz I'm lowkey irked🤦‍♀️ this rumor sprouted 2 days ago when the mv leak got posted by rosins who were upset that in the 30 second video there was a 1-2 second cut of hao and they just said oh the members that are getting lines and screentime are re-signing and wakeone wants to use them in a jebe2.0😭😭😭 which would allude to Ricky yujin hanbin and Matthew off of that video then they got upset at the one girl who said wow gunwooks in the middle and added him to the rumor I'm sorry as a gunwook fan the company ignores him it would be obvious if they wanted to re-sign him but he's not even close to being a favorite please don't irk me😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 and even after that dinner with the ceo AND yh staff ain't shit changeee they wanna act like gunwook is being treated like a king he most certainly is not this is my humble requeefiem opinion this rumor is so fake and just cope ok bye bye</p>

      <p>the people that made up this rumor are making up rumors about other stuff and they are together too. all absurd (e.g the rk one a day ago) so it certainly isn’t anything serious

also contracts are not that easy to sign on whim, especially two years before disbandment like wakeone does not even know what will happen to zb1 and their status first of all, second of all no original company is gonna let their trainees jump ship that easily cause the members simply decided so</p>
