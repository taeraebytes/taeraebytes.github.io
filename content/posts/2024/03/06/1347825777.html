      <p>It was just one of the female staff put on yujin/taeraes(?) jacket while they were practicing ngl that's pretty weird I see it as a little flirt tactic like that's just smth u see in hs lol. but considering the power dynamic and probably age gaps it raises question but it could very well have been a kind gesture and she was cold but in front of the camerasðŸ˜…? Fans were just enraged that's it people tried to say it's the makeup staff that was with Ricky in london but those ladies probably have a 6 inch height diff can't be her
