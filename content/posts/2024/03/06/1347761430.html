      <p>I'm still logging out for however long I feel but I saw the rumor that's going around about re-signing and such and because I'm a hub I gotta say smth cuz I'm lowkey irked🤦‍♀️ this rumor sprouted 2 days ago when the mv leak got posted by rosins who were upset that in the 30 second video there was a 1-2 second cut of hao and they just said oh the members that are getting lines and screentime are re-signing and wakeone wants to use them in a jebe2.0😭😭😭 which would allude to Ricky yujin hanbin and Matthew off of that video then they got upset at the one girl who said wow gunwooks in the middle and added him to the rumor I'm sorry as a gunwook fan the company ignores him it would be obvious if they wanted to re-sign him but he's not even close to being a favorite please don't irk me😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 and even after that dinner with the ceo AND yh staff ain't shit changeee they wanna act like gunwook is being treated like a king he most certainly is not this is my humble requeefiem opinion this rumor is so fake and just cope ok bye bye</p>

      <p>It’s rosins who started the rumor with no basis at all. Wakeone hate Ricky, Gunwook doesn’t get shit, hanbin’s company wouldn’t still be posting about him and supporting him if he was ditching them, yuehua is never going to let go of Yujin and Matthew most certainly has a foot in for bigger companies post zb1.

Also why on earth would they be talking about contracts and negotiating stuff like that so early into the contract period that’s not something they would have to think about till their last year, even if it is true as a company wakeone wouldn’t sign into anything permanent so early because the trajectory of zb1 can change at any moment. 

Rosins are spreading this to justify their shitty behaviour towards any other member receiving the slightest bit of spotlight and the qrts under that Gunwook middle post showed me they are no better than allins, the moment they viewed Gunwook as a threat they came for him too.
