      <p>Btw requeefuen and fashion anon what do you think of the whole woongsungz magazine issue? I thought it was ridiculous that people were blaming Wakeone for this but then again idk how this all works, also what do you think is the current relation between Wakeone and Gucci</p>

      <p>I got asked ab it earlier and I'm just not surprised like the publisher still wants money they're probably mad af they got them on this edition and it might get fucked over but of course these two particular groups of ppl know nothing ab logic. I'm assuming because they stated the PUBLISHER requested this it's arena what does wakeone have to do with that...?

      <p>Sorry fashion anon again - for the part with the relationship about Gucci, since hanbin was wearing 2 unreleased pieces and 1 pieces that had been released the same week to the airport and jiwoong was wearing things that he bought himself or had been worn before I think it‚Äôs safe to say they have dropped him and are more set on working with hanbin. Idk if there are chill allins in this but cmiif hanbin has wore new season gucci before but none of it has been unreleased however his fit to the ancora event was unreleased too so the fact they are now dressing him in unreleased stuff is a good sign for him. 

Heavy on the airport outfit because this is where my observation comes in, hariboz wore Gucci to China but I think it was all released and they did also dress jun who was flying out to their event so they were probably dressing all the artist. My only reasoning for why they may carry on with only hanbin is because hariboz weren‚Äôt wearing Gucci from China -> Japan ( I think hao wore the bag and shoes he wore from Korea -> China)  again if any of this is wrong please correct me. There was no real reason for them to dress hanbin in unreleased stuff just to travel to Japan afaik he‚Äôs only been dressed at the airport by them for bigger event like Kcon LA, mcountdown in France and award season but not the more casual flights like when they went to London. 

Anons can make their own judgement but just look out for some things and it will be obvious who they want to move forward with:

1) getting invited to future events 
2) getting dressed by them (bonus points if it‚Äôs unreleased stuff)
3) they sent jw + hb flower and cake for debut and comeback keep and eye out and see if they send anything for either Japan debut or kr comeback ( this is probably the biggest indicator)

Side note: I don‚Äôt think the arena magazine will be dressed by Gucci I think it will be like all the other photoshoots zb1 has done where they wear a mix of designer</p>

      <p>diff anon, i'm a lil confused about the gucci thing but i'm no fashion person at all so i have 0 idea of how this works. like, obviously hanbin has a connection with them since he's been to multiple events now and had the cakes with jiwoong and jiwoong was likely dropped, but then u have hariboz with the chinese gucci stuff so they have a connection?????? but then hao also has loewe..... and i remember one time at the airport during earlier days they all wore gucci (it was those blue outfits, think they were going to one of the kcons) so maybe they were trying things out but then i can at least tell that taerae and jiwoong, so probably the rest too, are wearing gucci in the new elle japan shoot so what's going on with them lmao is it an ot9 thing, some members or just hanbin OR something else completely</p>

      <p>So from what I can gauge fashion anon can correct me, dressing for the shoot doesnr have much to do with the brand itself it's just styling and anyone can wear anything but it's also possible for hao to have both sponsorships if both do start that relationship because it's not strict or a representative position like ambassadorship

      <p>Fashion anon - hao definitely can have both, if he isn‚Äôt a ba he doesn‚Äôt owe them exclusivity although some fashion houses do prefer exclusivity . The one time they wore Gucci to LA it seemed like they were testing out with all the members. The photoshoot they did all the members are dressed in unreleased Gucci but a misconception is brand a lot of the time aren‚Äôt exactly sending their clothes specifically for that artist, they are sending them for the visibility of being on the cover of a magazine that will sell well if you get me. The only time brands really do a personal sponsorship for clothes is for those with any sort of ambassador ship for them. E.g if im a brand and i know vogue is going to be putting out a magazine soon and i have a new like dropping soon of course im going to bid for my clothes to be used because that gives me visibility and promotion.</p>

      <p>ouuuuuu yea that makes sense I want them to do more brand testing for the group because at least gpds are pretty good with sales I want gunwook to at least be a name that pops up for these brands this year
