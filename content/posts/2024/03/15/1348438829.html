      <p>Pretty sure the eunseok thing was also fake. SM didn‚Äôt take action for days because they thought it was stupid and would die down, them saying they will take legal action for spreading false rumors, and eunseok saying they didn‚Äôt do anything that would make the fans worry. This would‚Äôve been worse than what happened with seunghan but the different in how SM treated it basically confirms its fabricated bc there wasn‚Äôt any actual apology (seunghan had to apologize and go on hiatus bc his scandal was actually real), also hyunjin was apparently not even in the country on the day han seo hee allegedly tried to hu so if his bit is fake, it‚Äôs likely it was all fake. was funny as hell though LOL</p>

      <p>Uhmmmm no they got theonly on full live recordings üòÖ that shit was realer than real and in the apology eunseok didn't say a single thing but just go off of Anton's points and be like "yea me too" I have my own thoughts ab the truth of Allegra's statement just cuz lying is a thing lol but eunseok got lucky that Anton is just more relevant than him and got more heat and everyone pushed it to the side and he got statements from the involved ppl faster. Me and lotus watched closer than anyoneeee like we lowkey hyper fixated on the scandals we were on the phone sun up to sun down im sorry eunseok soooo did that and the only thing backing it was statements. While Anton was less evidencey and more speculative. Sorry I'm rambling but theonly herself contacted a leaker and she couldn't even tell if the leaker was an acquaintance or not because the info was real she freaked out and even sent her number and a location to meet üò≠
