      <p>This is all just personal taste and from some of the styling that we have seen already and what brands align with that -

Hanbin - Chanel 
Jiwoong - Gucci ( I feel bad because he actually did suit it )
Hao - Prada 
Matthew - 
Taerae -
Ricky - Valentino 
Gyuvin -
Gunwook - Diesel / Bottega Veneta 
Yujin - Ysl 

These are for luxury brands, I found it hard to do Matthew Taerae and gyuvin because they donâ€™t have a stand out personal style to me yet</p>
