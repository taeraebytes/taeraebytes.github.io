      <p>they can "buy" like on weibo. it's called "water injection". and if ur fanbase dedicated enough, they can like the comments more, it's counted for like a whole. it's often happened on c-idol from survival show to show their popularity competition.</p>

      <p>And the number of likes on weibo is not counted like on twitter, it is the total number of likes of the post and all the comments on that post...so sometimes you will see a post with a high number of likes but it is really because people are fighting in the comments section. Anw Hao is definitely the most popular 6th generation idol in China at the moment but this number is not impressive, the only thing worth noting is the fandom he can buying, which is important, kpop has really lost its hype in China</p>
