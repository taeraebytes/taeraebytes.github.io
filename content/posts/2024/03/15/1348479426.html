    "reply": "Yea I can admit that Ricky definitely got the short end of the stick yh abandoned him and he got lucky with the kfans and the mjx sitch wakeone I feel like just priorities the same 3-4 members so it's honestly just the fans I don't think they're ignoring him in that sense. But ugh can I just say smth and don't kill me ricky rlly does give off the vibes of a member that would do minimal socmed he was like that before and he's gonna be like that today. Socmed is his playground the lack of posts would essentially create more hype than being active especially when he isn't active in schedules. It wouldn't change much if he was more active it would just shake off his casuals and concentrate his fans but if he posts less goes live less it's like people are rationing food he's gonna go wayyyy more viral, I call this the BLACKPINK method."
