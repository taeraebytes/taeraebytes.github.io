      <p>gunwook is not buff he just has a wider bone structure. like ppl mistake him for being huge (muscular) or fat but he‚Äôs skinny to average for a man he‚Äôs just ‚Äúbig boned‚Äù (which is abt bone structure not the size of the bone most ppl who call themselves big boned to feel better r just fat and in denial). also most of his muscle mass is in his legs since he‚Äôs a dancer but like its not more than the average teen guy i feel like</p>

      <p>Like the only one who‚Äôs buff is matthew and sort of jiwoong but only after a pump bc he doesn‚Äôt even look alll that buff normally. But also i try to avoid looking at jiwoong for a prolonged period of time so maybe he is buff and I don‚Äôt notice. Everyone else built like a twink damn why is matty the only real namja</p>
