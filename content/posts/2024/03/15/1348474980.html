      <p>Btw requeefuen and fashion anon what do you think of the whole woongsungz magazine issue? I thought it was ridiculous that people were blaming Wakeone for this but then again idk how this all works, also what do you think is the current relation between Wakeone and Gucci</p>

      <p>I got asked ab it earlier and I'm just not surprised like the publisher still wants money they're probably mad af they got them on this edition and it might get fucked over but of course these two particular groups of ppl know nothing ab logic. I'm assuming because they stated the PUBLISHER requested this it's arena what does wakeone have to do with that...?

      <p>Sorry fashion anon again - for the part with the relationship about Gucci, since hanbin was wearing 2 unreleased pieces and 1 pieces that had been released the same week to the airport and jiwoong was wearing things that he bought himself or had been worn before I think itâ€™s safe to say they have dropped him and are more set on working with hanbin. Idk if there are chill allins in this but cmiif hanbin has wore new season gucci before but none of it has been unreleased however his fit to the ancora event was unreleased too so the fact they are now dressing him in unreleased stuff is a good sign for him. 

Heavy on the airport outfit because this is where my observation comes in, hariboz wore Gucci to China but I think it was all released and they did also dress jun who was flying out to their event so they were probably dressing all the artist. My only reasoning for why they may carry on with only hanbin is because hariboz werenâ€™t wearing Gucci from China -> Japan ( I think hao wore the bag and shoes he wore from Korea -> China)  again if any of this is wrong please correct me. There was no real reason for them to dress hanbin in unreleased stuff just to travel to Japan afaik heâ€™s only been dressed at the airport by them for bigger event like Kcon LA, mcountdown in France and award season but not the more casual flights like when they went to London. 

Anons can make their own judgement but just look out for some things and it will be obvious who they want to move forward with:

1) getting invited to future events 
2) getting dressed by them (bonus points if itâ€™s unreleased stuff)
3) they sent jw + hb flower and cake for debut and comeback keep and eye out and see if they send anything for either Japan debut or kr comeback ( this is probably the biggest indicator)

Side note: I donâ€™t think the arena magazine will be dressed by Gucci I think it will be like all the other photoshoots zb1 has done where they wear a mix of designer</p>
