      <p>there actually is substance though which is why taegunv (their normal chemi, not a ship) is also really popular in south korea. kfans like how they're mutually supportive of each other and compliment each other but I think the reason why it blew up as a ship is because taerae refuses to engage in yaoi fanservice whereas gunwook tried it a few times with him (which is ironic if anything you'd think taerae not engaging with it at all would tank the ship but it made it blow up)</p>

      <p>matthew and gunwook fit the traditional yaoi standards more (bigger height difference, matthew being the sunshine smiley guy, the whole yaoi act they're doing the entire time talking about dating and kissing etc.) it's funny that it isn't taking off with kfans because if anything taerae not engaging in fan service with gunwook at all and them barely interacting would make you think kfans would not like them as a ship but turns out they love the whole eager younger guy vs tsundere older guy dynamic even more than traditional yaoi</p>
