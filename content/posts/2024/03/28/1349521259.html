The main reason why many western fans donâ€™t hype him as much as they do the others is because of his age. There are yujinâ€™s 20+ yo fan accs that are being harassed and called pedo for simply liking and supporting him. Older intrl fans are so worried about his age, whenever they compliment his looks or skills they have to clarify theyâ€™re not pedoðŸ˜­ and he gets the least cheers when they perform overseas for that reason too",
