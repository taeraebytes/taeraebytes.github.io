      <p>I was looking at Japan Kcon details because I was hoping to go and they have this new segment called m countdown stage ? Iâ€™m still not sure what it is. But Iâ€™m certain hanbin will be an MC now, I was thinking maybe jaehyun too since bnd are going but they usually do 1 Korean MC and then 1 MC from the country of the show so maybe a kep1er member since they are going on the same day ?</p>

      <p>but Krazy doesn't have ties with mnet. Plus hanbin already got an mc segment during last KCON they are probably going to give him another segment</p>

      <p>Hmm idk last year it made sense they didnâ€™t have the mca mc there because neither of their groups attended any of the kcons afaik. But in all honesty if bnd riize and zb1 attend kcons it would make sense for them to use their own mnet associated mc then ask someone else and while all three are still rookies they will most likely go to a couple of them.</p>

      <p>That's not true gidle attended kcon LA next year and miyeon wasn't mc. I don't think mcs should mc at every kcon just because there's mcs because they're obviously better options depending on the country but it's just who mnet chooses and they're obviously obsessed with hanbin as he's been mc in kcon France and the upcoming kcon HK so</p>

      <p>I honestly don't think he'll mc for kcon la it's like fully in English and there's members that are fluent and members that are more proficient. Considering the market the popularity is different too idk this is just in case if a zb1 member is one of the 2 main MCs

      <p>although yujins stagnated I think he's still above hanbin and folks were saying that Ricky might be equal to him too it's debatable the bars can be big but popularity is another thing

      <p>Hanbin in the top 3....don't make me laugh. Hao is of course top 1, the fandom's reputation and fandom's purchasing power match, Yujin is top 2, his fans are very loud, even louder than rosin but their purchasing power cannot match. Top 3 is Ricky, his fans have been increasing quite well lately, but no purchasing power. The rest are considered nothing. Don't assume that HaoBin cp bar is also considered a fan of Hanbin. Anw maybe hanbin and gyuvin could compete for top 4, if gyuvin didn't sell too much yaoi with yujin and ricky and then suddenly drop them then he could be in top 4 and don't think im body shamming but Hanbin's looks is not the type that cfans like, they like skinny bod and sculpture faces</p>

      <p>oh I didn't even read that part but it is true to an extent with an industry and fandom space as ED stricken as this one I wouldn't be surprised if this was like a thought for some fan spaces and I like to surf weibo that's #1 ammo for the antis there

      <p>That's their standard, I didn't create it. And are the beauty standards ever not toxic? I didn't even comment on his weight, I just said cfans like skinny people and they really do, have you ever seen the current Chinese male idols? Do you really think only kfans tell idols to lose weight... Lol when if kfans create burners on twitter to tell idols to lose weight, cfans will call the office to ask directly</p>
