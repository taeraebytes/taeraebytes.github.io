      <p>But Ricky himself said in the fansign he’s been hanging out a lot with hanbin and I think you can see the effort is there and they do seem to like eachother. I think they may not seem super close if you compare them to other friendships e.g yuehuaz but he’s known them way longer and if you compare them from debut era to now it’s obvious they are a lot closer</p>
