      <p>ok case closed if the top 3 in america is ricky matthew hao, and top 3 in korea is yujin hanbin hao, top 3 in japan is gunwook hao matthew, top 3 in china is yujin hao ricky (all listed not in any particular order because idk their exact popularity btw dont attack me for that shit) then wouldnâ€™t it be safe to say hao is most popular globally (in the main markets theyâ€™re targeting) since heâ€™s always in the top 3 regardless? ðŸ¤” even in sea, iâ€™m from sea and hao is most popular here followed by hanbin, yujin used to be 3rd but now idk anymore because the ones i see that is consistently popular in sea is still haobin, [WALL], then the others kinda vary</p>

      <p>China and japan are the biggest markets after korea and then it gets muddled after that since there isn't another country they're too big in I think it comes to close to figure out who's after hao ngl
