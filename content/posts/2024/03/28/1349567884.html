      <p>Funny you say that anon because today i just realized how much they love to overhype and exaggerate things, i saw them talking about hanbin going viral among knets on pann for that eating show he went on tgt with matthew, just for the virality in question to be a pann article with 15k views and 30 comments being from his fans, the gag is his ifans camp on these k-forums too which makes it even funnier how they use these things to shit on the other members and call them irrelevant, hanbin is the most popular in korea true but he isnt as half as relevant among knets as they make him out to be</p>
