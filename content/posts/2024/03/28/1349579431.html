      <p>I just checked the TikTok of that old school new school. Like 90% of the comments are about Matthew. 5% about gunwook. Then comments saying they don't know who hanbin and Yujin were since they look the same lmao that's crazy.

Matthew popping off</p>

      <p>They should leave hiphop to mattparkz. Hanbin Yujin and Gyuvin should do idk whatever they want but better to not dance together with mattparkz.

Funny thing about zb1's dance line is the four are def the dance line and the other 4 are the ones who's not good. While Hao is in the middle since he's too good to be bundled on the not good ones, but we haven't seen enough dancing for him to be in the dance line. All his tiktoks are basically either girly pops or just cute ones. Never a serious one lol</p>

      <p>if Ricky improved we could've had a middle line but hao excels at performing so he might be in his own box but yea
