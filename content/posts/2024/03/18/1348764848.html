      <p>Do you think Gunwook would want someone older and stable in a relationship or do you think he's a bit of a fun hoe depending on when he's born he's either a cap or sag venus I'm trying to guess</p>

      <p>I think he has a lean towards older girls but nothing like what his noona fans think probably 2000-2004 üò≠ but even then his first few relationships would probably on the younger side and maybe even a younger girl than him. But the state of his relationships? I don't think he would do anything too serious or stable and he's too much of a lover boy for just a fun hoe phase so a mix like a regular puppy love teen couple vibe honestly his ideal type is probably girl gyuvinü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
