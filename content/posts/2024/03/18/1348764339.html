      <p>Whenever we talk about gunwook friendships I mourn about the lack of maknae content we have..any combination of these 4 on live have been the funnest lives imo I don't like the fact that the group is always separated to begin with in their content but I wish they would separate them into better groups</p>

      <p>Me too ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ they always put gunwook in odd Trios the maknae live was the best so far but like a show or smth with the youngest 4 would be a hit and they all get alone and are super close with one another and or are good friends. Like we could rlly make this the littest clique ever
