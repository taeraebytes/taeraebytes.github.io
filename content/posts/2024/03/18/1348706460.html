      <p>i never got on the gyuricky train bc it felt like ppl kept trying to make it the 2nd haobin (when ppl were saying they were getting 'banned' even before gyuvin's scandal lmao) which is wild bc it just wasn't matching up at allllll but i also take ships too seriously and if i can't at least imagine them together (since i know most kpop ships would never actually get together in reality bc even outside of sexualities there's work and all that) then i'm not on board and i could never picture gyuricky hypothetically getting in a relationship or doing ~things~ therefore i couldn't ship ðŸ˜­ i do find it a bit sad that gyuricky sorta fell off tho like aw man</p>
