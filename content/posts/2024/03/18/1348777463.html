      <p>Tbh the intl boycott isn't going to do shit into fans don't buy nothing anyways and with all the exposure they got the cb is going to be a hit</p>

      <p>It isn't going to affect stuff like their charts I mean the scandal is already going to affect that but it's not like riize was strong in sales but they rely on social media exposure and viralism that's where intl fans come in but the cb is what in a month? I don't think they'll even hold up once that rolls around
