      <p>Do you think Gunwook would want someone older and stable in a relationship or do you think he's a bit of a fun hoe depending on when he's born he's either a cap or sag venus I'm trying to guess</p>

      <p>I think he has a lean towards older girls but nothing like what his noona fans think probably 2000-2004 😭 but even then his first few relationships would probably on the younger side and maybe even a younger girl than him. But the state of his relationships? I don't think he would do anything too serious or stable and he's too much of a lover boy for just a fun hoe phase so a mix like a regular puppy love teen couple vibe honestly his ideal type is probably girl gyuvin🤦‍♀️

      <p>I think that's more gyuvin gunwook is definitely the type to be hung up on a first love for awhile but he is srsly emotionally intelligent and just mature he'd get over it in a few yrs but also I get the feeling he hasn't had his first love yet. He probably takes that love shit serious as hellll the type to actually only say I love you when he means it
