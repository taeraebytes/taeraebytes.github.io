      <p>Omg let me express myself on this subject because I have to hide my feelings everyday as a seokryu..

-Maetwook is cute it's the best Matthew ship IMO but I still prefer them as a brother pair and I don't like the super small guy super tall guy ships 
-Maetbin is SOOO mid sorry to all my maetbinnists friends🙏 it's just so bland and boring as a ship it feels like a Harry styles song
-But at least it's cute unlike FUCK ASS mattwoong rehearsed shitty bl lines ass ship I'm so glad this era is over🙏
-Im really seeing the potential for maetael like it could be the best Matthew ship if they leaned into the yaoi 
-Gyubmaet and neulmaet are cute actually the thing is I can't take any ship with Gyuvin seriously because how would I read this with a straight face like especially a smut scene no way, Hao and Matthew don't know eo like that for now but the potential is here it could be cute</p>
