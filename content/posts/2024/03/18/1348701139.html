      <p>He's definitely not coming back after the scandals but no sm did not release the scandals because they might be out of the gps graces why would they do that on purposeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ unless in some fucked up way they wanted a strong core fandom instead

      <p>Normal ppl dgaf abt the scandals they never made it out of twt or Internet forums. Even seunghan scandals never reached kmedia like most of ts is just perpetuated by K-pop fans and internet trolls</p>

      <p>majority of the gp that ppl refer to is broader kpop fans or ppl who listen to kpop the so yea it definitely is going to affect them like I'm sorry there is just no way the issue reached nonfans the sm cleanup just calmed down the fans rlly
