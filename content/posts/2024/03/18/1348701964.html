      <p>Mee like that's why I don't read yaoi like just write a straight love story atp idk any gay couples irl with such a gendered dynamic they all fucking their clones 😭 
I see this with haobin too like sm fics write Hanbin to be ripped and masculine and Hao to be a bratty femme fatale like they both skinny and fem come on😭</p>
