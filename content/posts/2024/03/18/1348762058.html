      <p>the more haobin act this way the more i am convinced it is all fanservice. a few months ago i was sooo sure it was all real and was so into it. but they are just doing too much now, it got boring and fake real quick. even if there is or was something real the things they share are so obviously bait and people eat it up. i should move onto riize for some traditional yaoi that doesn't ruin the group for me</p>
