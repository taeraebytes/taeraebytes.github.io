      <p>Some tea on IVE yujin , she’s very bitter and always look pissed off..said this way back in Splatbin cc. Everytime IVE has a schedule overseas she’s always looking mad af while the other girls are smiling and greeting fans lol (like that one time she was sizing up saweetie). There was one dive who got casted as an extra for one mv and they were talking abt how disappointed they were that a member couldn’t hide her annoyance and didn’t look nice the whole time (I immediately knew it was Yujin)</p>
