      <p>Mee like that's why I don't read yaoi like just write a straight love story atp idk any gay couples irl with such a gendered dynamic they all fucking their clones 😭 
I see this with haobin too like sm fics write Hanbin to be ripped and masculine and Hao to be a bratty femme fatale like they both skinny and fem come on😭</p>

      <p>Most haobin fics hanbin is the top tho and sorry but it’s neulbin over here but on the kside there’s so many hanbin bottom fics. I will say aside from the yaoi some of these fics have a really good story line like i lost the link but i recently read this completed one on this post apocalyptic world and i was just thinking some of these writers are actually too good for rps twt because these world building and storyline developments are so good.</p>
