      <p>Not in a ship way but i really appreciate hanbin for saying he wants to get closer to Ricky and then actively doing it too like Ricky is more on the reserved side so just little things like asking him if he wanted to say hi on his bubble live or randomly meowing back when Ricky meows at him makes me like the duo ðŸ¥º</p>
