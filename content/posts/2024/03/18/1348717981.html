      <p>Some tea on IVE yujin , she’s very bitter and always look pissed off..said this way back in Splatbin cc. Everytime IVE has a schedule overseas she’s always looking mad af while the other girls are smiling and greeting fans lol (like that one time she was sizing up saweetie). There was one dive who got casted as an extra for one mv and they were talking abt how disappointed they were that a member couldn’t hide her annoyance and didn’t look nice the whole time (I immediately knew it was Yujin)</p>

      <p>You know that one plastic surgreon on tiktok who made a viral video about her had the nerve to go to IVE concert the other day, he was in front row with his scrubs and bc she made a 0.1 eye contact with him he made a caption like she wants more ps consultations, he;s so weird</p>

      <p>like seriously she's way more natural than u think, the only invasive thing she probably got is double eyelid surgery unless she wears eyelid tape. People saying how she got her whole face reconstructed like no????? she didn't even shave her jaw her mandible bone is still there and her nose always been like that. She just lost baby fat cause she was fckin 14 in produce + puberty changes the face like ur bones and features are growing in. She prob got some non invasive things done which i dont even consider as plastic surgery like botox to slim down the jawline and she did get lip fillers but thats it. Shes wayyyyy more natural than ppl think but ppl cant accept that.</p>

      <p>Yea it's just her eyes I believe she got her massatter botox done she's gotten lip filler and I think maybe filler her nose tip? But also she rlly just got prettier I was looking back at pictures of me when I was 14 and my nose is a lot taller and sharper than it used to be soooo maybe she hadn't touched her nose but she rlly is way more natural than ppl think the hate is soooo forced leave this Angel alone

      <p>mm i love wony but she got her eyes done + nose implant + lip & cheek filler + buccal fat removal + most likely some sort of jaw procedure. she was always gorgeous but her face genuinely looks fake and the changes aren’t achievable through puberty like most people think</p>
