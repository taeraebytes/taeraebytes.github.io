      <p>He's definitely not coming back after the scandals but no sm did not release the scandals because they might be out of the gps graces why would they do that on purposeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ unless in some fucked up way they wanted a strong core fandom instead

      <p>Normal ppl dgaf abt the scandals they never made it out of twt or Internet forums. Even seunghan scandals never reached kmedia like most of ts is just perpetuated by K-pop fans and internet trolls</p>

      <p>i saw the ss and the only ones following the acc were his gf who is from ny and ningnings model friend who also studied in ny so you can always refute and say itâ€™s their mutual friend from ny since his gf is already friends w some influencers and like no face no case but yeah theyâ€™re coming back w seventeen, newjeans, ive, and more so theyâ€™re probably not going to chart as high. and then their global fans are boycotting so the fandom wonâ€™t advertise, stream, buy, or hype the album so yeah their downfall is coming</p>
