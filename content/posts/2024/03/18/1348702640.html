      <p>Ok seeing as y'all have talked about rps/yaoi, I just have a quick complaint, since we actually have GH yaoi too and Gunwook is always the bot for that kind of yaoi.

Neulmaet was only popular during boys planet, now the only rps stories they had is when it's a 4some or 3some

Neulbin eh. They're always switching who's the top or bot

Neultael neul is always top. Idk why, it's probably because they feel neul is more dominant 

Neulrik they're only paired when it's a story where bin cheated on neul with rik lmao 

Neulvin only paired when it's about rk cheating on vin with bin or when it's a 4some

Not talking about the other two</p>
