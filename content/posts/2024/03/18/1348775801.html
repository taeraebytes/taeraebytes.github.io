      <p>Honestly I just hope zb1 have a really good Korean cb and reach more fans cause while we definitely have the strongest fanbase amongst 5th gen we're missing the casual hype that big companies group have (even if it's forced)</p>

      <p>Me too and I prefer a strong fandom they actually put in the work and growing it is the most ideal I think they'll have a good cb

      <p>They needa do something with the jiwoong sitch that's all I'm saying, either make him apologize or give proof that that fan was lying even though I believe her or do some public stunt to make the korean gp sympathize with him and like him again to the point they're willing to look past the scandal. Other option is their song is supperrrr good that even if the korean gp hate him the song is too good to ignore.</p>

      <p>No I'm so deadass the best move is to ignore it there is literally nothing they can say or do at this point that will gain sympathy or have people like him any statement regarding the issue will just reignite hate. They're at a point where jiwoong is just a joke and less of actual hate so better to just keep it pushing tbh any kind of rehash will fuck us over

      <p>Really? I guess... but I'll trust your take. I just don't want the trolls to fuck with the other members. I remember when the jiwoong scandal first happened trolls and haters kept bringing up other members scandal like Gunwooks sasaeng scandal, Hao's past, Gyuvin incel moments and Hanbin's past dancing 'controversy' and other stuff. 

Then at the height of the controversy there was an award show and fans were fighting in the stands because one yelled and you can even hear it on tv Jiwoong leave the group or something. Then for some reason he decided it was the best time to post a duo selfie on Bubble where he was getting shit on by Knets with Ricky and Ricky got dragged a bit and then the whole Hanbin and Jiwoong Gucci event and magazine sitch. It wasn't even trolls fighting at this point, it was sub fandoms fighting because they know if their bias interacts with Jiwoong they'll inevitably get dragged.</p>

      <p>Yea it's unfortunate they were trying to drag everyone else during the issue it was a terrible time I thought we were free from gunwooks scandal but they just had to ruin my lifeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it also did make ppl defend the others in turn well not gyuvin but I haven't see gunwook get qrts telling ppl trynna drag him to die I was like yayyyyyyy. But now at this point in time they use the statements from wakeone, dispatch and his bubble messages as jokes during the eunseok scandal they were using jiwoong to crack jokes and it was kind of funny and I don't think the members will get dragged how they did initially if he's paired up with members they'll definitely get a little flack but it's to be expected. Also I have to thank god jiwoong pretends gunwook doesn't exist yayyyyyyyyyy
