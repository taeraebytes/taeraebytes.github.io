      <p>the interview coming out today disproving this oh well! they're not the closest in the entire group but saying they don't match is just a subjective statement they always compliment each other and get along well enough I'm sorry but both of them have other members they have less chemistry with</p>

      <p>oh ok congrats their parents have a mutual friends and gunwook said I love you??,$;&&:):?; like what was he gonna say "nah keep it cool brodie ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­" and that's also subjective I don't think they compliment each other at all but of course they do with jiwoong in the group but after that taerae is the last for gunwook for taerae idk

      <p>I'm not even trynna be rude but I can tell u don't pay attention to gunwook because that's just not true ðŸ˜­ jiwoong is an obvious dead last character in his list but then it's taerae then a wall then hanbin and Ricky then another wall then the rest and I think Matthew or gyuvin who are the highest. I'm debating on whether Ricky is on hanbins tier kr not just because we don't get to see much but gunwook talks ab Ricky a lot and more than hanbin but we do know the type of relationship hanbin and gunwook have and gunwook adores him so just cuz I like riwook better I'm putting Ricky above actually ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† but taerae and gunwook are pretty distant and it's obvious ðŸ˜­ he's one of 3 members gunwook does not speak informally to and it's kind of obvious why hanbins included in that it adds to the adoration and respect aspect
