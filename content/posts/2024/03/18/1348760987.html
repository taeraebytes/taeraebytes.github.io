      <p>I mean this doesn't do anything besides fuck up the pc market if they wanted more revenue to come their way they'd print more haobin pcs so ppl would buy the albums more rather than bid ppl bid each pc for 100k like the money is staying with the sellers ðŸ˜­

      <p>No less pcs mean big spenders will spend more in the hopes of getting it and it will be sold way less</p>

      <p>Nah ppl try their luck with bidding the highest the rush to buy as many album dies out real quick because it's a game of chance and everyone knows haobin is less in stock
