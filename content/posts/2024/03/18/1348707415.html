      <p>Mee like that's why I don't read yaoi like just write a straight love story atp idk any gay couples irl with such a gendered dynamic they all fucking their clones 😭 
I see this with haobin too like sm fics write Hanbin to be ripped and masculine and Hao to be a bratty femme fatale like they both skinny and fem come on😭</p>

      <p>the fics themselves arent that bad   there is a big lean towards binneul but it's tolerable and there's enough switch stuff.  the korean girlies make up for the lack of neulbin
Rps twt and  the twitter aus though...😭😭😭   jesus christ i dont wanna be mean but some are so horrendous it's always just Hao omega fem little princess  i had to mute the word princess cause it was too much. 
And after seeing his reaction to getting called wife/mommy by fans  idk why ppl are so obsessed with it  when he lowkey doesnt seem to even like such terms ifnfndjdn</p>
