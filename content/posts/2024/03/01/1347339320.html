      <p>I like Hanbin y'all but I have a slight criticism don't jump me tmh is my fav zb1 song but his high note at the end is very unpleasant and clearly not his range and you can hear it even with the hybe level of insane vocal retouching in this album and it bothers me so much omg you could just take out that high note? Or make it lower?</p>

      <p>I don't know why they don't just get taerae to do the high notes like he's best equipped I get that hanbin has that poppy airy light voice which SHOULD sound good but can't pull it off correctly, taerae voice has strong ballad vibe which may not fit the song but I would rather hear someone able to hit the note</p>

      <p>They just need to lower the range tbh you're not supposed to hear someone struggling in a recorded edited album kfhdkdkm and they're pretty skilled vocally Kpop is just obsessed with super high songs q</p>

      <p>that im suho (? forgot the name lmao) guy gave in bloom and some other stuff so already worked with them multiple times, they should keep them since i feel like they've already got a signature Vibe (even in crush if u ignore the loud chorus bit there's a certain vibe idk how to describe it). they could work with full8loom since they did izone and wjsn, could work with their current sound but then give it a mystical edge and then uhhhhhhhh idk let's throw in monotree (i looked up their works just now and apparently they were on and i LMAO ok well let's keep it going)</p>

      <p>i feel like they have a signature sound already what they also need is for the producers to build a relationship with the group and assign parts and songs according to their voices instead of a middle man operation

      <p>production nerd here 

1.off topic but im suho used to be part of a duo that was actually renowned to have good music almost sweetune/monotree level recognition but the minute they stopped working with each other their music stopped sounding good ðŸ˜­  he was the iggy in iggy youngbae like danggggg

2.  full8loom has the most consistent run out of any producers in kpop all their songs sound really great.

3.  monotree is actually a production faction consisting of multiple teams and producers led by hwang hyun who was a former member of sweetune, their music really does vary depending on who they work with like ONF's material is amazing but thats cause they work with hh only and he rarely works with any other group nowadays. there's also innerchild but their works are more generic. you'd have to look into them individually.


4. i really hope they get to work with DINT again he's made really good music like sugarcoat natty and over me</p>
