rocks for brains... he can't take a photo of his members without allins victimizing him as "treated like wakeone's staff" now? he walked the photo wall with globalz and did majority of the press interviews and group photos together except for this one snippet interview we don't even know what this was for yet it could just be a short interview in their ze_pisode and he could've been interviewed solo for all we know??üíÄ they're never grateful for anything smh</p>
