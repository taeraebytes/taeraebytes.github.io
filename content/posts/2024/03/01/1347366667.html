      <p>She deleted the tweet? And blocking both who were fighting you all ready to hate everyone. I know you are not going to post because it will not make gunwook victim. Gunwook is not special or some top tier celebrity that everyone wants to bring him down?</p>

      <p>She deleted the tweet 20 or so minutes ago but she blocked gpds who weren't being malicious at all you can't group that with bullies now can you ü§î and I wish gunwook was as irrelevant as u guys say clearly he's not if he's the target of hate from ur peopledem for months now what
