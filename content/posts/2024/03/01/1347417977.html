rocks for brains... he can't take a photo of his members without allins victimizing him as "treated like wakeone's staff" now? he walked the photo wall with globalz and did majority of the press interviews and group photos together except for this one snippet interview we don't even know what this was for yet it could just be a short interview in their ze_pisode and he could've been interviewed solo for all we know??üíÄ they're never grateful for anything smh</p>

      <p>That's speculated but it's not unlikely and also who the interviewers choose to interview is up to solely them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>First incident being tfma when he didn't do the group introduction as the "leader" and only introduced himself for their very first  award speech, it was trending on wb lmaoooo so many other groups fans were shocked in the comments especially because they were rookies.

Second one being the ai cover thing and you already know what happened with that and how wakeone tried to do damage control cause it was so bad, thousands of comments from ty and bbh fans saying he should stop using ai covers to hide the fact he can't sing. the way the only time he ever trends on there is when people clock him.

His fans really should just keep it extremely cute idk.</p>
