 this is too much... can fans pls buy like normal people or at least give these remaining cds to fans that actually want it. its sad that these things happen because of photocards. kpop companies should do something about this, i know they wont but the goverment should step in. this is so much waste. 1cd for one person is enough. if you want another members pc trade with other fans, its not that difficult. there are fans that couldnt even buy a cd...</p>

      <p>oh it's sad but this is just what a post pandemic kpop looks like now for every group that's popular. Some companies have tried to curb this buy releasing platform versions or pc centered no photobook albums like victon but it's not getting around to other groups. Tbz did smth similar in 2022 with whisper but they didn't do it again so it looks like we're stuck with kpop albums in our oceans
