      <p>she is ricky sasaeng, her name is sosweetricky, she was scolded by ricky for something and maybe the other sasaengs also heard it because later they exposed her, she rebanded to sosweetshimkongz and followed them to london and asked the members to pay for her food, then got exposed again after London, then rebranded again and got exposed again after the Japan vacation</p>
