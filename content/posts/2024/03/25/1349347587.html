      <p>the top 3 is definitely solidified I still think gunwook is the most popular just based off of the fancon and him trending the most during promo but someone else might tell u different

      <p>You made me laugh ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Hao is the most popular one in Japan. Gunwook is not even the second most popular member ðŸ’€ No japanese hit tweets, the least amount of fans present at the fancon, not the loudest cheers and the list goes on... I get wanting your bias to be popular at least somewhere but at least donâ€™t lie about it</p>
