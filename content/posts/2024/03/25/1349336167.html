      <p>the way some members haven't posted on the twitter account for ages while others get so many posts is so annoying</p>

      <p>I rlly feel like a lot of ppl have convinced themselves the socmed posting is stricter than it is yes the managers post for them (how it is for like every group in existence) but I think it's obvious the members that post the most request to post on twitter and the ones who don't don't ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ twitter is a platform they barely use but the ones who post the most are the ones that are pretty active on their bubbles and use the mnet plus stuff
