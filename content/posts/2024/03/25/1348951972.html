 her singing has fallen off so much lately like it's mainly her new technique that's failing her but compare that to this clip from 2021

      <p>while weâ€™re talking about vocals i think back of your cc abt bang pd possibly having a complex about it like how he has a complex about noses like fhhdjd the vocal degradation that happens to hybe idols like yunjin like why chaewon sounds more pleasant to the ear than her isnâ€™t yunjin supposed to be their main vocal whoâ€™s trained in opera</p>

      <p>Yuppppp it's like his goal to make his idols regress in every way I saw buddies even complain that yujus vocal growth began to stagnate and regress after being acquired by hybe and the thing is yunjin wasn't even that good to begin with and she's somehow worse than her 17 yr old self after going to opera training then training and promoting under hybe
