      <p>thoughts on hao not getting to perform always in any of their fancons? i think it's a valid concern tbh, wk1 makes them perform boys planet songs in both kr and jp fancons but can't let him perform a 2-min song from their actual debut album?? basically acting like the song doesn't exist in their discography just because it's not a whole group singing it. not to mention it's credited under zb1 and not hao's name</p>

      <p>I'm not rlly pressed about it I feel like you have ur answer on why it isn't being performed it's obvious and I don't think it's affecting hao so it's whatever at least he got to perform his other song broadcasted like tbh y'all should move on from that cuz it's not happening
