      <p>Hanbin is obviously the best dancer in the group I do think Hao is the better performer maybe the best in the group</p>

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>being a professional dancer predebut literally doesnt mean you’d be the best dancer among the group i do think hanbin has more knowledge about the technicality of the dance but during actual performances he’s literally not miles better compared to others so its so funny when i see allindans saying “but he’s the only one who is a professional dancer” as if it changes a thing 😭</p>

      <p>again with the arbitrary titles because you can consider all 9 professional dancers it's what they do for work😭
