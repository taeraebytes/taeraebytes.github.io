      <p>I’ll say it over and over again if these rosin solos are going off promotion then hao is more on a new wakeonez than Gunwook, right now he’s #1 new wakeonez</p>

      <p>Anon even if he didn’t have a single job from cjenm ( which he does the biggest being his ost) if they didn’t want to promote him they would be declining everything yet he’s had the most solo work and jobs in general since January. So again using the argument that these members must be the new wakeonez because they have a couple jobs doesn’t hold up if your not going to add hao to that.</p>

      <p>again... i have nothing against any other member but whenever other fans try to compare what popular members get to what the less popular ones get it just doesnt hold as an argument sorry... like did you expect gyuvin to be more promoted? like you can ask for your fav to be promoted and you're entitled to it ofc but acting like the popular members dont have more demand doesnt make any sense. and like you said, they get promoted ok not even well enough considering how popular they are (not talking about jiwoong dgaf about him) so yeah obviously the less popular ones are gonna get less</p>

      <p>yea those 3 are the most popular in korea (also not their only market😭😭😭??) but that's doesn't mean the others aren't popular either? Regardless you can't expect ur group to grow if you don't try to promote the members in this case of zb1 ppl are genuinely getting NOTHING. Like popularity plays a part in volume but it's the fault of the company because more often than not they can decide who to send. And considering they promote Matthew they're aware of their international markets which other members are popular in ex: Ricky and gunwook those two don't get shit. Again literally stunting ur own group at their rookie stage is crazy this is not ab less or more😭 because there's capacity to grow immensely thru promos if given the chance
