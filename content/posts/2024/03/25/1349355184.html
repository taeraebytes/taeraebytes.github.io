      <p>Anon even if he didn‚Äôt have a single job from cjenm ( which he does the biggest being his ost) if they didn‚Äôt want to promote him they would be declining everything yet he‚Äôs had the most solo work and jobs in general since January. So again using the argument that these members must be the new wakeonez because they have a couple jobs doesn‚Äôt hold up if your not going to add hao to that.</p>

      <p>and those jobs being cause he's in demand üò≠üò≠üò≠ like i said idgaf about this wakeonez cause even to me it's silly as fuck but trying to act ike wakeone promotes hao the most is just so funnhyggyfy they're doing the bare minimum considering he's the center and most popular. yall are gonna need to be at least reasonable while arguing</p>

      <p>U guys say bare minimum but would u rather nothing like half of this group omlüò≠ the only ppl that get promoted somewhat ok are hanbin hao Matthew yujin and jiwoong and Matthew is an obvious bottom for this list

      <p>again... i have nothing against any other member but whenever other fans try to compare what popular members get to what the less popular ones get it just doesnt hold as an argument sorry... like did you expect gyuvin to be more promoted? like you can ask for your fav to be promoted and you're entitled to it ofc but acting like the popular members dont have more demand doesnt make any sense. and like you said, they get promoted ok not even well enough considering how popular they are (not talking about jiwoong dgaf about him) so yeah obviously the less popular ones are gonna get less</p>

      <p>yea those 3 are the most popular in korea (also not their only marketüò≠üò≠üò≠??) but that's doesn't mean the others aren't popular either? Regardless you can't expect ur group to grow if you don't try to promote the members in this case of zb1 ppl are genuinely getting NOTHING. Like popularity plays a part in volume but it's the fault of the company because more often than not they can decide who to send. And considering they promote Matthew they're aware of their international markets which other members are popular in ex: Ricky and gunwook those two don't get shit. Again literally stunting ur own group at their rookie stage is crazy this is not ab less or moreüò≠ because there's capacity to grow immensely thru promos if given the chance

      <p>ngl i feel like you and anon are talking about different things, anon is saying that while the whole group should get more promotions bc they are popular as a whole, the more popular members are inevitably going to get more stuff and it shouldn‚Äôt come off as surprising</p>
