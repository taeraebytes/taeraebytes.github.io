      <p>I’ll say it over and over again if these rosin solos are going off promotion then hao is more on a new wakeonez than Gunwook, right now he’s #1 new wakeonez</p>

      <p>Anon even if he didn’t have a single job from cjenm ( which he does the biggest being his ost) if they didn’t want to promote him they would be declining everything yet he’s had the most solo work and jobs in general since January. So again using the argument that these members must be the new wakeonez because they have a couple jobs doesn’t hold up if your not going to add hao to that.</p>
