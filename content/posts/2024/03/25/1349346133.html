      <p>I forced my other friends to watch the fancon besides the ones I streamed with and they said it changed their lives they're back to being zerosesssssss. Watching it made me realize that they've grown insanely and that ppl were srsly trying to convince us they're shit I'm looking at these other groups I did not realize zb1 are winning by miles in talent like wow nobody can shit on them but ussss we can't allow it

      <p>exactly its just a lack of well prepared content/cbs but tbh the music always hit , they’re effortlessly funny and charming and imho they’re the most “rookie” like rookie some of these members perform and sing live like its their lass</p>
