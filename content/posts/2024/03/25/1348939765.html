      <p>the sm stans rlly sold their souls for the highest level of brainwash JAEHYUN??????????? In range both of them are better sorry the thing is that u also have to consider the training and technique those two are rookies with the most basic training and can hold a candle jaehyun aint all that like Ive never pegged him as an ultra good vocalistðŸ˜­ like he coooo he can sing but the pedestal is crazy and haechan is SO GRATING TO THE EARS JESUSSSSSSSS
