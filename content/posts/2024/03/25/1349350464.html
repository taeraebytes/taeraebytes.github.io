      <p>Hanbin is obviously the best dancer in the group I do think Hao is the better performer maybe the best in the group</p>

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>maybe bc you are not a dancer but at least for me who pays attention to technique there is a clear difference between him vs others. even on idol dancing his technique is still better. 

then there's cases like with yujin and matthew on where i think they are pretty good dancer but imo hao is out dancing them bc zb1 choreography style favours zhang hao a lot bc they are more jazzy choreographies. matthew is really good on choreographies like nkotb but dances like in bloom and yura yura are not that flattering for him bc of his hip hop roots.</p>

      <p>I'm not but I have an interest and I have a few dancer friends obviously my opinion isn't gonna overwrite someone who is lolll I think he does have the best technique because he was a dancer before this but like u said there's songs that don't favor him so the others will do better cuz of the dance foundations that's why I think it can get arbitrary and subjective when it comes to the title and even if there's a difference I think more than one person can hold the main dancer title

      <p>I mean yes, but Hanbin is also the one learning and teaching the choreo to some of the members plus he's the one supervising their dance practice so that kinda gives him more credits to his main dancer title. And yeah at least imo Gunwook is another main dancer. But fans will always fight over the main dancer title even if there can be more than one... Lee Know vs Hyunjin fans, Hoshi vs Dino fans, Taeyong vs Ten fans, heck even Natty and Julie fans have been fighting lately over the main dancer title like 😭 kpop fans are not serious.</p>

      <p>I came from a fandom where there was two established main dancers so it's why it doesn't make sense to me lol but yea I feel like the ability to teach is a different story and definitely his dance experience comes into that

      <p>You are a deobi right? Maybe bc i used to be close with some akgaes but Juyeon and Changmin fans used to fight all the time over the title. Especially around 2021 when Juyeon got the studio choom and all the end of the year show collabs and dance breaks.</p>
