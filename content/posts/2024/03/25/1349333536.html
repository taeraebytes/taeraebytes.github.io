      <p>is fashion anon still around because im curious if brands only give out invitations if its a china event? wk1 posted photos of the invitations gucci wrote to hariboz for the shanghai event, the invitation loewe wrote to hao for their shanghai event, but why don't we have photos of gucci's invitations to woongsungz or loewe's invitations to yujin and hao for their korean events? is it just some chinese cultural thing to write invites</p>
