      <p>Talking about Ricky as if Gunwook has not done any Surgeries just because his face is fat that doesn't means he has not done any surgery lol.</p>

      <p>tone deaf dumb low iq weak drag and pathetic I could go on but discussing ps for a member who's been accused of every surgery vs a member who's known to have the least amt procedures + was not even the topic of discussion... mmh u rlly are just an airheaded moron I could have just said Ricky was a plastic surgery monster chin filler fiend but I didn't let's worry about his reinvestment in a Natalie clinic for the next 2 yrs rather than being dumb in my cc ugh I was already getting annoyed today but now I'm just irked good day beloved

      <p>HELPPP ???!?!?!??!?!?! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the way you can tell a rosin wrote this so you'll drag Ricky just because ppl aren't agreeing with them SKADJFALSJKDHFJKLASH and you can tell it's rosins because they always bring up weight. Notice how all previous cc's were hao vs ricky then when rosins were losing the argument they suddenly brought gunwook in and used the words that trigger you? I can't rosins are too funny</p>

      <p>I just find it so funny because rosins do this ALL the time ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Trust me I know how they run things I'm one of the rare loud gpds on twitter and I fight with them on a daily they always say the same thing to drag our wookie and when they start losing their battle they change their pfp/ bios to another member so we'll stop dragging Hao and drag whoever they change their pfp to.  I used to fall for it all the time but it's clear as DAYYY. Fuck these rosins.</p>
