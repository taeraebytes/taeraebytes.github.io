      <p>i know you used to be a deobi so iâ€™m curious about when tbz were at the peak of their popularity. the stealer was when i saw people talk about them the most but since i was never a stan i donâ€™t know about the charts or sales.</p>

      <p>The stealer was amazing to them but their peak was definitely thrill ride/Maverick the exposure the promotion the sales the charts it was all the highest they were breaking all their records. I truly believe the momentum would've kept going if it weren't for the IST merge I kid u not shit was already going downhill a week in they tried to capitalize off of them (SHARTBO) and use that "starve for content" model like they weren't a bg known for great content/fan interaction with a relatively newer fanbase (post rtk growth) and it was so sad cuz they just finished kingdom which literally traumatized them before all this ðŸ˜¢. Plus they toured all of 2022 so yea they were doomed it broke my heart they could've been smth legendary and they blame it on themselves a lot too
