      <p>I forced my other friends to watch the fancon besides the ones I streamed with and they said it changed their lives they're back to being zerosesssssss. Watching it made me realize that they've grown insanely and that ppl were srsly trying to convince us they're shit I'm looking at these other groups I did not realize zb1 are winning by miles in talent like wow nobody can shit on them but ussss we can't allow it

      <p>i’ve been saying people have been hating on them so unnecessarily and nitpicking them for absolutely no reason while not holding the same standards to other groups like people have personal vendettas against the group or the fandom and then project that on to their perception of the group instead of seeing zb1 just as they are. it’s so tiring tbh the hate they get is so unnecessary</p>
