i came across shbchart's tweet ab that sales ranking and got confused because i'm planning to buy from colorgram and last i remembered zb1's sales start on april 1st which is 2 days from now, so i looked at the qrts and sure enough there's ppl calling them outðŸ˜­ damn this is so embarrassing why is shbcharts claiming these sales have anything to do with hanbin</p>
