      <p>It's pretty obvious haobin are the biggest Kpop cp fandom ever, I don't think any other Kpop ships can even be classified as a cp. The interesting thing is, they also trend (their ship name) pretty constantly on instiz too, considering this is an unique situation, I'm not sure how I would have gone by promoting them either. I think the balance right now is right</p>
