      <p>Theyve been setting him up badly, when the whole anton eunseok was going down there were actually a lot of opinions that seunghan wasnt that bad after all, but seunghan kfans got caught shading members, some of them mentioning them directly on weverse to not engage with ot6 content and then we all know intl briizes mass spamming him, then seunghan showing up was like the final cherry on top that ppl just dont want him back even some previous korean ot7 briize</p>
