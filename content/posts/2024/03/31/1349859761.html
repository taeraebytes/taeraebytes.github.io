      <p>I'm not sure if I can state that I don't want to share a Twitter link here only to incite further outrage. But do you think there is anything going on between Yujin and Hao? I know it's kind of forbidden, but some people have extremely strange speculations, and a few of them felt enraged when Hao put his hand on Yujin's waist.</p>
