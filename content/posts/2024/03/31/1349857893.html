      <p>Sister not with that orange hair. I'm sorry requeefiem I love you but Ricky looks Ursula from Little mermaid with that orange hair and long chin. Frankly speaking he needs to put some weight.</p>

      <p>Before the Jiwoong scandal Jiwoong and Yujin were the universally agreed upon visuals in kforums, Ricky and Gyuvin were sometimes put in there without much backlash, haobin were occasionally out in there but would get backlash as they have a lot of haters in those sites

Thus wether you like them or not Jiwoong Yujin Ricky and Gyuvin are the most uncontroversial visuals</p>

      <p>Wonbin is like Karina more hit or miss visual but stronger stage presence (Karina also has a crazy body though)
Sungchan is a classic beauty like winter but weaker stage presence</p>
