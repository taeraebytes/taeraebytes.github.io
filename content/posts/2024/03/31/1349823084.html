      <p>Sorry I keep on seeing Allins saying hanbin is mistreated by Wakeone. May I ask on what was the mistreatment about? I'm probably out of loop since I got inactive. What did Wakeone do?</p>

      <p>Unbiased opinion. For anon, i guess you should ask an allin about this. They are the only one who can answer you truthfully. Im not even an allin but I kinda understand them and I do get their point. Though Hanbin its not the most mistreated one, but the rant from them is kinda understandable bcs I notices that too. Except for some ofc, but still you know. You will find out if you get the answer from the fans itself. I hope requee show this.

Anyway, for you op. I found out that we have same bias in bts, The Golden MaknaeðŸ’œ I didn't know you are an armyðŸ˜…</p>
