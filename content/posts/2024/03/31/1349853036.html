wow no one can convince me shbg isn't made up of akgaes who hate zh lol the hashtags are for haobin but the photo they used makes it look like hanbin is the only one mcing with that tiny haobin photo in the corner...ðŸ˜€ while zhg kept it professional and used a proper duo photo for the haobin mc tags

not to mention shbg is trending a solo phrase for mc hanbin only (kcon with mc shb) while zhg's solo phrase isn't mc related (heart stealer zh)... 
full shade but if they're going to run a fanbase they should keep it classy like zhg</p>

      <p>They trended the mc duo tag and a solo tag line ? Imo it didnâ€™t seem that shady zhg was in their right to make a solo mc tagline too it just depends on what they wanted to do. Because saying mc hanbin isnâ€™t technically wrong and the duo tags says mc hao and hanbin no ?</p>
