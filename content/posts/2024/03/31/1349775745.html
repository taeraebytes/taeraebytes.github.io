i came across shbchart's tweet ab that sales ranking and got confused because i'm planning to buy from colorgram and last i remembered zb1's sales start on april 1st which is 2 days from now, so i looked at the qrts and sure enough there's ppl calling them outðŸ˜­ damn this is so embarrassing why is shbcharts claiming these sales have anything to do with hanbin</p>

      <p>he's endorsing an existing line so if they are using it to compare sales with other members it's not correct but if they are doing it to show his sales while the product wasn't in the top before, i don't find anything wrong with it lol.</p>
