      <p>It's also because this is from the global membership and not everyone has access to view it I think? Unlike the previous ones but yes, he gets away with everything</p>

      <p>the incel slang was on mnet plus which is the same function so anyone could see this since it's been uploaded to twt but he's pretty much lost his fanbase that would care and only has troll fans ðŸ˜­

      <p>No I mean the incel one is from mnet plus but everyone is able to see it. But you need the global membership to see his comments now since he uses the new function. This is only seen by the one who joined the membership</p>
