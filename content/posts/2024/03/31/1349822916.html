      <p>Sorry I keep on seeing Allins saying hanbin is mistreated by Wakeone. May I ask on what was the mistreatment about? I'm probably out of loop since I got inactive. What did Wakeone do?</p>

      <p>Unbiased opinion. For anon, i guess you should ask an allin about this. They are the only one who can answer you truthfully. Im not even an allin but I kinda understand them and I do get their point. Though Hanbin its not the most mistreated one, but the rant from them is kinda understandable bcs I notices that too. Except for some ofc, but still you know. You will find out if you get the answer from the fans itself. I hope requee show this.

Anyway, for you op. I found out that we have same bias in bts, The Golden MaknaeðŸ’œ I didn't know you are an armyðŸ˜…</p>

      <p>Saying he's mistreated will frankly just make the word mistreatment not look good on him since he's basically the one along with Hao and Matthew who got jobs. 

His jobs (per Allins) are not getting promoted but he's frankly the only ones who even got jobs rn along with the other 2 so the other 6 member fans can't even experience the mistreatment y'all are saying.

If he's mistreated, I would love my bias to get the same type of mistreatment as him then. Esp mca mc</p>
