      <p>Sorry I keep on seeing Allins saying hanbin is mistreated by Wakeone. May I ask on what was the mistreatment about? I'm probably out of loop since I got inactive. What did Wakeone do?</p>

      <p>I think he had like a short segment during one of the vlogs? But it wasn't focused on his mc moment or anything. While Wonyoung and Daniel had a full vlog I think that's why they were complaining</p>
