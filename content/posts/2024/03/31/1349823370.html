      <p>right ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but I think they're speaking in korean and since it's hk maybe hao and Ricky have never been? But still they should've been doing the tour it's kinda weird but we'll see if there's a reason for the concept

      <p>If itâ€™s for their own yt channel it will definitely be in Korean, also just because they are Chinese itâ€™s entirely posited have never been to HK. Iâ€™m from HK and Iâ€™ve never travelled to mainland China.</p>
