      <p>Hanbin got posted on the official gucci ig story and don't think any creative director was present at the Korean event but he and the general manager of gucci posed together in one picture, also 8-10 fashion magazines present on the event posted about him, imo also highlighted him among most of the other high profile guests. Also imo as a rookie from a weak ass company he was treated quite nicely.</p>

      <p>He is the head of Gucci Korea, he was the head of Gucci China and Gucci Russia before and is now head of Gucci Korea which was a huge promotion considering Koreas not the worlds largest consumer of luxury goods per capita.</p>

      <p>this man has been places cause i read that while he was working for gucci china he made their revenue go up by 200% i also read that america is guccis biggest market (36%) followed by canada (8%) then south korea (6%) which kinda shocked me cause i wouldve thought that china would be higher than skorea on the list.</p>

      <p>That's surprising but I think that might be because they Gucci doesn't have a presence in the Chinese fashion world?

      <p>Different anon but this man’s LinkedIn is still public and yeah if he liked hanbin then hanbin’s really getting the bag here because I only saw him take pics with 2 other people  in the whole event (1 being soeun from singles inferno) but he has no public social media and the photos were never posted anywhere ( aside from the behinds the scenes of them on a media account) so he probably asked for them for personal keeping? Otherwise they probably would have been posted. 
This is from his linkedin- “I have a successful track record of developing subsidiaries around the world, including Digital and Retail development (DOS and franchisee network, transition wholesale to retail). During my professional journey, I managed businesses in several countries, among which are Russia, South Korea, Emirates and China (where I led the Gucci expansion to a 200% revenue increase).” So he increased Guccis expansion in China by 200%.
His job history is quite extensive too he’s worked as-

General manager for Cartier in Greece and Cyprus 

COO of richemont dubai 

Managing director of Hugo Boss Russia 

General manager at Gucci Russia -> China -> now South Korea 

Maybe fashion anon can give more insight but I’m assuming he’s the one choosing who the brand sponsors and works with in Korea ?</p>

      <p>Is he looking for a young bride? I would assume his position is too high to be picking the sponsors himself especially considering that sponsorships are lower than ambassadorships

      <p>Fashion anon back but contrary to popular belief these higher up do have say in things like sponsorships ect. Although who is working with a brand in any capacity is usually discussed with a board of people rather than just 1 person saying oh I like them we’re going to sponsor them. In my own experience what tends to happen is marketing directors and heads of public communications keep an eye out for people on the rise that allign with their brand image and value and are well liked and relatively scandal free ( more leniency is they are super famous) at meetings with higher ups and the final decision tends to lie with whoever is the head. Although this varies by level of involvement so for Gucci simply sponsoring him or (hypothetically) if they made him a house ambassador that would lie with the general manager or Korea because that falls within his scope of responsibility. Things like brand ambassadors though are usually scouted way higher up though but still follow the same sort of rule. So the general manager of any country or for BA the creative director might say we have X or I know or X who is up and rising and think they are a really good match what do you think? The final decision lies with those at the top of the food chain because it’s all business at the end of the day, but like anon said if this guy is the general manager or South Korea and he’s choosing to sponsor him and you see progression in that business relationship I’d see it as a good sign especially for someone so new in the industry. DISCLAIMER I didn’t intern at Gucci so take what I saw with a grain of salt because it might not be exactly how that happens there but I did intern at another luxury fashion house and this is based of what I knew they did and what some other fashion house did.</p>
