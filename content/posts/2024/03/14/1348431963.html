      <p>Btw requeefuen and fashion anon what do you think of the whole woongsungz magazine issue? I thought it was ridiculous that people were blaming Wakeone for this but then again idk how this all works, also what do you think is the current relation between Wakeone and Gucci</p>

      <p>I got asked ab it earlier and I'm just not surprised like the publisher still wants money they're probably mad af they got them on this edition and it might get fucked over but of course these two particular groups of ppl know nothing ab logic. I'm assuming because they stated the PUBLISHER requested this it's arena what does wakeone have to do with that...?
