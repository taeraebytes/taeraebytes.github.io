      <p>Idk if itâ€™s for the cb they havenâ€™t released the date yet. All we know is they are going because hanbin asked jaejae to invite them and they said they would to repay him for doing the challenges with her. But thereâ€™s no actual news on when itâ€™s going to happen.</p>

      <p>Usually jaejae does very in-depth research on the idols and their editing is really good so the EP will do well either way, I'm confused by that group though? But I guess they're the variety kings</p>

      <p>Gunwook just need to filter his words, being too trendy is not it and stop lurking on k-sites like there are so many hannam slang in there, we don't want another gyuvin situation</p>

      <p>I don't even rlly think on broadcasts he's has issues his wit has gotten him far (referenced on snl korea) it's just that people already decided they don't like him he's never rlly crossed lines verbally or used hannam slang but his reputation is a lot better now than it was before so there's hope
