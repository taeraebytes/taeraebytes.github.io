      <p>I feel like other than hanbin, gunwook is the only member who could be a good MC. Jiwoong, gyuvin, and ricky would be awful, Hao would be good but he doesnt seem interested maybe cuz introvert, yujin too awkward, matthew is decent but something is off, taerae seems too lazy</p>

      <p>Hanbin and wook totally
Jiwoong Ricky taerae don't seem interested
Hao did well in the mcountdown special thingy but he seems moody
Matt did well but he gets a bit nervous in btw
Gyuvin might do well but start stuttering when he sees someone he likes
