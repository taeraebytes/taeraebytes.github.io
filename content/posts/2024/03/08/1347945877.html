      <p>I heard Japan is really strict about fan support aswell like in terms of what you can bring into the arena it’s so strict so the no solo fan support doesn’t suprise me. I went to Japan for the Kepler concert and I don’t think I saw any solo fan support around the actual venue but people do it further out like at stations and such</p>
