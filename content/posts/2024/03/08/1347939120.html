      <p>they are making up rumors about how gunwook and now hanbin probably have signed up with wakeone after zb1 just cause hanbin went to that gucci event💀. did they forget that hao and yujin went to a loewe event one week ago? then hao also went to the cjnm movie screening... like 😂😂 their takes are getting funny and funnier</p>
