      <p>Usually jaejae does very in-depth research on the idols and their editing is really good so the EP will do well either way, I'm confused by that group though? But I guess they're the variety kings</p>

      <p>Because he got the perfect korean jokes like if johnny is the one with his stantwt jokes, jungwoo is the one who suits korean more that sometimes intl fans didn't understand his jokes because he's witty and good with words, haechan has it too but kfans hate his ass. Matthew is more like johnny in this case</p>
