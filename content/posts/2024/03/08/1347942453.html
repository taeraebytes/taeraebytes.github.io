      <p>they are making up rumors about how gunwook and now hanbin probably have signed up with wakeone after zb1 just cause hanbin went to that gucci event💀. did they forget that hao and yujin went to a loewe event one week ago? then hao also went to the cjnm movie screening... like 😂😂 their takes are getting funny and funnier</p>

      <p>Everyone hated crush. I even knew it was shit already when Hao said crush .. is not bad lmao. He can't even say it's shit when he wanted to. Like he advertised the hell out of in bloom but didn't even say anything about crush.</p>
