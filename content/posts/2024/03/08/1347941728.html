      <p>This is crazy. Will hanbin fans even buy that if it has Jiwoong in it? Imagine if it's a duo cover and not a solo cover?

So it's hanbin Jiwoong , Hao Yujin</p>

      <p>theyre talking about boycotting it on instiz but at the same time theyre worried it may affect the group because what if the pictorial no longer wants to work with them in future projects because of the boycott. seems like they just want jiwoong out and boycotting is the only way to show wakeone their stance but theyre worried because its gonna harm the group.

i say boycott fuck it u can always earn pictorial trust back because they know the reason for the fans boycott</p>

      <p>Lmao it's the magazines fault if the sales are low btw. They should know what the kfans think if they know what's happening ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like anyone else is better than jiwoong at the present.</p>
