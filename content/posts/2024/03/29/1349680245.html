      <p>good luck dealing/fighting off rosins when gunwook gets as many or more screentime/lines than hao or when they try to spread rumors or pull up the most random stuff to make other fandoms hate him. i know that i dont want that for gunwook. #prayforrequeefiem #gunwookplsredebutasasoloist</p>

      <p>i am #gunwooksoloistteam because i know that there is almost no chance of him redebuting with the other zb1 members. i dont want to see him in a group with strangers that could ruin his or the potential groups career. the only way im fine with him being in a group is, if he gets picked up by a big company. those big companies protect the shit out if their artists (as they should)</p>

      <p>oh rlly? idk i was kind of excited to see a group created around gunwook if jellyfish was planning a new bg but theyre not and theyre shit idk what the future holds but its unlikely hell debut with complete strangers I think at this point its just known that survival shwo group members need to debut with one another for a little success but a solo career would be so interesting but id be so scaredüò≠
