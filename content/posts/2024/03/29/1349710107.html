      <p>they literally have critically laid out points as to why a certain vocalist is above the other etc AND they have hundreds of people who vocally train in their comments to dispute them if they're wrong (there's none to dispute cuz they're right) so if You (the anon not u requifiem) can give us any actual reason why any of the things said in the analyses are wrong then go ahead</p>

      <p>anon probably only watched the bp rankings which was like a year ago but a lot has changed with their rankings now that they have more materials to base their analysis on. hanbin is now weak to average along with gunwook and matthew while jay is still under reevaluation but is predicted to be weak to average too you can see it in their community tab if u dont want to watch the vid!</p>
