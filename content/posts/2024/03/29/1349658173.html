      <p>allindans love to say hanbin is a main vocal but i literally never see them compare him to other 5th gen main vocalists or get into arguments with other fandoms about it and they know why lmfao... all this 5th gen vocalists discourse on twitter and zeroses being annoying as hell trying to push the "vocalbaseone" agenda is so corny brah</p>
