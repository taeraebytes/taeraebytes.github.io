      <p>I am so surprised even Nct Chenle voted for Hanbin oh my god that guy really got the whole nation voting for him. bnd Jaehyun ace members and many more I can't even list it down. He is basically nation's one pick. I never saw a trainee being that loved after Kang daniel.</p>

      <p>Ok I wouldn’t usually defend but some of you guys (anons) are really doing to much like this is just nitpicking atp. If you actually go back and watch the video gv says “shall we ask the person feeding the birds for some food” and then hb says he will go and ask her and then gets food for all the bots to feed the birds. The same way gw said they made him go ask the high school girls if they could film on the basketball court. Like this is just giving older sibling energy if anything and there really isn’t anything weird about that situation at all😭</p>
