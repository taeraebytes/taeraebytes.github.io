      <p>im gonna get my riyangi card revoked over stating this but riyangis esp intl side needs to stop delude themselves into thinking that w1 putting ban on his bbl/sns or something 😒😒like okay it made sense when the bbl live incident happened but its been five (FIVE!!!) months, even before they launched bbl ricky is pretty unactive too compared to another member. he caught the blackpink disease me think (releasing few uploads at short time and went into hibernation for a century)</p>

      <p>they're genuinely deluding themselves like I'm sorry that boy is not being restricted this happened in October 😭 and I think it's valid to be upset like what's the point of paying $4 a month for sparse messages like I get the point of him sending authentic messages but a heyyy how are u here and then will do🤦‍♀️
