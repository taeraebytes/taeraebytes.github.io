      <p>The thing about zb1 why they have a lot of solos and askaes fans is because we don't have a chance to know more about them. All of their contents basically doesn't help. I hope wakeone learn from bts run or nct life. Like, atleast gives us some episodes where they are just playing and interacting to eo freely. In all of their contents, they are just following scripts or what they have been told to. This is why, their views is low bcs people wants something interesting not the repetitive and controlled interaction. Gyuvin's vlog is the best thing that happens. I just hope everyone was there.</p>

      <p>eh? idk the pos to a survival show group is that you know them before they debut unlike a company group you have to get to know first before you blindly stan. The issue here is that just like any survival show group the fandoms were strong on their own and they weren't harnessed tgthr immediately

      <p>eh idk i think ot9 content since the beginning would've help but tbh at this point hanbin could tell the most tearjerker story about him being idk beat up or sumn and c-rosins would still say "deserve"</p>

      <p>Oh no it would've helped that's what I mean by harnessing the fandom but it's not that the fans didn't know them they did
