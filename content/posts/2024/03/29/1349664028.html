I'm in a group full of sasaengs from other groups and they're there to exchange surface information. The information they exchange the most is whether that group often goes to the gym or not, and it's not because they can access idols when idols go to the gym, but they feel that idols who don't go to the gym are \"letting themselves go\" and not worthy to stan. I remember Lesserafim gets praised for going to the gym a lot and they criticize groups that don't go to the gym, it's crazy",
