      <p>they literally have critically laid out points as to why a certain vocalist is above the other etc AND they have hundreds of people who vocally train in their comments to dispute them if they're wrong (there's none to dispute cuz they're right) so if You (the anon not u requifiem) can give us any actual reason why any of the things said in the analyses are wrong then go ahead</p>
