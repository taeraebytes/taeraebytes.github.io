      <p>i wouldnt say he annyoed matthew when they were doing the ily game (on the japanese show), but you can tell there was a way different dynamic between them compared to from boysplanet-inbloom where matthew was like all over him and they used to stick to each other for everything, i mean its natural to make newer connectios-  jiwoong in general isnt given the same type of respect (not in a wierd hierachy way but looking up to kind of way) within the group anymore i just dont think he can connect with any members</p>
