      <p>But Ricky himself said in the fansign he’s been hanging out a lot with hanbin and I think you can see the effort is there and they do seem to like eachother. I think they may not seem super close if you compare them to other friendships e.g yuehuaz but he’s known them way longer and if you compare them from debut era to now it’s obvious they are a lot closer</p>

      <p>diff anon but have yall not read about mbtis? maybe im too naive because i always fall for those gossip magazines horoscopes and my dentist always has a bunch laying around so everytime i go i go ham on them. nyways i think there's some truth to mbtis i mean its big for a reason right? ever since his mbti came out cuz i dunno much about him it kinda makes sense like his mbti is known to be a serial introvert just google it

'INTPs prefer spending time alone for the most part. Unlike extroverts, who gain energy from interacting with a wide group of people, introverts must expend energy in social situations. After being around a lot of people, INTPs might feel like they need to be by themselves to recharge and find balance.'

i dont think its anything deep tbh like he spends all day with the guys practicing and doing schedules and u can clearly see in the bts vids hes always joking and playing around because theyre obv friends, like u can tell when someone is just there because they have to be there cough cough oh and also dont forget about the amount of staff constantly around them too who he probably has to interact with so imo he just needs to be alone for his own sanity when he gets a chance aka staying home or in their hotel instead of going out and his mbti type really reallyyy likes being alone.</p>
