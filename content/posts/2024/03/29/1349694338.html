      <p>I am so surprised even Nct Chenle voted for Hanbin oh my god that guy really got the whole nation voting for him. bnd Jaehyun ace members and many more I can't even list it down. He is basically nation's one pick. I never saw a trainee being that loved after Kang daniel.</p>

      <p>He talks a lot of nonsense and is talentless as hell but acts like he is so talented. Dream have to be the group with no self awareness at all. Sm's worst group talentwise who thrive only on yaoi.</p>

      <p>Sorry but haechan is the only vocalist in dream and he is at jiwoong's level. Forget about chenle and renjun, they arent even vocalists, just singers.</p>
