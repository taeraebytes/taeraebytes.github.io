      <p>Wait this reminds me of that punch thing tho they did on ZBTV I think it was Gunwook first and then Hanbin ? Maybe he has hidden strength? Heâ€™d probably have a lot of arm strength from whacking anyway.</p>

      <p>Different anon but I went back and watched 

Jw- 842
Zh -793
Hb- 855
Mt- 799
Tr -831
Rk -839
Gv -871
Gw -863
Yj -763

So he was 3rd but yeah in comparison to members who have more obvious muscle he might just have a sleepers build ( idk if that what they call it) because he obviously must have developed a lot of arm strength from whacking like anon said also this reminded me of that bp fanmeet thing they did and he was able to carry phanbin and kamden on his back easily so he probably just doesnâ€™t have a lot of visible muscle but a lot of strength.</p>
