      <p>Wait this reminds me of that punch thing tho they did on ZBTV I think it was Gunwook first and then Hanbin ? Maybe he has hidden strength? Heâ€™d probably have a lot of arm strength from whacking anyway.</p>

      <p>he said that he works out more on his chest so i guess that he has more strength on his upper body, although his legs are nice he has dancer legs.</p>
