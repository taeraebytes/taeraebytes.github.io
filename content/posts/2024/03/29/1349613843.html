      <p>The way that he ignored Sohee and just asked Myungjae who seems sloppy as hell and Hanbin who posted with a volleyball ball as if it was a basketball one. And the worst part is that the two of them lied to his ass and told him that they did play basketball ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Those idols are hungry for some friends omg.</p>
