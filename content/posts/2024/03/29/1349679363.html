      <p>good luck dealing/fighting off rosins when gunwook gets as many or more screentime/lines than hao or when they try to spread rumors or pull up the most random stuff to make other fandoms hate him. i know that i dont want that for gunwook. #prayforrequeefiem #gunwookplsredebutasasoloist</p>
