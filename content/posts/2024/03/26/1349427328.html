Like for example his arm details are always on point and he always extends and finishes a move. He used to teach classes too so obviously he had to have reached a certain level of it. He only moved fully into hip hop focused dances in his late teen and early 20s so he’s still building. I will say though he seems to have loosened up more now than at debut I think he’s settling into idol dance a bit better than before.",

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>being a professional dancer predebut literally doesnt mean you’d be the best dancer among the group i do think hanbin has more knowledge about the technicality of the dance but during actual performances he’s literally not miles better compared to others so its so funny when i see allindans saying “but he’s the only one who is a professional dancer” as if it changes a thing 😭</p>

      <p>again with the arbitrary titles because you can consider all 9 professional dancers it's what they do for work😭

      <p>that's not how it works sis... the good dancers in the group will never be at hanbin's level even if they dance for kpop for years they won't be professionals unless they enroll in an academy and take LESSONS for that...</p>

      <p>Ok I don't have time to argue with you the good dancers in the group have half the amt of yrs hanbin has. a professional dancer is an arbitrary title and not to mention every member is considered one bcuz they do it for work andddddd ok that's it case closed don't be dumb

      <p>ok and hanbin was taking tutting and whaacking lessons anon he isn't all-rounded when it comes to dancing like he really isnt all thattffghffhgng put him next to someone who is specialized in another dance genre and he'd get cleared 🤷‍♀️ plus he's literally a kpop idol who cares about "professional dancing" ?like yeah he's a great dancer but i've never seen a fandom overestimate someone's skill this much sometimes it feels like a set up</p>

      <p>Like comparing dancing can get so arbitrary there was this exact convo not long ago ab comparing other idols to zb1 and it just comes down to technique and specialization like the insecurities are getting so annoying it's ok to say the other dance members are just as good as hanbin they all excel at different things..

      <p>He has but I feel like you can tell esp with hip hop they're harder for him cuz it contrasts his specialization. Tutting and ballroom are within this realm so he's probably super good at them and obviously much better at it then any dance idol but for hip hop he's bested within zb1 their choreos sometimes tap into hanbins specialization they remind me of izone but others have other roots that someone else could be better at which is expected they all have different backgrounds
