      <p>no bc idgaf if you are an akgae but the way some of them come here and say that zb1 is mediocre, that their perfomances/choreos are bad and that the members are boring and this and that but then they turn around and be fans of 5th gen idols with people who can't sing at all. some of those akgaes got me thinking riize were the most prominent dancing group and that zb1 members could never keep up with their choreo, then i watched their perfomances just to find out that the only ones keeping up with their own choreo are wonbin, sohee and stotaro like don't make me laugh.</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the shotaro glazing has rlly taken things too far hes just in his element (hip hop) everyone acts like he's untouchable my goodness... and I thought so too but zb1 are miles better at performing and actually sing live their dance lines and vocal lines are more solid too like zont play w the kings

      <p>i am og anon and tbh it was crazy, those girlies had me thinking we had itzy dancing skills in bg version with harder choreos, and then i looked up and only shotaro got me impressed, those girlies were yapping and yapping about how zb1 could never be RIIZE members bc they were so above in dancing while half of the group is struggling with their own choreo like get out of my face. For TWS I was expecting some gaggery while listening to their music and those songs sound as mid as Plave songs. Was expecting some visual kings too and then the only good looking one is that Shinyu dude. 

At least BND fans can brag about how all the members are good dancers and at least they have the member who looks like a Sunghoon clone, and yet they are the ones who never trash about ZB1, they still can't sing unlike our jebes tho.

And for plave... I have no words.</p>
