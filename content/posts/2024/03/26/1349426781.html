      <p>Hanbin is obviously the best dancer in the group I do think Hao is the better performer maybe the best in the group</p>

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>being a professional dancer predebut literally doesnt mean you’d be the best dancer among the group i do think hanbin has more knowledge about the technicality of the dance but during actual performances he’s literally not miles better compared to others so its so funny when i see allindans saying “but he’s the only one who is a professional dancer” as if it changes a thing 😭</p>

      <p>again with the arbitrary titles because you can consider all 9 professional dancers it's what they do for work😭

      <p>that's not how it works sis... the good dancers in the group will never be at hanbin's level even if they dance for kpop for years they won't be professionals unless they enroll in an academy and take LESSONS for that...</p>

      <p>Ok I don't have time to argue with you the good dancers in the group have half the amt of yrs hanbin has. a professional dancer is an arbitrary title and not to mention every member is considered one bcuz they do it for work andddddd ok that's it case closed don't be dumb
