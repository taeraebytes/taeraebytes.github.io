      <p>Hanbin is obviously the best dancer in the group I do think Hao is the better performer maybe the best in the group</p>

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>maybe bc you are not a dancer but at least for me who pays attention to technique there is a clear difference between him vs others. even on idol dancing his technique is still better. 

then there's cases like with yujin and matthew on where i think they are pretty good dancer but imo hao is out dancing them bc zb1 choreography style favours zhang hao a lot bc they are more jazzy choreographies. matthew is really good on choreographies like nkotb but dances like in bloom and yura yura are not that flattering for him bc of his hip hop roots.</p>

      <p>I'm not but I have an interest and I have a few dancer friends obviously my opinion isn't gonna overwrite someone who is lolll I think he does have the best technique because he was a dancer before this but like u said there's songs that don't favor him so the others will do better cuz of the dance foundations that's why I think it can get arbitrary and subjective when it comes to the title and even if there's a difference I think more than one person can hold the main dancer title

      <p>I agree with anon. Actually, pretty similar situation with zb1 line distribution, hanbin can't be best vocalist in the group but his voice suit for zb1 songs the most</p>

      <p>I disagree I notice hanbin gets a lot of the more interesting? Parts like for example riffs high notes ect and I don't think his airy tone is suited to them the songs overall might favor him unlike taerae or smth but they give him parts that don't

      <p>i feel like they picked him over hao or taerae for those notes because hanbins voice is really neutral. if hao or taerae were to do those high notes, the style of the song would have had to change. that last chorus would be sounding completely different. gunwook has tapped into doing high notes since growl (cover) and now at the fancon with the japanese cover, hopefully he will be doing high notes next cause his voice is more on the neutral side too</p>

      <p>oh yea taerae would change the style but imo hao fits in bloom the most and is in a better range but that kind of note mmmm maybe it would've changed idk but I'm ngl I think it's more interesting when there's a tempo or key(?) change in the last chorus. I think they might give gunwook his vocal flowers but also I can't tell if they're just treating him better because of the japan promos. Personally tho I feel like he's such a stylistic singer his covers are always so good in that he puts his own twist so I would want him to do more riff(?) (I barely know vocal terms) heavy parts over high notes but I don't mind yeasssssss

      <p>most of them will struggle tho i don't think anyone besides haorae have a good and stable lower register (hao has the best lower register in the group), kpop focuses heavily on higher and airy tones most kpop idols have very limited range and i don't think zb1 are an exception. But then again every member's range is different so</p>

      <p>taerae supports a lower register down to E3 but it's not his best or most comfortable range, he excels in mixed register, zhang hao supports down to D3 but he has the most stable and controlled lower register in the group, literally just listen to any cover where he uses his low register (esp in chinese), it's so rich and resonant and he's clearly very comfortable in it, i feel like many people underestimate him vocally because he isn't given interesting parts in their songs to showcase his vocals</p>
