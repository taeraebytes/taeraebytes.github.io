      <p>no bc idgaf if you are an akgae but the way some of them come here and say that zb1 is mediocre, that their perfomances/choreos are bad and that the members are boring and this and that but then they turn around and be fans of 5th gen idols with people who can't sing at all. some of those akgaes got me thinking riize were the most prominent dancing group and that zb1 members could never keep up with their choreo, then i watched their perfomances just to find out that the only ones keeping up with their own choreo are wonbin, sohee and stotaro like don't make me laugh.</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the shotaro glazing has rlly taken things too far hes just in his element (hip hop) everyone acts like he's untouchable my goodness... and I thought so too but zb1 are miles better at performing and actually sing live their dance lines and vocal lines are more solid too like zont play w the kings

      <p>I feel like Ricky could sneak in here he just needs to brush up on his skills he's not a bad dancer or a bad singer he's just not the best at either but we can work w that

      <p>See even if I only gaf about gw in terms of units this would be my ideal one because even I know they would compliment eachother nicely and the skill gap isnâ€™t to obvious in different areas</p>
