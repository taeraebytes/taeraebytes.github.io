      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>Hao the best performer in the Group? Girl not when Gunwook is right there... Requeefiem i expected better from you ðŸ˜‚ Gunwook washes all of them when it comes to performing. He can dance really well (something Hao def lacks in) and is good at making facial expressions. GET ON WITH THE PROGRAMM EB</p>

      <p>Imo as someone who's a dance director at a big institutio:

Hao>Gunwook and Matthew>Hanbin>the rest when it comes to performing
Hao is a more feminine sensual performer with subtle expressions which fits the group more and is more versatile, he also sings live and loud often which adds to the performance , Gunwook is a way better dancer and is more powerful but doesn't stand out as much I think Matthew is a bit better in expression, fluidity and versatility but doesn't have Gunwook's power and sheer charisma, Hanbin is an excellent dancer and is beautiful which plays into stage presence but can be quite stiff with his facial expression and sometimes look insecure 

Note that we are judging pop stars here not dancers so just having sheer charisma and a pretty face puts you very high up, which the rest of the group lacks (expect Ricky he has potential)</p>

      <p>sissss what omgðŸ‘€ and I'm nodding my I'm nodding my head hao catches my eye a lot but I guess it can get subjective for me I feel like gunwook hasn't rlly found his footing in his stage aura like he's good but it's probably cus of his gapmoe conflict but okayyyyy

      <p>I think he does like you said the zb1 songs so far have been kind of hard for him and I don't think his lines in crush and yura yura were vocal lines. His tone is nasally but I feel like when he's supported it sounds good I don't mind his singing at all but I need to listen to that wish cover. Like we could rlly go somewhere with Matthew I kind of think his technique is better than Ricky's but Ricky has a much better tone so I place them equally
