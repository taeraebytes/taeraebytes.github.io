      <p>the top 3 is definitely solidified I still think gunwook is the most popular just based off of the fancon and him trending the most during promo but someone else might tell u different

      <p>I saw another anon mention this but I went to both days for fancon ( evening show for 2nd day) and he definitely had some of the loudest cheers. I wouldnâ€™t say heâ€™s top 2 in Japan but I will say his Japan fanbase has had some of the most growth imo the biggest growth since bp. Like back then he wasnâ€™t even in the top 9 for 1 pick here. But Iâ€™d say heâ€™s easily top 3 probably joint third with Matthew. People really like the cuter side of him and his Japanese skills and his visuals were good in the fancon so alot of people likes that too. I donâ€™t know how much it will continue to grow but if any other anons also went to fancon / live or have been living in Japan for the past year they can definitely attest to the fandom growth thing.</p>

      <p>I feel like it's just that hanbin was undervalued for japanese voting when he's clearly in the top 9 for the votes? Because Japan has the highest turnover rates of votes and there's no way he would have been on top 9 global if he wasn't top 9 in Japan.
