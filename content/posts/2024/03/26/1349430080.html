      <p>eh i honestly think that the professional dancer thing is kinda like the singer vs vocalist discourse, there's a lot of singers in kpop but not all of them are vocalist's. the same way that there is a lot of dancers in kpop but not all of them are professional dancers.</p>

      <p>It's similar and the discourse rllt just sticks because at the end of the day no one is truly objective and these titles leave space for discourse I've seen so many ppl use this dance and singing argument on twitter for different idols it just never ends because even people in the dance industry have differing opinions I thought it could be a decent conversation to be had but a lot of these ccs are getting annoying and they're riddled with insecurities
