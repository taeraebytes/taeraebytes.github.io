      <p>the top 3 is definitely solidified I still think gunwook is the most popular just based off of the fancon and him trending the most during promo but someone else might tell u different

      <p>As someone who casually lurks in the jside more than the intl side on Twitter at least Hao and Gunwook are the big 2, I think Matthew dropped a bit and could be replaced by Hanbin soon for 3 because haobin got crazyyy popular lately and then Ricky for sure</p>
