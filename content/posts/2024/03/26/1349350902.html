      <p>the way some members haven't posted on the twitter account for ages while others get so many posts is so annoying</p>

      <p>I rlly feel like a lot of ppl have convinced themselves the socmed posting is stricter than it is yes the managers post for them (how it is for like every group in existence) but I think it's obvious the members that post the most request to post on twitter and the ones who don't don't ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ twitter is a platform they barely use but the ones who post the most are the ones that are pretty active on their bubbles and use the mnet plus stuff

      <p>you think the managers don't have a say in who gets to post or not? i think they do since there have been multiple instances of the members being obviously put on sns ban and saying it's not their turn yet or they need permission to post</p>

      <p>I said it's not as strict I think at this point if gyuvin is ok enough to post frequently so is everyone else ofc they might turn u down a few times but I'm sorry managers completely blocking members is unrealistic and the rotation system is dead clearly

      <p>as long as they dont fuck up as bad as gyuvin (using incel phrases). all the members can decide if they want to post something. they probably have to forward their message and pictures to that one staff who posts them but im sure they can post things if they want to. its normal that some members post more than others, its like this with every kpop group. its nothing new.</p>
