      <p>Get a gitar & siren dance are difficult & the most intersting 
You're downplaying riize performance 
& i must say zb1 cheography is not it wk1 are cheap not wanting to invest in cheography & post production</p>

      <p>Besides the chorus part gag is not hard and zb1 have playfully covered jt many times. See ur missing the point because we all know they have bummy production and their choreo besides dance breaks is low quality it's the level of skill the group has that riize don't and they rlly are just better performers I've watched both
