      <p>idt it matters whether WE seen it but when it leaks into the kgp and I don't mean pann or instiz girlies because they all seen it but they're still kpoppies so it's still within the kpop world but once it leaks to theqoo or the male dominated forum it's done for because homosexuality is still extremely looked down upon in the kgp</p>

      <p>Aside from riize trolls and hanbin akgaes qrting tweets with that photo I don't think it really went viral on the kside? Maybe I missed some tweets but not even bsongeee posted about it unless bsongeee has some morals 😭</p>

      <p>it's too much of old news for bbosongee to post the picture made it's first rounds like immediately after the finale on the kside. Everytime something gay or cheek kiss like the sohee pic goes viral the amt of kfans whe there they're non fans or antis that post that picture and blow up for it is crazy like it's rlly been everywhere and it's always all over weibo
