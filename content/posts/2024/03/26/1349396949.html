      <p>the top 3 is definitely solidified I still think gunwook is the most popular just based off of the fancon and him trending the most during promo but someone else might tell u different

      <p>I saw another anon mention this but I went to both days for fancon ( evening show for 2nd day) and he definitely had some of the loudest cheers. I wouldnâ€™t say heâ€™s top 2 in Japan but I will say his Japan fanbase has had some of the most growth imo the biggest growth since bp. Like back then he wasnâ€™t even in the top 9 for 1 pick here. But Iâ€™d say heâ€™s easily top 3 probably joint third with Matthew. People really like the cuter side of him and his Japanese skills and his visuals were good in the fancon so alot of people likes that too. I donâ€™t know how much it will continue to grow but if any other anons also went to fancon / live or have been living in Japan for the past year they can definitely attest to the fandom growth thing.</p>

      <p>It was so good like I canâ€™t even put into words how immaculate the vibe was like it wasnâ€™t even a concert just a fancon but it was one of the best events Iâ€™ve been too. Also yeah heâ€™s really grown in popularity there and I saw a lot of people asking about him after the fancon aswell because a couple of those cute clips went viral and like you said j fans love cute leaders and heâ€™s got the sort of visual they love. 
On another note I really hope they do some more concerts here within the year ( I leave in 2025) because it was such a good experience and the members themselves looked like they were having such a good time and you could really feel that from the audience.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m there for an exchange program for university, tbh I think it depends on what city you go to obviously in Tokyo youâ€™d probably be able to survive on less Japanese skills but in cities further out youâ€™d need more. Iâ€™d say though to get the full experience itâ€™s good to have good knowledge of it it really does make the whole process smoother. For JLPT I was probably N3/N4 when I first got here but now Iâ€™m definitely N4/N5, I think if you come here with enough to hold a basic convo you will learn so much in the day to day life.</p>
