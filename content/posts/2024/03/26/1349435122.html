      <p>I saw someone saying hao has to fly to China to take a fitness test ðŸ˜‚ but it actually makes sense because in year 1 and 2 of undergraduate degree in China you have to have the fitness test by law and since heâ€™s not been back for a while he probably hasnâ€™t had them yet and might need to have it to graduate.</p>

      <p>I think he left for kr in his 2nd year of his degree is a regular undergrad it will be 3 years but heâ€™s probably going part time rather than full time because of training / being an idol. So he will either graduate this year or next.</p>
