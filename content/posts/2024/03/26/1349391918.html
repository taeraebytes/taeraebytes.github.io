      <p>the top 3 is definitely solidified I still think gunwook is the most popular just based off of the fancon and him trending the most during promo but someone else might tell u different

      <p>I saw another anon mention this but I went to both days for fancon ( evening show for 2nd day) and he definitely had some of the loudest cheers. I wouldnâ€™t say heâ€™s top 2 in Japan but I will say his Japan fanbase has had some of the most growth imo the biggest growth since bp. Like back then he wasnâ€™t even in the top 9 for 1 pick here. But Iâ€™d say heâ€™s easily top 3 probably joint third with Matthew. People really like the cuter side of him and his Japanese skills and his visuals were good in the fancon so alot of people likes that too. I donâ€™t know how much it will continue to grow but if any other anons also went to fancon / live or have been living in Japan for the past year they can definitely attest to the fandom growth thing.</p>

      <p>I feel like it's just that hanbin was undervalued for japanese voting when he's clearly in the top 9 for the votes? Because Japan has the highest turnover rates of votes and there's no way he would have been on top 9 global if he wasn't top 9 in Japan. Its just that the minasangz are just more popular than him there but he's clearly top 4 ever since. 

The only one who is actually surprising is Ricky since he's had so many hit tweets about his looks</p>

      <p>yeah ricky gained so much casual fans bc of his manga character looks but overall i really just think they are so well loved as a group in japan and those who are saying that only one or two members are gaining attention there clearly just see tweets and stories from their own circle bc every member were literally averaging 7k+ likes on tweets for their japan appearances like these jfans just gag over anything and everythinhgjdjs</p>
