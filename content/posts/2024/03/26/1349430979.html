      <p>I saw someone saying hao has to fly to China to take a fitness test ğŸ˜‚ but it actually makes sense because in year 1 and 2 of undergraduate degree in China you have to have the fitness test by law and since heâ€™s not been back for a while he probably hasnâ€™t had them yet and might need to have it to graduate.</p>
