      <p>Hanbin is obviously the best dancer in the group I do think Hao is the better performer maybe the best in the group</p>

      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>being a professional dancer predebut literally doesnt mean you’d be the best dancer among the group i do think hanbin has more knowledge about the technicality of the dance but during actual performances he’s literally not miles better compared to others so its so funny when i see allindans saying “but he’s the only one who is a professional dancer” as if it changes a thing 😭</p>

      <p>again with the arbitrary titles because you can consider all 9 professional dancers it's what they do for work😭

      <p>that's not how it works sis... the good dancers in the group will never be at hanbin's level even if they dance for kpop for years they won't be professionals unless they enroll in an academy and take LESSONS for that...</p>

      <p>Ok I don't have time to argue with you the good dancers in the group have half the amt of yrs hanbin has. a professional dancer is an arbitrary title and not to mention every member is considered one bcuz they do it for work andddddd ok that's it case closed don't be dumb

      <p>Imo calling everyone a professional dancer is kind of demeaning to the actual professional dancers, you may not like hanbin's dancing but he has been a learning a particular genre of dancing for years, has been part of a professional tutting and wacking crew, and has won multiple prizes in competitions. he even won first prize in a self choreography competition when he was 18 and runner up was a we dem boyz member who chorographed in bloom</p>

      <p>I mean when it comes to the air of the title they do it for a living some of them are definitely not good but to only credit one kind of work and involvement and discredit the daily job of others gets funny because who says dancing as ur job and dancing for comps is higher than the other. I'm just pointing out how conservative people like to get about the title like I'm not gonna parade this title for a weak dancer in the group😭😭😭😭 like hanbin has been the professional for the longest and was immersed but that's just my one point it's annoying to see the title used to put down everyone in the group

      <p>full shade but you sound so dumb genuinely just drop the topic how are you gonna say dancing as your job and dancing at competitions is the same like no bro you get judged by professionals and given awards for one and for the other you just have fan girls telling you you ate that!!!1</p>
