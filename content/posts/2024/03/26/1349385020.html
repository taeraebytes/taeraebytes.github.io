      <p>the sm stans rlly sold their souls for the highest level of brainwash JAEHYUN??????????? In range both of them are better sorry the thing is that u also have to consider the training and technique those two are rookies with the most basic training and can hold a candle jaehyun aint all that like Ive never pegged him as an ultra good vocalistðŸ˜­ like he coooo he can sing but the pedestal is crazy and haechan is SO GRATING TO THE EARS JESUSSSSSSSS

      <p>As a rosin I really wish hao has parts that can showcase his vocals skills more like yay great he is getting the chorus but like I need some variety like let him hit a high note as well :/  I think its the reason why it seems like there's no growth</p>

      <p>I feel like they always give the most interesting parts to taerae and especially hanbin like a chorus is rlly not that hard to do

      <p>Different anon but hao has the best vocals in the group I think thatâ€™s obvious without argument but his tone is fuller and richer which is why I think they give hanbin the high note because his lighter tone makes it easier for him to hit? The only way I can explain it is the kick it high note both of them do it and can hit it but itâ€™s easier for hanbin to hit because his voice is more airy, which is my theory for why they give him most the high notes anyway.</p>
