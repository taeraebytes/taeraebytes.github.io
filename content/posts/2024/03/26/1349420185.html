      <p>EVERYONE LEAVE RENJUN ALONE NOW NOW NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW like he literally apologized and almost cried yesterday everyones so mean. My dreamzen friends think it's just weight gain but even the most face heavy weight gainers don't change that much while their bodies stay the same. I'm sure he did gain a bunch of weight but it also looks like moonface to me he might be sick or on some kind of medication
