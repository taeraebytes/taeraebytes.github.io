      <p>I forced my other friends to watch the fancon besides the ones I streamed with and they said it changed their lives they're back to being zerosesssssss. Watching it made me realize that they've grown insanely and that ppl were srsly trying to convince us they're shit I'm looking at these other groups I did not realize zb1 are winning by miles in talent like wow nobody can shit on them but ussss we can't allow it

      <p>iâ€™ve been saying people have been hating on them so unnecessarily and nitpicking them for absolutely no reason while not holding the same standards to other groups like people have personal vendettas against the group or the fandom and then project that on to their perception of the group instead of seeing zb1 just as they are. itâ€™s so tiring tbh the hate they get is so unnecessary</p>

      <p>(oop coming back to talk about the music sorry ) but on this point honestly I'm expecting everyone to say riize will have better music when they drop their album cause they got better producer when pretty much every current sm groups albums besides the tt sound the same meanwhile criticizing and nitpicking zb1 music when they're actually attempting to build a musical identity (and are actually doing IDOL music) no shade towards riize it's just an example</p>

      <p>people are so quick to undermine zb1 like they didn't kick start everything for bgs it's so funny to see and the hate for crush is rlly just down to the previous 4th gen bg song formula. I feel like ppl and non fans who had an extreme hate for crush were chasing clout the beat was cheap yes but it wasn't bad and the song is super nice performed. Me personally I got it the first listen but this all just cope to me they're the only ones building that identity rn!!!!!
