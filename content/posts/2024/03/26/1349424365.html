      <p>Get a gitar & siren dance are difficult & the most intersting 
You're downplaying riize performance

      <p>Besides the chorus part gag is not hard and zb1 have playfully covered jt many times. See ur missing the point because we all know they have bummy production and their choreo besides dance breaks is low quality it's the level of skill the group has that riize don't and they rlly are just better performers I've watched both

      <p>first and foremost when we speak ab dancing we are not considering gyuvin just like how I would never consider eunseok or shotaro or sungchan or Anton for singing the other members have danced to itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
