      <p>no bc idgaf if you are an akgae but the way some of them come here and say that zb1 is mediocre, that their perfomances/choreos are bad and that the members are boring and this and that but then they turn around and be fans of 5th gen idols with people who can't sing at all. some of those akgaes got me thinking riize were the most prominent dancing group and that zb1 members could never keep up with their choreo, then i watched their perfomances just to find out that the only ones keeping up with their own choreo are wonbin, sohee and stotaro like don't make me laugh.</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the shotaro glazing has rlly taken things too far hes just in his element (hip hop) everyone acts like he's untouchable my goodness... and I thought so too but zb1 are miles better at performing and actually sing live their dance lines and vocal lines are more solid too like zont play w the kings
