      <p>I think when it comes to idol dancing which is what they mostly do I don't think he is and it's not a huge disparity between most of dance line when it comes to that anyways but yea hao is the better performer here

      <p>being a professional dancer predebut literally doesnt mean you’d be the best dancer among the group i do think hanbin has more knowledge about the technicality of the dance but during actual performances he’s literally not miles better compared to others so its so funny when i see allindans saying “but he’s the only one who is a professional dancer” as if it changes a thing 😭</p>

      <p>that's not how it works sis... the good dancers in the group will never be at hanbin's level even if they dance for kpop for years they won't be professionals unless they enroll in an academy and take LESSONS for that...</p>

      <p>Ok I don't have time to argue with you the good dancers in the group have half the amt of yrs hanbin has. a professional dancer is an arbitrary title and not to mention every member is considered one bcuz they do it for work andddddd ok that's it case closed don't be dumb

      <p>I'm genuinely shocked like chrjncmdmsmms u have to be pulling my leg I'm gonna need this dumb bit to be over I rlly had to get on google for u morons 😭 "What is a professional dancer? A professional dancer is an individual who has qualifications, skills and training in a particular form of dance. Professional dancers showcase choreographed dance in front of an audience and use their bodies to convey emotions that tell a story" Like I get it hanbins the best dancer in the group and u lot have a sore spot for me but it's time to stop glazing u sound ridiculous

      <p>it’s arbitrary in terms of SKILL bruh just saying professional dancer doesn’t tell you what they excel in, what techniques and styles they’re good at or not, or to what extent that they’re good i can tell y’all aren’t dancers or equipped to have a conversation about dance skill if being professional or not is your only argument as to why they’re good. like if you watch any dance commentary videos by dancers they will bring up idols dance backgrounds never say that an idol is good just because they’re professional they’ll explain the SKILLS</p>
