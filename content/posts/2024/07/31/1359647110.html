      <p>YES I DOOOOOOOOOO it's definitely the swing merge boss up but whatever was in the background of the film sounded good the members aren't begging us to like the music and are staying pretty quiet so I think it'll be good

      <p>Yeah like thereâ€™s been no real doom ments for the members or them asking us to like it ðŸ˜­ the only thing Iâ€™ve really heard about it is when Matthew was asked about his favourite track and he said itâ€™s on the new album and the new albums is really his and hanbinâ€™s style so people were thinking rnb but now Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s sounding good so far anyway</p>

      <p>Like ftp was crazy we were being begged to like the music and we were being warned by the other half ðŸ˜­... crush they were pretty vocal about as well but it was more positive coming from them so the silence rn is interesting. I'm gonna trust it for now those two did like sweat the most and it's the best song on yhmah but I doubt their tt would be rnb anyways

      <p>Yea they did not play about hyping that song so I'm excited if the entire album is to their taste im keeping my expectations low but like I feel so certain the music will be great this time around
