      <p>starting to believe idols actually hate the same ppl they get to talk to on fancalls cause that just gives stalker vibes but the money it brings them keeps it goingðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>yeah some if not most arent even that weird, like these rich girlies obv start off as crazy gf stans but i think with time theyll realize yeah they got no chance ðŸ˜­ so then it becomes this weird long time acquaintance typa relation thing where u update them abour ur life, they talk about latest trends/ dance/ memes and ask if the idols if they can do it and even update them about their life like if they got into a good school or got a new job etc.

a lot of these rich girlies are just lonely and need friends or someone to talk to LMAOO lowkey miskeen ðŸ’”</p>

      <p>From my observations on weibo it seems the bigger fansites with professional photos, photobooks and cafes are more likely to be friendly and calm with their faves (maybe bc of the money aspect?) whilst those who occasioanally at fansigns but more likely follow them around, with a lot of followers, are more likely to be all up in their face and actually annoying</p>

      <p>Yeaaaa I've noticed too especially because they kind of have an influence towards fans and other fansites it's important that each idols top fansite is at these unofficial schedules tbh. It's usually the ones that don't post all the things they do, don't have a reason to be there, and don't even have fansite cameras that are much worse and stalky. In a way there's kind of a business relationship fansites have

      <p>I remember jungkooks biggest fan site headliner used to be the richest fan site bc of the sheer amount of fans who would buy her shit, she got exposed on KaKao talk with a gc spilling how much she makes and also she started saying horrible things about jk if he didn't pose for her bc she was losing  money. She then started stalking him as a result and got onto the blacklist</p>
