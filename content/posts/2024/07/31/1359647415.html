      <p>Yea the dc gall fucked up 🤦‍♀️... so gunwook wanted his own design that he came up with and obviously he's not in charge of actually putting the design down so he just listed the things he wanted and the dc gall just designed a complete plagiarism for the red in ear which is the Korean imperial dragon robe. Then there's claims of Chinese culture appropriation nenenfmmdmfmcmdmmfmdm I was checking the quotes and it isn't any kfans but I looked at his dc gall and the fans want a change people are just scared it could bring gunwook hate cuz there's also a copyright issue. So the designs being publicly denounced by the cbar but we don't know if the designs already been put into production

      <p>Yea the cfans have 2 issues the plagiarism and the culture appropriation but the kfans are just concerned ab the plagiarism/copyright I think it should be changed just cuz I don't want gunwook getting dragged but yea it reminded me of heya 😭😭 the dc gall hasn't responded yet so we'll see

      <p>I saw saw a good 6-8 kfans tweaking why he chose hanja instead of hangul and was saying he was a traitor and should've expected it since the Kor vs Jpn soccer game 😭😭😭😭 I didn't want to bring it up though cause it was only 5-8 schizos 😭</p>

      <p>Alright yea this is the minority they need to move but the hanja matches the traditional Korean aesthetic anyways but for the most part his design was liked but it was a complete rip off 😭😭😭😭😭😭 wait show me the schizos tho
