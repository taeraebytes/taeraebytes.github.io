      <p>The more I see members say stop eating the more I notice how badly this fandom inserts themselves into grown menâ€™s business and dictate how they should feel about something between friends ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>idrc about them doing this shit bc it's kpop it's whatever, i'm used to it, but ngl as a hanbin biased it kinda annoys me that hanbin was called out but the other members faced nothing of the sort like if i was him i'd quote cardi b's "they want you to be mother teresa" on plus chat and log off  ðŸ˜­</p>
