      <p>gyuvin said in the new anniversary video that his dad was strict and i thought about here how ppl said that his parents probably went quite easy on him as it shows in his behaviour so now i'm like ðŸ¤” but maybe he meant in the sense of being disapproving of gyuvin becoming a kpop idol instead of doing whatever it was his parents were gonna send him overseas for and nothing more</p>

      <p>we won't rlly know what gyuvin considers strict but he seriously does come off as someone who's just done whatever he wants and maybe the two can be true. But yea it could be that it could be anything me personally if ur parents let u be an idol idt they're strict ðŸ˜­
