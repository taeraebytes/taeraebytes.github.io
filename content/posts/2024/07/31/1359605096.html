      <p>The more I see members say stop eating the more I notice how badly this fandom inserts themselves into grown menâ€™s business and dictate how they should feel about something between friends ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i still think they should stop saying it on camera at least, like ok we all know the industry almost requires you to have an ed and i feel bad for them, but for the sake of young impressionable fans it should be one of the topics that shouldnâ€™t be discussed publicly</p>
