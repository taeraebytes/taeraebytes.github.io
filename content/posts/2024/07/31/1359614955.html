      <p>to add while magazines are you just try to buy as much as you can for, but for endorsements they just have to buy to whatever "goal" the brand sets for them within a certain amount of time which is what the stock for his gift boxes are 

like for tangle teezer the brand set that goal of 30000 boxes/299 rmb each which was 897w rmb and then mistine set a lower goal of 25000 boxes/299 rmb each which is 747w rmb so crosins were just trying to make both goals and sell out the boxes (they actually did for both anon) if that makes sense, no need for them to buy more than they need to they're already spending a ton in a relatively short amount of time 

sorry this was long but crosins spend a lottttt of money and time on hao & they really work their asses off for him like for comparison a svt member's endorsement that also had gift boxes this month was around 30w rmb. they may be a little crazy sometimes but they are dedicated</p>

      <p>yeah imo not only for crosins but like zb1 cfans in general they tend to be more dedicated than the average kpop stan the fact that all subfandoms were able to either fully or massively contribute to getting members hand mics is something you don't see too often maybe it's a survival show fandom thing also mb the svt guy had 100w+ for his thing lmao</p>

      <p>fan mics aren't that common in general partly because most idols can get them from the company lol other cfandoms i can remember who've done mics are some ive fandoms but still you have to be pretty dedicated to handle smthing like that</p>
