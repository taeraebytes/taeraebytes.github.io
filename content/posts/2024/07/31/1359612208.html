      <p>Isac would be worth it despite the hectic schedule if very popular groups were attending because that way zb1 could promote their cb that's coming in the same month but well</p>

      <p>one thing i don't like about zb1 is their image of being kpop stans like i'm sorryyyyyyyyy everyone finds it cute but something about it doesn't sit right with me. these other idols come across as more exclusive but then u have zb1 fanboying and nothing coming out of it in their favour, just these other idol fans having an ego boost and dick measuring contest 😒 these rookies/nugus at isac need to wanna interact with them and not the other way around i can't have my kings looking like begs no more</p>

      <p>Waittt i wanted to say the exact same here after their dfesta pics where hb and tr were being nctzens with no shame. I think it's fine for them to support their fav artists and there has been times where hb has tried to refrain from over-fanboying. Buttt it rubs me off the wrong way cause like ur idols too, and now I'm like am I stanning a kpop idol or a unserious being💀 LIKE it shouldn't be that deep but something is just so cheap about it please fanboy in private I don't want to see that. Especially as someone who left the nct fandom to stan zb1 it's kinda awkward, and like anon said no nctzen is going to see that and say wow im going to stan them, it just becomes wow look at how much impact nct have in the industry😍</p>

      <p>i notice this with hao's photo with v. hao never said that he's a fan of bts or a v-stan but army's that made it the photo viral are generally just praising v for being idol of idols and calling hao cute. But they won't tune in to zb1's music just because someone is a fanboy of their fave.</p>
