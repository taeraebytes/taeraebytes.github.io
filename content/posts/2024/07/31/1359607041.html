      <p>And of the running sports are a no from me. What i remember from last time it isnâ€™t like an actual track but like a printed tarp/ flooring laid down but itâ€™s never laid down properly so thereâ€™s always these bumps or little bits that stick out that idols always end up tripping on when they run</p>
