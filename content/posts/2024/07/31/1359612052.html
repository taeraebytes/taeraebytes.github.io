      <p>Isac would be worth it despite the hectic schedule if very popular groups were attending because that way zb1 could promote their cb that's coming in the same month but well</p>

      <p>one thing i don't like about zb1 is their image of being kpop stans like i'm sorryyyyyyyyy everyone finds it cute but something about it doesn't sit right with me. these other idols come across as more exclusive but then u have zb1 fanboying and nothing coming out of it in their favour, just these other idol fans having an ego boost and dick measuring contest üòí these rookies/nugus at isac need to wanna interact with them and not the other way around i can't have my kings looking like begs no more</p>
