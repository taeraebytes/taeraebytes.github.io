      <p>The more I see members say stop eating the more I notice how badly this fandom inserts themselves into grown menâ€™s business and dictate how they should feel about something between friends ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>idrc about them doing this shit bc it's kpop it's whatever, i'm used to it, but ngl as a hanbin biased it kinda annoys me that hanbin was called out but the other members faced nothing of the sort like if i was him i'd quote cardi b's "they want you to be mother teresa" on plus chat and log off  ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i mean it was also because he said it to him 3 times in a span of a week or two, i wouldnâ€™t usually care but it was almost becoming one of those jokes that they  like to overuse until it beaten to the ground (or even after if itâ€™s nanbitna) so even some allins were getting alarmed</p>
