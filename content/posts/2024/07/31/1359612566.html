      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i am a stray kids hater but han is all rounder final boss. he dances good enough to fulfill the role, and is top 2 in both vocals and rapping in his group (and heâ€™s an actual rapper not an idol rapper). also heâ€™s a songwriter and producer for the group and his songs are actually good unlike bangchans the quality difference between the songs where heâ€™s the sole writer/composer vs where they work together is so stark itâ€™s sad that held back in the group bc heâ€™s too unpopular to make it as a soloist. he somehow managed to make felix and hyunjin sound palatable which is an incredible feat in its own.</p>

      <p>oooh yeah i was a stay when they were rookies and han is the best vocalist and has the widest range in the group they just wonâ€™t call him main vocal bc hes main rapper their music also got much worse when they started doing even line distribution instead of letting him do both singing and rapping lines</p>

      <p>listen to collision & twilight their 2 best songs easily (at least in the last 4 years) & they were both written completely by han and you can tell bc they donâ€™t sound like stray kids ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. his solo songs are also really good imo listen to maybe and miserable you & me and also 1,2,3,4,5 is pretty good</p>
