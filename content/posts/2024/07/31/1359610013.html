      <p>Hold on someone correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but was mbc gayo the one bts missed because they were in NY and then mbc got butt hurt about it so essentially banned hybe artist from music core because afaik hybe artist didnâ€™t go there for years till they publicly patched up. If thatâ€™s the case it probably is mbc pully nasty moves on zb1.</p>

      <p>Copied this from a forum but this is basically what went down between bts/ big hit (at the time) and mbc so they really could be pulling a 360 on zb1. 

The whole BigHit/MBC thing goes back quite a ways. Some people think it started in 2019 with MBC getting mad at BigHit for what they assumed was not allowing BTS on their special program : Gayo Daejun.

However, it was because BTS had previous schedules that conflicted with the program(There are videos/articles that claim BTS didnâ€™t have anything planned, and that they snubbed MBC but they were actually filming stuff). And BigHit notified MBC in advance.

It goes back even further than the 2017 incident as well.
In 2017 MBC uploaded an image that infuriated a lot of ARMYs, mostly K-Diamonds were affected by this image as it was of a former president. The image was suppose to reflect the â€˜Mr. Leeâ€™ who was trying to blackmail BigHit at that time. (Donâ€™t worry, no one succeeded in blackmailing BigHit, theyâ€™re not fools and it wasnâ€™t BigHitâ€™s first time dealing with blackmail *gough*glam*cough*)
In the end MBC claimed it was a mistake and put out an apology.

But like I said, it goes back further-
MBC was one of the stations who cut performances and conveniently had camera workers who just.. were not on their game, but only during BTSâ€™s performances.
Let us never forget that Gayo Daejun performance from 2014 when we got pissed cause MBCâ€™s camera work for BTS stage was an absolute joke. So much of a joke that BigHit fired back with a video of 3 different camera angles (And we went wild and loved this clap back- Still one of the top 5 clap backs from BigHit)

Hereâ€™s the performance MBC put out:

And BigHitâ€™s clap back:

So yeah, BigHit and MBC have had this rocky relationship for a long time. 2019 was the last straw though. MBC hasnâ€™t been refusing to have BigHit groups on though- I think itâ€™s been BigHit not submitting to MBCâ€™s ridiculous demands. Thatâ€™s my personal take though. It just be MBC not wanting to give BigHit groups spotlight.. but BigHit doesnâ€™t need MBC. That much is very clear.


So yeah had they not gone mbc really could have cut them out from their music show and other programmes like weekly idol, the manager, radio star ect</p>
