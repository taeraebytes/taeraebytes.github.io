      <p>to add while magazines are you just try to buy as much as you can for, but for endorsements they just have to buy to whatever "goal" the brand sets for them within a certain amount of time which is what the stock for his gift boxes are 

like for tangle teezer the brand set that goal of 30000 boxes/299 rmb each which was 897w rmb and then mistine set a lower goal of 25000 boxes/299 rmb each which is 747w rmb so crosins were just trying to make both goals and sell out the boxes (they actually did for both anon) if that makes sense, no need for them to buy more than they need to they're already spending a ton in a relatively short amount of time 

sorry this was long but crosins spend a lottttt of money and time on hao & they really work their asses off for him like for comparison a svt member's endorsement that also had gift boxes this month was around 30w rmb. they may be a little crazy sometimes but they are dedicated</p>
