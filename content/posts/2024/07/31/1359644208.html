      <p>Yea the dc gall fucked up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... so gunwook wanted his own design that he came up with and obviously he's not in charge of actually putting the design down so he just listed the things he wanted and the dc gall just designed a complete plagiarism for the red in ear which is the Korean imperial dragon robe. Then there's claims of Chinese culture appropriation nenenfmmdmfmcmdmmfmdm I was checking the quotes and it isn't any kfans but I looked at his dc gall and the fans want a change people are just scared it could bring gunwook hate cuz there's also a copyright issue. So the designs being publicly denounced by the cbar but we don't know if the designs already been put into production
