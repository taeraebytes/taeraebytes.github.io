      <p>Isac would be worth it despite the hectic schedule if very popular groups were attending because that way zb1 could promote their cb that's coming in the same month but well</p>

      <p>one thing i don't like about zb1 is their image of being kpop stans like i'm sorryyyyyyyyy everyone finds it cute but something about it doesn't sit right with me. these other idols come across as more exclusive but then u have zb1 fanboying and nothing coming out of it in their favour, just these other idol fans having an ego boost and dick measuring contest üòí these rookies/nugus at isac need to wanna interact with them and not the other way around i can't have my kings looking like begs no more</p>

      <p>can we stop this exclusiveness of zb1? they are rookie and they have limited time, they need to interact with many idols and fans to gain public awarenesses also to give attention to their fans the fullest they can. even if they only stay there without winning something at least we have some moment to remember as ot9 too.</p>

      <p>there are tons of idols will be there why only mention lun8s? what wrong with them? and gain public awareness is not only interacting with other idol but it can be by taking some activities which could be broadcast on public platform. if they have good connection they could be a commentator on that event. everything is opportunity.</p>
