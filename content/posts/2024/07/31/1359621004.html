      <p>most of these kpop stans especially zb1 stans donâ€™t even listen to or even LIKE rap (especially given how predebut they were literally whining about zb1 even possibly having rap in their songs) so i wouldnâ€™t give their opinions on rap even an ounce of worth</p>

      <p>I liked Topâ€™s and 2ne1 rapping and bts rappers are listenable. Rap from everyone else from well known groups are annoying to listen to.</p>
