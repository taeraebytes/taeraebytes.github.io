      <p>Wakeone keeps pissing kzeroses off like the isac lineup is so nugu no one will be tuning in except for the fanbases that attend seriously its just bad useless promo. They need rest! They will have their cb as well. What if they get injured? Dumb decisions  again and again</p>

      <p>Hold on someone correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but was mbc gayo the one bts missed because they were in NY and then mbc got butt hurt about it so essentially banned hybe artist from music core because afaik hybe artist didnâ€™t go there for years till they publicly patched up. If thatâ€™s the case it probably is mbc pully nasty moves on zb1.</p>
