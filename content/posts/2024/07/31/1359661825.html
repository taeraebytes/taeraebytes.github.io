      <p>The more I see members say stop eating the more I notice how badly this fandom inserts themselves into grown men’s business and dictate how they should feel about something between friends 😭</p>

      <p>idrc about them doing this shit bc it's kpop it's whatever, i'm used to it, but ngl as a hanbin biased it kinda annoys me that hanbin was called out but the other members faced nothing of the sort like if i was him i'd quote cardi b's "they want you to be mother teresa" on plus chat and log off  😭</p>

      <p>i mean it was also because he said it to him 3 times in a span of a week or two, i wouldn’t usually care but it was almost becoming one of those jokes that they  like to overuse until it beaten to the ground (or even after if it’s nanbitna) so even some allins were getting alarmed</p>
