      <p>archery - im fine with it, no human contact 
futsal - ABSOLUTELY NO STAY THE FUCK AWAY WE DONT NEED NO BROKEN ANKLES AND SHATTERED SHINS esp cause these ppl arent professional and be fouling left and right
track - ig like 50 / 100 meter is fine? cause its just a straight line but NO FUCKING RELAY THOSE FUCKING CORNERS ARE DEADLY like thats prob 50% fatality rate
esports - idk if theres that section this time but sure and they seem to be gamers so itll be fun

idk what else theyre doing but like lets just be cheer leaders and play mafia</p>
