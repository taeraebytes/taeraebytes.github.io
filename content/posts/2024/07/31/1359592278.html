      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Nah. Haechan is a weakass singer but he supports the best in dream.  Mk is at gyuvin's level of support. Hc is at jiwoong's level.</p>

      <p>Man is full of shit lol guess his vocalist members donâ€™t like him enough to help him out and they know itâ€™s useless to tell him anything 
Contrast nct with zb1 where Taerae and Hao help out the weaker ones</p>
