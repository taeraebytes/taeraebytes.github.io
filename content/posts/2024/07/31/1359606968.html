      <p>Tr and hao are a good vocalist due l hope they make their names known during zb1 short time also if zb1 is gonna have collabs during end of year shows l wish they put efforts & plan well as l want them to go viral like what happened with emka anniversary & energetic stages rather than the low effort kcon stage which is a wasted opportunity to shine l'm actually side eyeing bnd they played their games well with those covers throughout the year & raised their group name in the industry so wk1 should start planning from now
Gunwook collab stage I'm anticipating</p>
