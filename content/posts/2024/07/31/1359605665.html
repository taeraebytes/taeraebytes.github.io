      <p>Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m sayingggg like that company has him on a leash and I get why because heâ€™s not even in the company and heâ€™s their most profitable artist and if they are able to manage him well they can get there foot into a lot of industry sectors through him e.g dance and variety and hosting ect. Honestly i genuinely think he will only leave if a big 4 offers him something which is next to impossible anyway but after lsfm i never say never. But good for him ig, they treat him really well there and heâ€™s liked and i can tell that they will support him well in whatever he chooses to do .</p>
