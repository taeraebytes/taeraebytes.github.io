Imagine it's like ur customized community and timeline and also tag you can tag the super topic name like a hashtag so people can find it easy if they're interested and join and become fans and participate and everything. Think of it like this imagine gunwook used the #PARKGEONWOOK tag on tiktok and then we all found out that it's #PARKGUNWOOK you can't transfer all the views and likes ur starting over. That's how I think it is but I could be wrong I don't use weibo often but it also affects xhs too and literally any Chinese socmed his fans might be on his name was spelled incorrect"

      <p>did u hear about gunwooks cbar 'drama' but not really drama? apparently for boys planet and early zb1 (I think) he had a cbar using the correct hanja but either wakeone or gunwook used the other hanja version instead so then his cfans had to make an entire new cbar from scratch with that new hanja only for it to be the first version LOOOL ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>It's not a cbar but his super topic ðŸ˜­ and yes I know it was the company that changed it randomly and the fans just moved to a new super topic and now that gunwook confirmed since he had to ask his mom cfans have been using the wrong one all along. He said it a while ago too before his in ears were released with his hanja name that the character for rising sun is correct. I can't blame his cfans for being irked because everything they've tagged him under for a year has been wrong
