      <p>This is why you shouldn't shit on idols especially the ones who take criticism seriously. As an allin who pay attention to a lot of what happens on kside since it is what Hanbin will be noticing, I always found him correct criticism immediately. For example after people said his forehead exposed hairstyle didn't look good + the expression during crush first music broadcast in instiz, he then did bangs covered hairstyle the next day, came live asked if we liked the hairstyle today. He isn't someone who deserves hate, you can criticise him fairly but don't make it something you laugh at because he is someone who can actually get hurt by that. Also I have seen great improvement in his stage presence and expression after sweat. Also recently he is paying even more attention to fans, he knows everytime when fans doesn't like something. And I know you won't agree but he had the best stage presence for psycho cover.</p>
