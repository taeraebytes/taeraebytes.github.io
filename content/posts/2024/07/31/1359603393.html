      <p>Well yes armys are delusional and i don't even like BTS and yes they're not some grand vocalists but nothing incorrect was said in that cc jungkook is quite a bit better than haechan and taehyung is slightly better than haechan with his mixed and lows quality being better maybe falsetto can go to haechan but he always has that nasality present with his support and jin is better than chenle and renjun since he has shown more moments of support than them and jimin is of course terrible so are jeno jisung jaemin etc so ya overall neither of them are great but BTS is still better</p>

      <p>Okay this is maybe not really related to the discourse but kpop stan need to talk about consistency too when we talk about support or not, some idols support their notes one timing is not it</p>
