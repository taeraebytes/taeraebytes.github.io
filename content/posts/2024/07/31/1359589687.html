      <p>I‚Äôm literally still seeing it like every time there‚Äôs a mass tweak trust there will be groups of them saying ‚Äúwakeone doing this for their new flop group‚Äù or when people talk about disbandment or possible extension ‚Äúthey already signed some of them for their new group‚Äù and we alllll know who they mean üò≠</p>

      <p>Sorry sis but they definitely do say it about hanbin he was the og if you will üò≠ they think that everything he‚Äôs getting is because he‚Äôs already signed for new ‚Äòwakeonez‚Äô but the idea that the 4 (hb tr gw mt) are new wakeonez as a collective really took off after yura yura because the members were finally getting regular schedules and they didn‚Äôt like it or couldn‚Äôt see why other members were getting good schedules too without there being the new wakeonez hidden agenda</p>

      <p>I rmbr when everything sparked with yura yura but after all the ms song stuff it just switched over to he's building his solo career for his future company that's what I see the most at least but he was definitely the og can he take his crown back...
