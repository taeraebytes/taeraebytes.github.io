      <p>I'm gonna give a superficial description of the rising signs chose what fits to the jebis obviously astrology isn't that simple the houses and their planets are gonna play a lot into it etc etc this is just for fun 

Aries rising, celebrities are Rihanna, Diana ross, Celine Dion, Anya Taylor joy, heath ledger, Kendall jenner
They usually have an intensity to them, a prominent head esp top of their head, can be impatient, straightforward, kinda extra, can be competitive 

Taurus rising celebrities Mariah Carey Gigi Hadid Cate blanchett  Miley Cyrus Robert Pattinson 
looks classy and luxurious, stubborn, nice voice, can be stockier or fuller but still natural beauty or pleasing to the eye can be kinda lazy 

Gemini rising lady gaga Kamala harris Amy Whinehouse will smith
Smart, all the people ik with this are really intelligent and usually have a aquillian nose lol theyre cute and have this mischievous look can be very multifaceted and sociable even if they seem quiet at first very adaptable love learning they find answers very quickly 

Cancer rising celebrities Angelina Jolie Margot Robbie the weeknd kehlani
Deeply emotional very quiet sensitive and a little pushy usually short and can be fuller esp in the breast area lol mom friend very empathetic and intuitive emotions over logic 

Leo rising Tyler the creator drake lizzo Marilyn Monroe Selena Gomez demi Lovato 
Naturally attracts attention and are the center of attention, exude warmth and are naturally charismatic, usually take care of their hair a lot or are naturally bald lol can be kinda childish and overly emotional as seem by the celebs line up light up any room they're in love gossip and drama love giving and being gifted things can be good actors or play a role

Virgo rising Emma Watson Timoth√©e chalamet, dolly parton Janelle monae jay z
Acts of service people Def the people where you can't sometimes tell if they like you or not cause the try to repress so hard, very classy on the outside, have an outer shell, very  very smart similar to Gemini rising but more stable, want to seem out together, very detail oriented, don't like acknowledging their feelings, looks young, very hard worker

Libra rising Kendrick Lamar Beyonce Doja Cat Britney spears 
Naturally pretty and charming, prince vibes, sociable and fair, great at charming an audience, naturally draw in people, gets irritated easily, radiant smile also intelligent can be kinda fake tho, harsh life they usually try to be polite when they're angry at first and then start tweaking lmaoo</p>
