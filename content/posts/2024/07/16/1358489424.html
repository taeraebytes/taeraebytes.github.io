      <p>I hate that whenever things like that happen is that people who aren't public figures get hit, op just made a post against fetishism I guess that Hao just randomly likes years ago and still gets hit, his exes that he broke up w years before still get hit like people could have the decency to censor their usernames and faces they're just random civilians</p>
