      <p>Do you think what happened with soobin & taehyun is the reason why txt have less hype their contract will end soon & can't predict what will happen to them but sometime i feel people are hyped about enh more than them the same situation as itzy disappearing from kpop radar & although nmixx is also flopping but they're more talked about generally</p>
