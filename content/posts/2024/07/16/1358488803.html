      <p>Idk if you guys saw that empire state of mind that someone did with 127 but omg that edit still gives me goosebumps. 127 ran the states idc. 

They could be royalty and more but sm decided to favor nct dream like fuck them.</p>

      <p>Yea dream was kind of a stupid choice since they were more popular in sea and korea but 127 had a hold on the west

      <p>imo mark also gets kinda boring when he's with dream like that's a king when he's with 127 but he doesn't have that much fun presence to me in dream. haechan is a mess whenever he was at but i am ngl when he shaded dream while he was with 127 it was so fun.</p>

      <p>Finally someone said it dream are not that funny, like imo the best funny moments for kpop groups comes out of random pairings and nct dream are wayyy too close and bff vibe it feels like peeking into a friendship group ur not part of. while 127 have very distinct personalities mark can bounce off johnnys stronger jokes , its just weird that hes the oldest in dream</p>
