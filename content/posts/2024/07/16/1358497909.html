      <p>Hmm diff anon and idk if I'm looking into it too much but just from how he goes by 'Ricky' instead of his Chinese name seems significant to me in where he wants to be? Like for the magazine he only introduced himself as Ricky and for Keep Running his name tag was also Ricky in English when they coulda used his Chinese name and he actually has a legal Chinese name because he was born there. I think he'll just be like every other c kidol, do kpop and dabble in cent stuff every now and then.

This may be reaching but he loves his piercings and tattoos too much to leave for cent ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>idk if he would wanna be in it himself but I was thinking just how he'd do if he did and before it kinda seemed liked a dead deal compared to now. But yea maybe he won't

      <p>Yeah I think it really depends on Yuehua and if they care about what he wants tbh because I feel like they'll definitely send him to cent seeing how fast he's growing there but idk I feel like he'll be depressed af knowing his personality and how controlling cent is ðŸ˜­ Also that one anon brought up a good point, K Yuehua has nothing going on just dust and cobwebs so they might keep ZB1 Yuehuaz in Kpop to keep their building up and send Hariboz for Cent schedules every now and then like now.</p>
