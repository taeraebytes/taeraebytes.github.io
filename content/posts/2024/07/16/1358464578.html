      <p>I'm gonna be sooooo honest I get it but also my first thought was that I didn't care maybe I'm just so indifferent to hanbin I'm not moved I understand all the sides but I just really couldn't bring myself to care but that's a personal thing. I get the upset since all we do is complain about the work that gets poured into the group and the lack of quality and care it's pretty jarring to see and disappointing. But I'm also considering the creative freedom idols get on aotm as well and they really would do just about anything the idols request on there so it wouldn't have been hard to get him an og song to sing to if he asked for one esp since I've been getting other ccs saying it was made by the people who made dear eclipse so it could've been a demo who knows. Then there's the other Side of people bringing up always well idk if hanbin would ever perform this song outside of the video and have the song officially released so idk ab all that but damn this got way too long but im just trynna say i don't care or at least not like most of the people who are mad like the aotm isn't really gonna help the group in any way so what he does with is whatever to me it was always going to be something that would just benefit him anyways

      <p>i feel like when you guys say his solo gigs do nothing for the group is rooted in your personal dislike for him and your lack of faith in him idk like it really does have the power to invite someone to be interested in zb1 if they see their main dancer doing something cool like it won't give zb1 a million sales or make them the gp's faves but that's asking a fucking lot for no reason. for example when hao gets a magazine cover or a solo brand deal and gets 100k sales from crosins it does nothing for the group but noobody says it the way you guys target hb</p>

      <p>solo gigs do nothing for the group whether it's hanbins aotm or haos magazine cover I've said this 100 times ultimately the aotm isn't gonna promote the group no aotm has ever done that ðŸ˜­

      <p>Is this a joke???? Twice were completely dominating kpop and were the first GG to sell like men during their first years, their popularity decreased naturally but the full group thing was an excellent idea from jyp</p>
