      <p>KCON Germany's lineup is even worse, imo (Ik it's just the rumored lineup and there're still a few more acts to be announced, but still) like I don't give a shit about dreamcatcher, evnne, the boyz, riize or Jo1 bruh. Just give me zb1ðŸ˜­(Ik they're on tour (I'm gonna kill myself)) or idk enhypen
