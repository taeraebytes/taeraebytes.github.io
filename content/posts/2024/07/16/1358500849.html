      <p>hmmmm if anons dont want to share their twt @s and if you really want to do interrogations to make sure anons actually been here for a long time use cc usernames instead and interrogate us here and if we pass only then u send the discord link to us privately and that way no one knows who we are on twt

also maybe make an announcement to change discord nickname every month or something so if someone does try to leak the discord to stan twt with screenshots all our names would be diff by then and no one knows whos who ðŸ¤£</p>

      <p>mmmm not everyone has accounts on here but I feel like everyone's kinda too scared that's a good idea tho I think the servers a cool idea but I'm probably rushing it we can revisit another time

      <p>true oh maybe u can just make an interrogation questionnaire here with all the questions you want to ask by sending yourself a CC here if that makes sense,

How long you been here?

How'd you find my cc?

Which member do anons anonymously hate most and why?

How many times did Queef get cancelled?

What is your discord username? etc

So then you don't have to solo talk to every single anon and which ever anon wants to join can answer that cc and only if they pass it you add them since we already answered with our dc username and anons don't have to make a cc account or share twt</p>
