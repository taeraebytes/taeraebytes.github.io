      <p>no it's just cuz they're in japan lol they were back tgthr for March and I mean I don't blame Matthew for not interacting with him not just cuz of the scandal but jiwoong literally distanced himself and stopped ppusamz himself it wasn't Matthew so he just moved on the duo was only remnants of their fake bp onscreen clout ship a few months into zb1 anyways
