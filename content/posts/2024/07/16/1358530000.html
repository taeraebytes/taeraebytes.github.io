      <p>This is not the same but also the same topic I noticed in zerose twt people rarely change biases and if they do they get crucified for it and made out to be an anti where in other fandoms I was in you could change bias easily and it was never a big issue. Like changing bias is something so normal sometimes after a period of time you grow more fond of another person, I lowkey wonder if thatâ€™s why some zerose become ia or choose to leave because they canâ€™t publicly come out and say they changed bias</p>
