      <p>ricky def gives tao vibes. both coming from rich families, handsome in unconventional ways, weird laughs, they kinda act the same ways, struggle with language, good at sports (basketball), MISTREATED. only difference is ricky can sing and tao doesn't, and ricky is def more respectful than tao (although tao debuted much younger than ricky), oh and tao was more physically affectionate towards his members than ricky</p>
