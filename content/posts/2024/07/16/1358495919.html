      <p>Well if its genetic theres not a huge deal you can do. for skin its obvious but always see whats the issues in ur life u can change like sleep, facial excercises or massages, eating more nutrients. then theres serums like caffeine, retinol, eye creams you can try, these usually pair up well for makeup coverage and for most ppl isnt long-term. this is from my experience as a cosmetology student lol theres even surgeries done to try lighten that area up its v tricky to deal with as it focuses more on the loose skin and not pigmentation</p>

      <p>sorry if it was a bit too real, I shadowed a dermatologist clinician for 3 months last year and honestly they thrive off lying to people even pharmacists can be better help sometimes. but on a personal note I used to have horrible hyperpigmentation on my face passed down by my family, but implementing retinol treatment from urban skin, cerave products, doing turmeric masks every other day ,,  be careful if ur light skinned,, basically helped evened my tone to the point u can't notice dark circles thoguh they do return when i don't sleep or periods. there's soo many products it can be confusing, try to start off by smaller serums first for any new ingredients, test try until you find something that works. SORRY THIS IS LONG, I talk a lot when it comes to skincare dhdjdn</p>
