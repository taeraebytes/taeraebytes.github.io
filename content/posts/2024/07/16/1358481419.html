      <p>the kpop fan stereotype like in us/europe does not equal the same in asia cause here in asia they are typically richer (prettier, i guess the privilege to access for surgery/derma) as they can afford those crazy expensive tics out hereâ€¦ i mean lower income/middle class can barely even buy merch</p>

      <p>hmmm like kpop is seen as more of a rich girl thing? I guess because in the us and Europe it's a norm not to attend concerts or buy merch unless ur rlly dedicated

Not every pretty asian girl in asia that's into kpop is rich or did ps, it can be due to many factors that an avg poor citizen can do such as exercise, diet, facial massage aka guasha and proper makeup and styling and it's not because of kpop they're doing these things its to fit the beauty standard.</p>
