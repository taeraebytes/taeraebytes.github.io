      <p>to be very honest i maybe another specific case as a rosin cos i literally felt nth about whatâ€™s going on rn. when hanbin was announced as aotm I wasnâ€™t surprised cos heâ€™s literally the cj/wk1 nepo baby of the group. in fact I EXPECTED that itâ€™d be him cos if not him first, then who? when the solo was announced I also wasnâ€™t feeling any kind of emotion cos I think hanbin is just kinda uhmâ€¦ ded to me? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he can do whatev he wants like flop or go viral and iâ€™d still wouldnâ€™t spare him a glance anymore im actually so indifferent to hb even i get shocked at myself sometimes</p>

      <p>NRNNFNRMFMMZMXMMCMFMMDMSM its indifference and that's pretty much my reaction too I didn't care that he did a solo like I just don't omg I'm seriously not understanding the outrage I said we were stopping this but kind of a refreshing reaction every other rosin was angry
