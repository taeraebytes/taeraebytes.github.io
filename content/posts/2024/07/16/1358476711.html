Same goes for when you search zb1/zerobaseone with the names the results differ so that makes me think the algorithm for what counts for the singer category (the one that 5th gen account posted) is kind of weird because there is no way hao is the 5th most searched member and the other weird thing would be that Matthew is the least searched member in the group according to this algorithm but when searched simply with his name or with zb1 he is usually 4th or 5th. Ricky is 100% first place though in all categories except that singer topic that the account in twitter posted so again sth is weird with that",
