      <p>Well if its genetic theres not a huge deal you can do. for skin its obvious but always see whats the issues in ur life u can change like sleep, facial excercises or massages, eating more nutrients. then theres serums like caffeine, retinol, eye creams you can try, these usually pair up well for makeup coverage and for most ppl isnt long-term. this is from my experience as a cosmetology student lol theres even surgeries done to try lighten that area up its v tricky to deal with as it focuses more on the loose skin and not pigmentation</p>

      <p>i feel like as a society we're dtm over dark circles like to the point where every makeup look is accompanied by a base that has under eye concealer 50 shades lighter than the skintone to "brighten" most people dont even have crazy under eye circles like that it's just how eyes look ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i have never talked to a person irl and took notice of their under eyes</p>

      <p>yea I've always known I have pretty dark under eyes but I didn't start getting mad at them till I started wearing makeup ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and the bright under eye trend irks me so bad more often than not people just look fucking crazy mine are pretty noticeable but it gets better when I tan in the summer
