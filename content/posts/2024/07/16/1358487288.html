      <p>I'm gonna be sooooo honest I get it but also my first thought was that I didn't care maybe I'm just so indifferent to hanbin I'm not moved I understand all the sides but I just really couldn't bring myself to care but that's a personal thing. I get the upset since all we do is complain about the work that gets poured into the group and the lack of quality and care it's pretty jarring to see and disappointing. But I'm also considering the creative freedom idols get on aotm as well and they really would do just about anything the idols request on there so it wouldn't have been hard to get him an og song to sing to if he asked for one esp since I've been getting other ccs saying it was made by the people who made dear eclipse so it could've been a demo who knows. Then there's the other Side of people bringing up always well idk if hanbin would ever perform this song outside of the video and have the song officially released so idk ab all that but damn this got way too long but im just trynna say i don't care or at least not like most of the people who are mad like the aotm isn't really gonna help the group in any way so what he does with is whatever to me it was always going to be something that would just benefit him anyways

      <p>i feel like when you guys say his solo gigs do nothing for the group is rooted in your personal dislike for him and your lack of faith in him idk like it really does have the power to invite someone to be interested in zb1 if they see their main dancer doing something cool like it won't give zb1 a million sales or make them the gp's faves but that's asking a fucking lot for no reason. for example when hao gets a magazine cover or a solo brand deal and gets 100k sales from crosins it does nothing for the group but noobody says it the way you guys target hb</p>

      <p>solo gigs do nothing for the group whether it's hanbins aotm or haos magazine cover I've said this 100 times ultimately the aotm isn't gonna promote the group no aotm has ever done that ðŸ˜­

      <p>Im sorry queef, I appreciate everything you said but based on my experience in my whole kpop fangirling, i got to know some of my ult group like itzy bcs of their solo gigs. Like yeji got my interest and made me searched about their group and I become their fan. Yeji supposedly my bias since she captured my attention and I really like her but after knowing all the members I ended up biasing both yeji and ryujin. Another one is from bts, imagine I just saw V and I say he is so handsome and cute so I search about bts. I started watching their reality show way back 2015 and ended up biasing JKðŸ˜­ Same in exo when I saw Kai in Mama 2015, but I ended up biasing Luhan instead. That's how it works queef. Not all people are same. Sone will start to a single member before knowing the group.</p>

      <p>I didn't mean it in the way that no new fans would ever come out of solo gigs there are fans that come from noticing one member sometimes BUT solo gigs have never brought in fans at a rate even close to unit or group gigs and they always do more for the individual. And you're bringing up moments where you just see the idol like Kai was at mama.. with his groupðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­  sorry solo gigs have never done buffs for a group like I used to stan tbz and they had really good group opportunities and group content with solo stuff and nothing for example juyeon ever did brought in fans for the group significantly

      <p>you guys cannot keep comparing them to non-temporary groups, the circumstances are just drastically different. what hanbins gonna show in aotm will not resemble anything zb1 ever does, so people who like it will check out zb1 and probably check right out or solo stan. and thats not hanbin's fault that wakeone sucks at showcasing their individual strengths within group releases and cant choose or develop a concept that fits all of them, i dont even think it's all wakeone's fault tbh considering the nature of their formation and contract. but gaining new group fans is an uphill battle and the few that do trickle in through individual promotion are far more likely to invest in an individual than a group, it's just the nature of the beast and the reason why we all want more group emphasis in their general promotion bc thats the only thing that benefits everyone.</p>

      <p>Exactly like I'm sorry in what world are we considering the benefit of solo work over group work that just makes zero sense and this whole argument shouldn't even be happening it's very similar they're a group so they should promote group gigs and content simple as that
