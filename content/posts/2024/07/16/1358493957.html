      <p>Well if its genetic theres not a huge deal you can do. for skin its obvious but always see whats the issues in ur life u can change like sleep, facial excercises or massages, eating more nutrients. then theres serums like caffeine, retinol, eye creams you can try, these usually pair up well for makeup coverage and for most ppl isnt long-term. this is from my experience as a cosmetology student lol theres even surgeries done to try lighten that area up its v tricky to deal with as it focuses more on the loose skin and not pigmentation</p>
