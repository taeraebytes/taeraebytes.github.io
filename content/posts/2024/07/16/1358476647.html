For example the tweet that was posted with the results from that 5th gen account they searched according to some singer topic of their names but if you search generally their names the results differ a lot. For example if you search zhang hao as a singer then he is lower than Kim jiwoong as a singer but if you search zhang hao vs Kim jiwoong as search topics then Zhang hao is a lot more popular than Kim jiwoong and this is the case for many other members.",
