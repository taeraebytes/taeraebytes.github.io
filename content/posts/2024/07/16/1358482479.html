      <p>I didn't really care like at all I was talking to my friends about it and it just kinda felt like something he got to have that was better than what the group gets but I know that aotm allows for creative control so it's also him putting in the work for his personal thing like I can see why other people are mad an stuff but that's about it like we're all gona forget this probably
