      <p>God an original song is a bad idea on so many levels, his hunger for solo success sometimes borders on stupidity this is just bad marketing at least half of it should've been a trendy song ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

      <p>yea compared to choosing another artists songs an original is dumb imo it becomes a whole nother thing of the song itself being good enough to garner attention otherwise it becomes forgotten since it's not official

      <p>I don't think the quality even matters there's very little chance it's gonna garner attention even if mnet pays to make it a youtube ad like the risk isn't worth it they revived that show specifically for him and gave him more privileges compared to the average aotm and instead of doing something that would actually garner attention for the group (bcs let's be honest he's never gonna get that big solo career) by choosing already popular songs that people would be interested in he choses an original song..I'm not a rosin akgae at all I'm complaining as a fan of the group</p>

      <p>aotm has always been about artistic freedom so I'm not rlly sure if we can say he got more leeway but using popular songs could've brought in an audience but it's a lot about if his performance is good enough I personally didn't like the song so his dance is gonna have to hard carry
