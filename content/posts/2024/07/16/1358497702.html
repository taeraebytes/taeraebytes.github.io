      <p>I've seen the sentiment a lot as well it's two sides to it ig but I'm much more positive that he's not attending maybe there's a chance there will be acknowledgment but idek cuz it's a nomination rn they could probably make an article if he wins

      <p>i think everyone knows itâ€™s already likely he wonâ€™t attend, but some ppl are tweeting that they want him to go which is to be expected. but the majority are literally just asking them to acknowledge it since he won with a huge gap. like most tweets ive seen are just asking how there still hasnâ€™t been anything from wakeone when everyone else at least as 1 tweet about it ðŸ˜­</p>
