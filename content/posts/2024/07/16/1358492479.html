      <p>i feel so bad for ggs bc it does seem more common for girls who are into kpop to take care of their appearance compared to guys like im thinking of that j-idol(?) who said she has never seen a good looking fanboy in her career like damn ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i was at wjsn concert in seoul a couple yrs after they debuted and it was 80% male, the only girls i saw were fansites and it absolutely reeked in there esp cause it was delayed for a while, everyone around me were sweating like cows and i felt like the only person who actually put effort into my appearance. so i got a lott of interactions from the members then and im pretty sure it was cause i was the only decent looking person  ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ thankfully they gained a lottt of female fans as the years went by but i unstanned after my bias left</p>
