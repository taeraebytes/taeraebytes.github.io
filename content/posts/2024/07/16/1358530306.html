      <p>Hmm diff anon and idk if I'm looking into it too much but just from how he goes by 'Ricky' instead of his Chinese name seems significant to me in where he wants to be? Like for the magazine he only introduced himself as Ricky and for Keep Running his name tag was also Ricky in English when they coulda used his Chinese name and he actually has a legal Chinese name because he was born there. I think he'll just be like every other c kidol, do kpop and dabble in cent stuff every now and then.

This may be reaching but he loves his piercings and tattoos too much to leave for cent ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>idk if he would wanna be in it himself but I was thinking just how he'd do if he did and before it kinda seemed liked a dead deal compared to now. But yea maybe he won't

      <p>Yeah I think it really depends on Yuehua and if they care about what he wants tbh because I feel like they'll definitely send him to cent seeing how fast he's growing there but idk I feel like he'll be depressed af knowing his personality and how controlling cent is ðŸ˜­ Also that one anon brought up a good point, K Yuehua has nothing going on just dust and cobwebs so they might keep ZB1 Yuehuaz in Kpop to keep their building up and send Hariboz for Cent schedules every now and then like now.</p>

      <p>I think Ricky is also quite unquote safer for the cent industry Hao will always have to stay within a niche for obvious reasons Ricky can go further and try to get more of the gp through acting and variety the only thing would be what his parents do in his us or if he ever changes his nationality that would make it impossible for him to have a career there</p>

      <p>ur not saying this outloud u could've put quotations ðŸ˜­ but I've heard people say Ricky would have to let things go like probably his English name and change his appearance

      <p>No obviously I know what it means but it would only affect him if he decided to be out publicly and I don't think that's going to happen but if we're talking in the sense of people knowing it in the form of a scandal it wouldn't affect him that much cent and Chinese artists operate way differently than korean artists they have way more freedom in the things they do and say some of many famous Chinese artists have had CRAZY crazy scandals over the years and they still continue to thrive now idk if hao will ever become super popular like yibo or something but he definitely could keep his current trajectory going</p>
