    "question": "Tbh everything will depend on the choreography. SinB did Tap in when it was a really popular song and the choreography was lackluster so it didn't pull big numbers. Yeonjun did watermelon sugar and the choreo was also boring so he didn't gather big numbers and even Wooyoung who is even less popular and did a non popular song got more views bc his choreo was more interesting.",
