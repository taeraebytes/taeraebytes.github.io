o i finally found an actual tweet from wdgs because all I saw were seokryus complaining but no context.... well I got my own opinion and before I start let me just say fuck jiwoong but lowkey true tho 😭 like ppusamz was mia all this time but then we got back to back updates 2 business days straight soft launching ppusamz and as much as we hate jiwoong he did get really good engagement for his blond hair... matt be scheming a bit 🤔</p>

      <p>no it's just cuz they're in japan lol they were back tgthr for March and I mean I don't blame Matthew for not interacting with him not just cuz of the scandal but jiwoong literally distanced himself and stopped ppusamz himself it wasn't Matthew so he just moved on the duo was only remnants of their fake bp onscreen clout ship a few months into zb1 anyways
