      <p>Do you think what happened with soobin & taehyun is the reason why txt have less hype their contract will end soon & can't predict what will happen to them but sometime i feel people are hyped about enh more than them the same situation as itzy disappearing from kpop radar & although nmixx is also flopping but they're more talked about generally</p>

      <p>Nah soobin didn't get any hit from that situation, it got forgotten after like 2 days because of seunghan and taehyun didnt get any hit as well, his fans didnt protest only the trolls make fun of it. They still chart like they usually do. And album sales havent decreased. Internationally too, enha have way more album sales this time but txt had more streams on the first day and recently they been popping off with jnetz since they started properly promoting there</p>
