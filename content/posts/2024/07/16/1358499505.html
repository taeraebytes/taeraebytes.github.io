      <p>I think if I let you guys apply with burners I'd have to like seriously make everything 10x harder like I'm doing it for my own peace of mind I can't have no name accounts slip through the cracks when it's supposed to be a private thing it's for everyone's safety honestly. But I get it I'll try to make the interrogation even harder like reallllyyy hard I hope yall have good memory
