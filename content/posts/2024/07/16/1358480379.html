      <p>no not my eyebrows but my hair ðŸ˜­ I have my hair up in a bun so on break I let it down and ig I have a subconscious habit of reading and touching my hair, my hair is naturally wavy but for some reason there's some strands that are extra squiggly so I pull them out ðŸ’€ didn't even know trichotillomania was a thing</p>

      <p>I think anon might have ocd instead because it seems like you're specifically only plucking out the hair that feels different from your normal hair</p>
