      <p>bruh i love zb1 so much like when i love a group i love hard but at the same time it feels so awks bc when loving a group the case is usually that the group feels so united and that's part of why u love them yk? and yeah zb1 are p close but then there's jw who's literally so different to all of them like his lack of connection to the group really sticks out like a sore thumb 😒 i was watching the music core jpn zepisode and it's always the same in every video u have all the members having fun with each other (in this one it's rk gv yj gw hb tr + mt zh + other variations between all these members) and then u have jw just doing shit on his own in every single video with no talking to the others like omg it pisses me off bc it's not gonna change atp, we're long gone, like if he lived at the dorm or even tried to talk to the members - idk what this man does - then everything would be so much better it's times like this when i wonder what they think of him 😭 i just hate the awkwardness bc i love the group and i've never stanned a group where one member is the odd one out while everyone else is so tight</p>

      <p>I barely consider him a member of the group ngl like when I see the 8 of them interact and it looks genuine and fun im happy because jiwoong just won't ever try. Like how are we even supposed to slightly like him if he's never tried the times he does interact and makes an effort are cool and all but like damn why is it once in a blue moon😭.... like to me im fine because I prefer it this way but what is jiwoong thinking being a lone wolf and also do they just accept it or try to bring him closer it's hella weird. I think we still have our family group jiwoongs just the weird uncle ig

      <p>it's kinda weird now often the members try to initiate stuff with him but if jw initiates interactions it's just weird attempts at yaoi fanservice like</p>
