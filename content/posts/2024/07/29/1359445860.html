 I think people are misunderstanding because he’s not saying Yujin did cry he’s saying when Yujin cries (as in generally) still at least people are clocking more how much fans have been ignoring him during their LA trip because I went to the dfesta event and so many just simply didn’t look at him or acknowledge him 😭</p>
