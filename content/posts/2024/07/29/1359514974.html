 they are so cute. I really like how with Hanbin, it is always him babying the members and not just trying to do some yaoi service</p>

      <p>I feel like people just put an emphasis on yaoi service or just interpret everything as that I really see most of the group interactions as friendship but it's cute how hanbin babys him WE NEEDED THAT

      <p>As an allin let me tell you, he acts like everything in this world is cute. He recently called a bug cute and drew ribbons on its head. But gunwook's cheeks are really cute though, he doesn't squish other members cheeks as much.</p>

      <p>I feel like he has an extra soft spot for Gunwook because he’s the same age as his younger sister like he’s the member he talks about on plus chat the most I’d say and they have a lot of duo selfies too especially recently.</p>

      <p>I remember during bp he voted for gyuvin to be the better en garde center when there was an evaluation when it was so clear to everyone Gunwook did better. He likes Gyuvin a lot more.</p>
