      <p>You know what after today i realized i'm gonna need wakeone to start giving gunwook more chances to showcase his vocals, like why did i see many allins trying to shade him and saying hanbin is up there with taerae and hao like he's miles better than him? and their argument is "he's given this part" like that doesnt mean anything they can't even argue about technique because they're both at about the same level and gunwook is so much more versatile, he struggles with stability sometimes but other than that. yeah don't ever play his face about vocals</p>

      <p>hanbin fans die about discrediting gunwooks vocals it's crazy they want to prop him up on the haorae level so bad but it's just not gonna happen most people rank him very very close to gunwook rather than those two and they just don't like it. It's so irksome like just give gunwook 6 months of vocal lessons AND ITS UP HOE üòí

      <p>You all want to fight us so bad huh!!! All this vocal conversation wouldn't have started if that one idiot on twitter didn't say hanbin didn't deserve the only line he got. It wasn't like we started shit unprovoked. And no one even dragged gunwook or other members as far as remember. Stop trying to create a fanwar here.</p>
