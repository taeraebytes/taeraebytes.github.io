      <p>æœ´ä¹¾æ—­ is confirmed now but ig chinese fans werent sure about the last character æ—­ or ç…œ because ìš± is used for both characters in hanguel so it really depends on the meaning

æ—­ rising sun / sun rise
ç…œ brilliant</p>

      <p>ohhhhhh ok yea it's the last character that's diff and I think he mentioned the meaning of his name in hanja last yr it was smth like the the shining morning sun I forget so yea the first character makes sense. I wonder if that fucks anything up cuz I usually see the second character used more
