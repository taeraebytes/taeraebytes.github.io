almost 3M views with just 3k+$, this explains perfectly why the video didn't trend, aside from the likes that dont match these are the views bought just from one fanbase, who knows how many from rich individuals and also cbar and other fanbases bought, icb allins tried to bullshit us with the "only 400k views" when this is coming  from their own fanbase, lmao</p>

      <p>Read the post, it says that views aren't counted unless someone watches more than 30s, and everyone bought ads, not only on YouTube but on multiple social media, saying that we bought views is not accurate.</p>
