 they are so cute. I really like how with Hanbin, it is always him babying the members and not just trying to do some yaoi service</p>

      <p>I feel like people just put an emphasis on yaoi service or just interpret everything as that I really see most of the group interactions as friendship but it's cute how hanbin babys him WE NEEDED THAT

      <p>As an allin let me tell you, he acts like everything in this world is cute. He recently called a bug cute and drew ribbons on its head. But gunwook's cheeks are really cute though, he doesn't squish other members cheeks as much.</p>
