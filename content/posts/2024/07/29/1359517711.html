Most people try to stand around the area where they enter the stage or wait rather than right in front of them ngl. I recommend standing where ur bias usually is in formation also and hmmm I literally just asked to move up cuz I was near a bunch of ateez fans and they let me that's all the tips I have tho\n\nI'm sure things would turn out diff for an actual concert but in general both kcon and concerts they announce when queuing starts for ga and camping is never officially recognized so it's a matter of just coming to queue check in early camping does nothing but potentially reserved a spot"
