      <p>I think it's just that people know the audition signifies that there's a show coming

      <p>Fun fact they initially opened up the auditions for individual trainees in 2021 but then they scrapped it and it opened up auditions again in July 2022 for trainees with agencies so they were planning to make the group permanent in the beginning but something changed along the way</p>

      <p>I think the trainee crop just wasn't good enough so they had to open it up to agency trainees
