      <p>2 days 😭?????????????????????????? wow... I forget this is like a public thing lol. well there's a lot of cc history and context ur missing idek how to start.. I mean read my rentry if you haven't and also my cc is completely separate from zerosetwt I myself got ran off and had a plethora of expose threads on me and I've been labeled an anti and an akgae even tho I'm not but it's an entirely separate community whatever happens on there does not happen here we are smart young class individuals with brains that use logic. Sorry I have no clue what else to say I'm just kind of shocked ur this new uhmmmmm how'd u find my cc?

      <p>oh really LOOL from the two days I been here idk u seem very un biased as in you talk about every member equally which I liked and stayed for, same with your anons 😭 

and umm I don't want to expose my moots but whatever HI YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE and basically we were on discord watching kcon together and one of my oomf was laughing so I was like what are you laughing at and she sent me your cc because an anon was complaining and already analyzing their dance relay they did as soon as it was over and then your anons jumped them for ruining the mood LOOOOL but yeah I'm sorry I didn't mean it I really like your cc and how unbiased it is ❤️</p>
