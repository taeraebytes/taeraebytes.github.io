      <p>I need ppl to understand that the reason why most intl fans don't care for yujin ins't because he's a minor but bc he's boring! sure, kfans and cfans love him but that's cuz they prioritize visuals, and as we have seen from the mic discourse they don't care for his personality. he isn't a particularly good singer or dancer or an entertainer. his maknae status is the only thing he has going on for him but he doesn't really harp in on it like other idols do (ex: eunchae) so there's nothing for people to attach themselves to. that's why when intl fans praise him they usually mention his age or relations to other members. he is BORING. and the reason why he is the most "neutral" member that people don't hate nor love, is because he is.... just there.</p>
