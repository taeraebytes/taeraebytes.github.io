      <p>2 days 😭?????????????????????????? wow... I forget this is like a public thing lol. well there's a lot of cc history and context ur missing idek how to start.. I mean read my rentry if you haven't and also my cc is completely separate from zerosetwt I myself got ran off and had a plethora of expose threads on me and I've been labeled an anti and an akgae even tho I'm not but it's an entirely separate community whatever happens on there does not happen here we are smart young class individuals with brains that use logic. Sorry I have no clue what else to say I'm just kind of shocked ur this new uhmmmmm how'd u find my cc?

      <p>Reading this cc thread is so cute T_T I love new anons esp the ones where it's moots linking it to them for funsies and not akgaes linking to other akgaes because we said Hao doesn't need to be in center position all the time 😭 Funny thing is I think most anons got introduced to this cc because of the latter option tho XDDD me included 🙋‍♀️ Came into this a solo borderline akgae to OT8 I'm so proud of myself</p>
