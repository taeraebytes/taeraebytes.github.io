      <p>zb1â€™s biggest mistake was choosing the hardest song of rv like the whole chorus was empty no harmonisation sorry hao even missed a beat of last chorus it looked so mid rv always takes turn in chorus and the performance formation is pretty wakeone always play safe giving hao the most and other the least. taerae is such beautiful singer we barely hear him. ricky was given a highnote that should have been done by taerae. the chorus looked so crack. Zb1 didnâ€™t even harmonise at all they left out many empty space no harmonisation adlibs hanbin did the prechorus that was prolly the hardest part of the cover</p>
