      <p>yeah after that psycho performance i’m not optimistic about the stage for their comeback 🤦‍♀️ it wasn’t bad but they played it wayyy too safe. Nothing to smile about when i comes to this group sometimes still love them though but man…already a rocky start to this era. Just hope another sweat situation doesn’t happen they they keep the amount of jiwoong lines and screentime to a minimum</p>
