 . Itâ€™s not totally unexpected but it just seems like a friendly sunbae hoobae relationship, Iâ€™d say heâ€™s probably more closer to yeonjun which was more unexpected because he mentioned they were going  to go out to dinner and dance together and they always hug when they see eachother and yj mentioned him as one of his friends in a fansign to me that friendship was a little more unexpected</p>
