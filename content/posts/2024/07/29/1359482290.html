      <p>it's the trauma after the whole bubble live incident where he got all his sns privileges taken away for like 8 months so i get it but it's gets soooo fucking annoying. but yeah anyways anon is right like ricky is literally known for taking his time when posting pics and you can tell he puts a lot of thought behind them including his captions like if anything hes most likely enjoying la with the members and meeting up with family and friends when they get free time like let my man live a little ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I mean that's what they think Ricky just doesn't post often he did not have an sns ban for 8 months ðŸ˜­ but fans will always demand content more often than not these people have completely far off ideas of who these idols are it's pretty obvious how Ricky operates and I'm like positive he'll post eventually he loves la so much

      <p>no but the narrative they spread about bans and not being able to post or be active is not helping ricky in any way ðŸ˜­ like you said that's just how he operates and it's totally fine imo i think it's better for fans to accept that instead of creating this narrative that will backfire eventually</p>

      <p>yea if they already think Ricky's been banned from the internet for 8 months they'll assume he's being locked up and not allowed to post lmaooaooo I don't think they'll ever accept it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>personally i doubt he was banned but he was definitely restricted in a way after he got yelled at on live like it's not normal that he just randomly started getting even more inactive than the usual after that whole thing but at the end of the day no one really knows and its better not to do mental gymnastics about it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
