 I think people are misunderstanding because heâ€™s not saying Yujin did cry heâ€™s saying when Yujin cries (as in generally) still at least people are clocking more how much fans have been ignoring him during their LA trip because I went to the dfesta event and so many just simply didnâ€™t look at him or acknowledge him ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>yea I don't think he's talking about yujin crying rn I can imagine how sad it must be to see him cry tho like he never cries but I saw the dfesta vids they were making me sad like wow this is the baby goat come correct
