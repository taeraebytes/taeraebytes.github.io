      <p>seeing them irl once and having interactions with them really gets you addicted wow i saw this one xhs post with long ass caption from a hao fan saying it’s probably better if she didn’t see him ever cause now she can’t get contented and she just needs to go on every show and she is super pretty too damn i get those fansites wanting to see them on every stop</p>
