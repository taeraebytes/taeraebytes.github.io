ok i tried to figure out who went with who since everyone thought it was just mattwoong that went together but im sick and my head hurts so i gave up 

so im just gonna assume it was mattwoongrae for the 1st set of pics and gunrae for the 2nd set (which means taerae chose to leave jiwoong out of his caption ?)

or mattrae for the 1st set then gunrae for the 2nd set and jiwoong was never even with matthew meaning seokryudans and jiwoong fans fought for no reason

yeah idk obviously thereâ€™s so many other scenarios that couldâ€™ve been the case but i refuse to do any more thinking</p>
