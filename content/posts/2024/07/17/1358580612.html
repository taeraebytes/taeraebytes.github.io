      <p>With the way every single one of his dancer friends involved are hyping him and promoting his aotm in more inclined to believe they worked with him because they know eachother and not for money. Not saying they did it for free but I doubt they got paid as much as your making out.</p>

      <p>Icl though I saw the list too and I think heâ€™s someone thatâ€™s made really good connections because of his dance background like even people who werenâ€™t involved like howl were hyping it. It seems like not a big thing to be friends with all these people at first but actually seeing the aotm rollout I realise now how much these friendships and connections can help someone in the right situations.</p>

      <p>Heâ€™s got way more than I thought and heâ€™s definitely super close to a lot of them like spella called him her baby/ son on her insta today so heâ€™s not as disconnected as I used to think he was like heâ€™s really close to these dancer circles. Now if he could just get us a good choreographer ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I mean it got spella to choreo the geoniehanie iconic dance duo so they definitely could ask him for some favours if they had any brains ðŸ˜­</p>
