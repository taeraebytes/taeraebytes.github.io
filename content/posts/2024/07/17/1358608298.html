      <p>i was gonna say this in lotus cc in reply to an anon but i didn't wanna deal with briize and i feel like this doesn't apply just to that one person but ppl in fandoms in general so i'm ranting here if u don't mind but i feel like sometimes nonfans are more obsessed with zb1's sexualities than some zerose like the way that some of them talk about this shit.... there is definitely criticism to be made about how ppl discuss sexuality and focus on it in the fandom but the way some ppl word this shit makes them also sound kinda homophobic in a different way to zerose. like they can never treat gay ppl normally it's always "hahaha they think the entire group is gays and they only care about who's fucking each other at the dorms while our group personality isn't like that" rather than "why do they make such a spectacle of the possibility of these idols being gay, that's pretty inappropriate considering korea's whole sociopolitical situation" and then i'm sure taking part in typical twitter fanwars consisting of calling them f words or twinks to drag the group just bc the fandom does quite a bit of shipping like there's just a certain bad vibe i get from it idk</p>

      <p>it‚Äôs blatant homophobia let‚Äôs just call a spade a spade i know you have very strong opinions abt their sexualities and annoyance of them being called gay by zeroes but regardless of that the insults they get thrown at them are rooted in homophobia and it‚Äôs so sinister to me because it‚Äôs so normalized it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre going backwards. like when that one person called jiwoong the f slur i remember ppl on this cc being so dismissive about it saying that zeroses shouldn‚Äôt be surprised because they call them gay all the time or some shit but still it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is literal blatant homophobia and it‚Äôs not just a briize-zerose issue it‚Äôs a general kpop issue the amount of normalized homophobic rhetoric i see towards idols is insane and it hardly gets called out and the worst part that it‚Äôs frequently perpetuated by other queer ppl under the protection of ‚Äúi‚Äôm queer i could never be homophobic ü§™‚Äù</p>

      <p>Well obviously it's homophobia why else would that be used as a diss regardless of my opinions I'm awareüò≠ yea it's always been a general thing for stan twt not just inside this specific fandom war it's not even just briizes who say it about the group it's sad but I wasn't trying to be dismissive about that jiwoong thing I just didn't really care ab that in particular in general I stay away from all that on purpose there's just things that won't change ab twitter

      <p>To op there's a general move towards conservatism in culture this is why you see people being accepting of homophobia, slurs, tradfem content, americana and cowboy aesthetics etc</p>
