he literally booked SMâ€™s performance director for his AOTM. Like jrickbaek mostly works SM performance like riize nct kai exo aespa. Hanbin casually booking jrick for the aotm and jrick is hyping him like they are so close. We need wakeone to milk his connection get a good choreography for us</p>

      <p>itâ€™s cuz jrickbaek isnâ€™t an employee at sm nor does he have an exclusive contract with themâ€¦ he just does freelance work so if wake one offered him a good amount of money to work with hanbin he wouldnâ€™t decline nor would he decline to work with zb1</p>
