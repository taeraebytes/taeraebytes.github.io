      <p>i was gonna say this in lotus cc in reply to an anon but i didn't wanna deal with briize and i feel like this doesn't apply just to that one person but ppl in fandoms in general so i'm ranting here if u don't mind but i feel like sometimes nonfans are more obsessed with zb1's sexualities than some zerose like the way that some of them talk about this shit.... there is definitely criticism to be made about how ppl discuss sexuality and focus on it in the fandom but the way some ppl word this shit makes them also sound kinda homophobic in a different way to zerose. like they can never treat gay ppl normally it's always "hahaha they think the entire group is gays and they only care about who's fucking each other at the dorms while our group personality isn't like that" rather than "why do they make such a spectacle of the possibility of these idols being gay, that's pretty inappropriate considering korea's whole sociopolitical situation" and then i'm sure taking part in typical twitter fanwars consisting of calling them f words or twinks to drag the group just bc the fandom does quite a bit of shipping like there's just a certain bad vibe i get from it idk</p>
