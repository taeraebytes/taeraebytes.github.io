      <p>It's not just about the sea thing which is important but like why and for what does a solo lightstick need to be sold for the groups very first tour.. like wow we're actually the most cooked fandom ever ðŸ˜­ if you can't see the issue with that I can't help you

      <p>I agree with Requeef like if you canâ€™t see the issue with having a solo member fanlight when the group has an official one is crazy. Especially since this isnâ€™t an event with loads of groups this is for zb1 concerts, itâ€™s not about demand or not because trust we know solo rosins would rather use the yellow one itâ€™s the fact youâ€™d rather pull up to a zb1 concert with a lightstick hao has never and probably will never acknowledge like Iâ€™m being serious in saying heâ€™s probably like seeing all the zerose light sticks more</p>
