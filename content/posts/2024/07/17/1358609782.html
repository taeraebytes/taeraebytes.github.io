      <p>😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 being based in reality might save everyone a lot of trouble when I first heard about the nomination the one and only thing I thought wakeone might acknowledge is if he won but that's a maybe like they've failed to acknowledge so many things and a solo award is definitely not up on their list
