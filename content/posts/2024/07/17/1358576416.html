      <p>i know you dont care but its odd how we still dont have any idea kep1er’s contract extension is for and UNRELATED but i still dont get what is stopping these companies from giving their temp groups the x1 contract.. like 2 years exclusive contract then 5 years non exclusive contract or whatever it was like im sorry but thats ideal for everyone???? like imagine two years of gathering fame for the jebes and then letting the members go back to their own companies to do whatever but then come back for a jebe comeback like once a year EVERYONE WINS? the members keep the group momentum and name and they can still promote with their original companies. IM SEEING DOLLAR SIGNS these companies are so stupid</p>
