      <p>Someone said maybe they thought fans were mad about them not promoting votings in general so they finally posted one but missed the mark completely 😭</p>

      <p>😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 being based in reality might save everyone a lot of trouble when I first heard about the nomination the one and only thing I thought wakeone might acknowledge is if he won but that's a maybe like they've failed to acknowledge so many things and a solo award is definitely not up on their list

      <p>This is funny because one of the screenshots rosins bring up to show other groups accounts promoting voting is shinees account promoting the popular icon award which hanbin was also eligible to be nominated for but wakeone never posted so like not only did you try and make a hypothetical situation to get mad at your also wrong because they could have promoted hanbin for the 3 categories he was eligible to be nominated for like other groups did if they wanted to … but they didn’t. Like how do you guys bring hanbin into everything, this has nothing to do with him and yall still wanna find something to be mad at him over 😭</p>

      <p>lmao no way 😭 see I'll never understand this like what does hanbin have to do with this that's where credibility becomes lost to me because it's almost like a driving force for outrage isn't even about the issues at hand it's just a competition

 like you can’t make this up of all these screenshots only 2 are about ost’s the rest are about the candidates that are eligible to be nominated I mean one of them is literally rookie entertainer which is what hanbin was eligible for too. Hao’s award was completely through fan voting on an app 6 of these screenshots are about the website where they wanted fans to vote for candidates out of the list of eligible idols/actors. I completely sympathise that wakeone should have promoted voting and tried their best to let him attend but I’m so sick of them saying “BUT IF IT WAS HANBIN” like ok well now I’m showing you with your own proof they could have done it for hanbin had they wanted to but they didn’t. They do this with everything like for some reasons all hao’s mistreatments would have never happened if it was hanbin but it’s always a hypothetical situation that never happens and ends up with hanbin catching it for no reason at all.</p>

      <p>Clock it again for me like I get it I get the outrage but why does it always take a turn at something imaginary like it always comes back to this stupid year long fanwar please move on and try something else
