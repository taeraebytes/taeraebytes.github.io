      <p>hao just said he can’t go bdsa because of flight issue Oh I just checked there’s no midnight flight from seoul to macau and even the last flight is around 9:55pm and the next day flight is around 11am it takes 4 hours to reach the destination. And bdsa starts at 8:30pm and the flight schedule couldn’t get in synced at all</p>
