      <p>wow I'm rewriting this a second time and it's actually so hard I feel like I have to put everything I've ever said in the last year into one but also write more than one sentence ab the members idc about fuckkkkkkk

jiwoong- not wasting my words on him very clear in what my opinion is about him I feel like 

taerae- still a little bit of a weird guy to me I just find him so not regular and the things he does sometimes is so funny to me half of it comes across as an act I've only recently warmed up to him but he's aight I do feel bad ab his fans abusing him a different me would've said he deserved it but hey

Hanbin- used to be the literal devil in my eyes but I healed and he's just so ermmm idk himself I guess I find him a lot less calculating but that's also just cuz he's opening up I guess he still comes off grandma-like to me but maybe that's good. Hmmm idk what else to say hes still insecure but im surprised at how he's been taking way more notice to his fans could be good thing could be a bad thing 

Hao- used to be my goat fans can rlly ruin someone for u he seems pretty free and sure of himself though sometimes I can find the whole babying him thing weird he's cool tho. Something kinda seems different about him it's not like I'm paying less attention to him than before but idk what it is hmmm idk what else to say oh I can def appreciate his role in the group no matter what he's an eccentric for sure too

Matty- my Canadian goattt wow i find him so cute it's crazy but he feels like someone familiar idc if he's cringe and didn't have internet for 2 years and embarrasses himself bfnenckdkfkkf ok lemme stop yea he's like a friend and it's very easy to enjoy him and even tho I never stan english speaking idols I always have to like them by default it's in my blood to. He knows his strengths and I feel like he's smart about it so that's just a plus. Is this even a brutal opinion... I kinda don't know what to say welll I think he has 0 future prospects tbh good luck to him post 2026 ðŸ˜­
