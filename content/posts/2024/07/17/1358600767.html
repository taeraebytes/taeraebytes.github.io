he literally booked SMâ€™s performance director for his AOTM. Like jrickbaek mostly works SM performance like riize nct kai exo aespa. Hanbin casually booking jrick for the aotm and jrick is hyping him like they are so close. We need wakeone to milk his connection get a good choreography for us</p>
