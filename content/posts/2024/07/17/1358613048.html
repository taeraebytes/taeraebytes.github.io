      <p>Wait it was from a fs repo and someone asked him to label who is who in the family. He said hanbin is the dad, hao is the mom and Gyuvin is the friend. There were only 4 slots (1 was pet but he Xed it) but yeah they were tweaking because a lot of them try and insert jiwoong into a trio with hao and yujin and make that â€˜Familyzâ€™ even though itâ€™s always been hanbin hao and yujin ðŸ˜‚</p>
