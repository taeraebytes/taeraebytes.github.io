he literally booked SMâ€™s performance director for his AOTM. Like jrickbaek mostly works SM performance like riize nct kai exo aespa. Hanbin casually booking jrick for the aotm and jrick is hyping him like they are so close. We need wakeone to milk his connection get a good choreography for us</p>

      <p>itâ€™s cuz jrickbaek isnâ€™t an employee at sm nor does he have an exclusive contract with themâ€¦ he just does freelance work so if wake one offered him a good amount of money to work with hanbin he wouldnâ€™t decline nor would he decline to work with zb1</p>

      <p>Heâ€™s not an employee at sm but he technically was the performance director for ALOT of their stuff he probably knows hanbin through bada because i swear they worked on taemins guilty choreo. I donâ€™t think wakeone would have to pay him an extortionate amount to get him to work on aotm if heâ€™s already close with hanbin and is working on it with bada who heâ€™s already worked with a lot before.</p>

      <p>Probably yea it didn't take much to get him to work on the aotm but to get him to do official work for the group that's definitely harder
