ok i tried to figure out who went with who since everyone thought it was just mattwoong that went together but im sick and my head hurts so i gave up 

so im just gonna assume it was mattwoongrae for the 1st set of pics and gunrae for the 2nd set (which means taerae chose to leave jiwoong out of his caption ?)

or mattrae for the 1st set then gunrae for the 2nd set and jiwoong was never even with matthew meaning seokryudans and jiwoong fans fought for no reason

yeah idk obviously thereâ€™s so many other scenarios that couldâ€™ve been the case but i refuse to do any more thinking</p>

      <p>I investigated this earlier but I fell asleep before sending it but gunwook also just posted pics of him with an umbrella so I feel like this is correct

I looked at the exact area where they took the pics on google maps and theyâ€™re 1000% lying about the first walk LOL 
they just stopped at a 7-Eleven right next to the highway on the way to the hotel and took some pics outside. itâ€™s probably the same place where gunwook and hanbin took their ig pics too but they did it inside

Itâ€™s really obvious that they didnâ€™t walk there because there are literally 0 hotels in that area like itâ€™s next to a sewage treatment plant and a power grid substation. All the hotels are clustered in another area much further down the highway 

So the first walk was tr mttw jw but it was just a 30 second walk from the 7 Eleven parking lot to the street 

and I think the second walk in the rain was probably just taerae and gunwook alone. it looks like gw took the pics they look similar to the one he took of him in Belgium
itâ€™s not impossible for Matthew to also have been there I guess but the logistics of 3 people taking a walk together in the rain with 1 umbrella Each just seems way too awkward to be worth it like I canâ€™t see it in my head like how do you walk on the street as a group of 3 umbrella havers. so Iâ€™m guessing they went on a walk alone 

I have a lot to say about this and other related things but this is already very long and I canâ€™t even say everything here LOL but yeah the first one never happened they cooked that doodoo in 2 minutes outside of a 7-eleven right next to a sewage plant and ppusamzers happily ate it thinking they went on a romantic night walk</p>

      <p>yea this just further confirms it's two separate "walks" but I'm really curious as to how you figured out where they were maybe cuz I can't read Japanese the signs don't do anything for me but wait now you've actually piqued my interest please say the rest. And this would mean taerae definitely left out jiwoong from the caption ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>isn't it the staff that captions their instagram posts???? idk they feel less personal and are usually just in english which i can't see lots of the members doing (except strangely sometimes matthew's feel more personal so idk what's up with that). a bit funny either way tho bc then that'd mean it's the staff leaving him out which probably wouldn't be intentional but ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I think more often than not the members caption it themselves since I've seen a bunch of personalized messages but igs diff than twt u gotta keep it short and sweet but it could be staff as well but yea funny either way jiwoong got left out lolllllll
