      <p>they did not ask the award show staff about that tho? they asked if the award will still be given regardless of the attendance bc there’s instances that these award shows give awards only to those in attendance. the confirmation of hao’s attendance was emailed to w1 only</p>

      <p>oh is that what they asked? I feel like if that was the case then hao would've went to the award show plus it's not even common for idols to attend for the category even if they win so they most likely get it still

      <p>pretty sure for an award that is 100% fan voted they will give it to whoever has the most votes no matter their attendance</p>
