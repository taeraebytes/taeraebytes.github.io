      <p>It's not just about the sea thing which is important but like why and for what does a solo lightstick need to be sold for the groups very first tour.. like wow we're actually the most cooked fandom ever ðŸ˜­ if you can't see the issue with that I can't help you

      <p>When exo did concerts their cfans would do the same and it was hell, I remember a concert on where there was a big ass section that only had Sehun light stick and it was awkward as hell and exo-ls and Sehun akgaes were killing each other for it ðŸ˜­</p>
