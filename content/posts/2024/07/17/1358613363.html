      <p>He literally told them don't be angry and tried to joke around, he directly asked for positive energy and they don't care, honestly sorry for being sad but I feel bad that he just lost all his bite and combative spirit like so much negativity around him recently about EVERYTHING he does it really changed himðŸ¤§I really hope he lets the phone go</p>
