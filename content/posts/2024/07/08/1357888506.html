      <p>Hanbin usually sings in his head voice, if you remember they highlighted this in the bp audition too and his head voice is pretty good actually let‚Äôs see if he can transition smoothly</p>

      <p>This is not me but it's not a dunk I've said it here before but that's like genuine advice to gunwook to not try vocal parts that he's not well equipped with all the time because that leads to vocal damage and regression in the future that is also one of the reasons hanbin is ranked slightly higher than gunwook in vocalist rankings</p>

      <p>yea I know he's barely had any vocal training but he's started lessons so I'm glad he's taking singing more serious
