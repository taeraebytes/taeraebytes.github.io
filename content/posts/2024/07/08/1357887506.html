      <p>Yeah I feel like this was well known because in the vlog his friends posted from his uni like right after the finale that had to get deleted he was driving them in a 2023 electric Hyundai and I remember everyone saying how nice the car was because it had one of those wrap around touch screen dashboards and cost like $50,000+. It wouldnâ€™t make sense for that to be a rental because whose renting a car that nice in the first place just to go to uni and his uni is so far out from Seoul</p>
