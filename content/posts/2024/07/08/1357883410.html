      <p>psycho is one of my least fav red velvet songs as well but it is also one of their most well known despite the lack of promo. It really couldâ€™ve been their signature song if the wendy incident didnâ€™t happen. I can definitely see the performance go viral. It could also be a potential concept they could pull off for one of their comebacks</p>
