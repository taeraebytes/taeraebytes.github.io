      <p>I think that another issue is that some of them keep getting too swayed away by what their fans say. Like you can see that Hanbin and Hao doesn't mention the members that much on lives  bc of akgaes and only talk about themselves. While Gyuvin will only talk about the members that benefit him. Like drop that shit and start speaking about things that happen on the dorms, practices, etc. We don't want to know what you ate yesterday or what movie did you watch that afternoon. We want to know what Matthew told you at practice or which places did you went to with the members.

I don't even stan txt anymore bc their music started to bore me but something about them is that those dudes talk a lot about group anecdotes during their lives and that made them so fun, it's one of the things that made me fall in love with them.</p>

      <p>It's just so disingenuous and sucks some of the fun out of the group like seriously the solo lives won't fucking matter in the slightest in a year group stuff always always trumps it always matters more it always has more impact like I hateeee it omg

      <p>I donâ€™t haves haoâ€™s subscription so I couldnâ€™t tell you who he speaks about a lot but hanbin does speak about members? Not a shit ton but mostly gyuvin Gunwook or Matthew and the lives these days are only hitting around 10 mins so itâ€™s not like they go hours and never mention a member.</p>

      <p>There's definitely been a shift for Hanbin tho with his first lives Vs how he operates now, he avoids talking about Hao like the plague obviously but even the other members he talks about a lot less in his last live he talked about myungjae and sohee more than any members in a while, I'm a hanbin defender on here but this is one thing I don't like about him cause I understand for Hao cause rosins will send him dt over anything but like there's some things about Matthew that rubbed me the wrong way cause he doesn't have a fandom and that's your long time friend</p>

      <p>Why are we lying he still talks about the members loadsðŸ˜­ his last live he was literally talking about Ricky and the glasses he got him and called him cute. Like most of his recent lives havenâ€™t been longer that 10-15 minutes how much do you want him to talk about the other members in that time ðŸ˜­</p>
