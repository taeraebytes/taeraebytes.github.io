      <p>Hanbin usually sings in his head voice, if you remember they highlighted this in the bp audition too and his head voice is pretty good actually let‚Äôs see if he can transition smoothly</p>

      <p>This is not me but it's not a dunk I've said it here before but that's like genuine advice to gunwook to not try vocal parts that he's not well equipped with all the time because that leads to vocal damage and regression in the future that is also one of the reasons hanbin is ranked slightly higher than gunwook in vocalist rankings</p>

      <p>yea I know he's barely had any vocal training but he's started lessons so I'm glad he's taking singing more serious

      <p>He hasn't regressed he was just overestimated he just hasn't shown an improvement like taerae has which is pretty normal for a vocalist at his levels it's very rare for people to improve from that level without extensive consistent levels the only person I can think of is taemin also the anon that said taemin used to be tone deaf here a few days ago was just loud and wrong he was always around gunwook/matthew levels and then improved</p>

      <p>this makes more sense I don't think he's gotten worse everyone seems like they've gotten better but exactly with the Taemin thing like I'm always confused how do u go from tone deaf to a great vocalist that makes no sense üò≠üò≠

and as for zb1 i would say only taerae yujin and gyuvin have shown improvement heavy on yujin and gyuvin because they were both underdeveloped vocalists but in the last year they have showed some levels of proper breath support especially yujin but he seems to be losing consistency again now it was noticable in the run run cover gyuvin only started showing his improvements around the run run era so I hope he keeps it up</p>
