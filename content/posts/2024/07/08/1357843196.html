      <p>Did u see sohee tweet outliked hanbinâ€™s tweet on bndâ€™s official acc even when hanbinâ€™s was posted 6 hours before his & was supposed to have more interactions. Soheeâ€™s popularity is no joke, he also ended bnd with that one tweet. Imagine the most liked tweet on your official acc is a member of another groupðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>It doesnâ€™t really suprise me though because zb1 have more solos and akgaes who arenâ€™t going to be liking individual tweets like that whereas I feel more briize would like the pic even if itâ€™s not their bias. I mean the interactions on the hanbin pic are more than any of the recent interactions on ZB1â€™s own page so Iâ€™m suprised it got as many likes as it did.</p>
