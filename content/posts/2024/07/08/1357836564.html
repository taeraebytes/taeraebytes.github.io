      <p>He got angel lighting from being unscathed from riizes plethora of monthly scandals, he has a cuter image from the group and he's the main vocal of the group he's so essential that you can't really hate on him if you like the group it's also riize getting popular that just automatically gives him positive attention. I honestly saw it coming but nobody likes his visuals still he's just been on good behavior and he's rising in popularity so they can kick it w him

      <p>The thing is that when you are not that good looking but still cute the best you can do is act loserish and that's what sohee has been doing and what taerae was supposed to keep doing.</p>

      <p>his personality isn't actually received the same domestically as internationally, sure now with like weekly idol and super lady he does appear more like hm how to say.. gay. even domestically but for the most part he's seen as a puppy like fan loving idol and kfans do like that personality a lot they liked it even back then on boys planet when it was only really seen during the dance practice lives</p>
