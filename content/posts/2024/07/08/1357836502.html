      <p>He got angel lighting from being unscathed from riizes plethora of monthly scandals, he has a cuter image from the group and he's the main vocal of the group he's so essential that you can't really hate on him if you like the group it's also riize getting popular that just automatically gives him positive attention. I honestly saw it coming but nobody likes his visuals still he's just been on good behavior and he's rising in popularity so they can kick it w him

      <p>sohee is from sm, in the most popular sm boy group (well we know why because it's sm) and has a shy introverted personality + savior complex fans that'd have never worked for tr lol but I do think it's good that tr doesn't put on some fake personality</p>
