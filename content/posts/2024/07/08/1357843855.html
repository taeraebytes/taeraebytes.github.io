      <p>they are upset bc fan accs can easily get 10k while the official posts even on weibo barely gets it and some are comparing it to hao and yujin‚Äôs engagements but ig most riyangis don‚Äôt even wanna interact with the official acc anymore but thats just stupid bc its important for feedback</p>
