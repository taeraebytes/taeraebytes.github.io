      <p>He got angel lighting from being unscathed from riizes plethora of monthly scandals, he has a cuter image from the group and he's the main vocal of the group he's so essential that you can't really hate on him if you like the group it's also riize getting popular that just automatically gives him positive attention. I honestly saw it coming but nobody likes his visuals still he's just been on good behavior and he's rising in popularity so they can kick it w him

      <p>i feel like if taerae was just a few cm taller and he had a quiet but quirky personality he could actually have been closer to sohee level its actually a shame</p>

      <p>Height doesn't mean much when both sohee and wonbin are his height it's just everything aligned for sohee taeraes in wakeone and tried the wrong personality

      <p>The thing is that when you are not that good looking but still cute the best you can do is act loserish and that's what sohee has been doing and what taerae was supposed to keep doing.</p>

      <p>"not that good looking" I'm sorry to say but 50% of why taerae debuted and never ranked below top 15 is because kfans ate up his visuals lol ifans used to complain about it all the time before he blew up with mil as a matter of fact I myself only discovered taerae because my moot used to call him talentless visual for several weeks JSKDKWKD</p>

      <p>Not that good looking â‰  ugly.

Taerae is not ugly but we know that Koreans don't gag over his visuals either like they do with other idols like idk Mingyu, Eunwoo or Jaehyun.

He's not ugly but he's not super handsome the same way that Sohee is. That's why I am saying that the loser charm can add a lot to those looks and that's also one of the reasons why Korean girlies liked him, but now that he left that image behind they don't go hard for him as much as they did during BP.</p>
