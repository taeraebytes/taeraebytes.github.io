      <p>I'm not gonna comment on how idols handle scrutiny everyone's different and the volume of it is unimaginable to us like whys it a bad thing he's sensitive to getting shat on and it's different to hao his big kfans don't complain ab his every move daily and criticize him or the fan he's been grateful to for a long time it messes with ur head
