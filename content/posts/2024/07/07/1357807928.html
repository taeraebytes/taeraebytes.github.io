      <p>at the beginning he was really doubling down on hate and didn't let it get to to him but you can tell by now that he's gotten exhausted of doing it which is why he's always sending those messages now it's ðŸ˜• I wish he could ignore those few annoying stans they aren't worth it</p>

      <p>it's definitely not the majority but probably a few yeah even recently some fans (?) or non fans cosplayed as taerae egg accounts to criticise his blonde hair someone made a whole thread about how he's selfies because he only ever does what he wants and doesn't listen to fans which is dumb as fuck he always listens to fans mind you he doesn't even wear colorful clothes anymore because some dumbass fans complained about it</p>
