      <p>I think that another issue is that some of them keep getting too swayed away by what their fans say. Like you can see that Hanbin and Hao doesn't mention the members that much on lives  bc of akgaes and only talk about themselves. While Gyuvin will only talk about the members that benefit him. Like drop that shit and start speaking about things that happen on the dorms, practices, etc. We don't want to know what you ate yesterday or what movie did you watch that afternoon. We want to know what Matthew told you at practice or which places did you went to with the members.

I don't even stan txt anymore bc their music started to bore me but something about them is that those dudes talk a lot about group anecdotes during their lives and that made them so fun, it's one of the things that made me fall in love with them.</p>

      <p>It's just so disingenuous and sucks some of the fun out of the group like seriously the solo lives won't fucking matter in the slightest in a year group stuff always always trumps it always matters more it always has more impact like I hateeee it omg

      <p>Well i don't blame hanbin and hao their akgaes are insane and will always try to start shit whenever they interact so them minimizing their mention of eo is unfortunate but understandable.</p>
