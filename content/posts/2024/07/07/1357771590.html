      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>What about the exposure the other members have been getting ? Or do you realise that’s not exactly how that works</p>

      <p>diff anon but what exposure they got to the gp? literally nothing they get ever compares to what hanbin gets og anon was probably exaggerating with that melon top20 but i think he should at least bring in fans and it reflects on the group's success like isnt that the whole argument allins had during sept/aug saying him getting more schedules was good for the group too if he gets promoted this much like why yall acting like it's a weird concept;g,b,g?</p>

      <p>first and foremost emka mcing is only helping hanbin himself even sohee and myungjae are only getting exposure for themselves it's part of the reason why sohees  image changed and myungjae remains the only member of bnd anybody knows so that's not helping us and outside of that there's not much else like sorry I've said it ALWAYS and I'll say it again solo promo does almost nothing for a group 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like we knew that alr

      <p>The only way to bring in more fans for the group is to actually promote them as a group, send them to shows as a group, say it’s the group or nothing. Like that’s why it’s ultimately working for bnd and riize because aside from their MCs in both groups they do everything as a group I don’t think there is any other solo schedules and for a group that isn’t even a year old zb1 has an insane amount of solo and unit work</p>

      <p>The korean fans always talk about wanting a group live. I think that would do good too. I have stanned many kpop idols but I never spend time watching their bbl or ig lives like I do with hanbin. I think the members in general are so good with the fans in live content.</p>

      <p>I love solo lives but whenever we get any pair or group lives even very professional and monitored ones like the Hao Ricky jiwoong hanbin one I prefer it sm cause members can actually bounce off of eo like no matter what you need that group dynamic</p>

      <p>it also just sucks because we don't have much time with the group left and there's barely anything to look back on group wise that's so sad like imagine wanting to reminisce the group AND ALL U HAVE IS SOLO LIVES WHERE THE MEMBERS INTERACT W THE CHAT HALF THE TIME🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

      <p>Also don't kill me but some of those duos that wakeone likes to push for lives and self produced content don't even have that much chemistry or fun in them. Like Luckyz is boring, Woonghao are awkward as hell no matter how much time has passed, yujin x gyuvin is boring as hell too.</p>
