      <p>Did u see sohee tweet outliked hanbinâ€™s tweet on bndâ€™s official acc even when hanbinâ€™s was posted 6 hours before his & was supposed to have more interactions. Soheeâ€™s popularity is no joke, he also ended bnd with that one tweet. Imagine the most liked tweet on your official acc is a member of another groupðŸ˜­</p>
