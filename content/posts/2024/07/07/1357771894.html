      <p>Hanbin lost the most tbh. He was crazy popular in korea once. I am a predebut allin and his kfandom has been decreasing in size with time. it was always concerning for me. And I really hate those solo iallins who think he is doing well in korea and set him up against rosins. Like no, I don't think they were there during bp. I remember all tweets getting thousands of likes in seconds and minutes when he went to visit his ads. Now he rarely gets 1k likes. And those viral tweets don't do him any good. I'm not bragging about one 10k likes tweet when he used to get multiple ones easily before. And for intl side, his biggest account shbcloud is no longer active, the other accounts like namubin are all blocked by haobinists.</p>

      <p>Shbpics is just a media account. Shbcloud used to post translations and all other cute fansign moments. Now Hanbin doesn't have an account like that.</p>

      <p>girl hill is a queen she know how those zeroses are so when people came at her for being rps she shut down the crazy tweets and stopped the delusional ones ðŸ˜­. and then her priv acc has less than 100 followers so zeroses won't come for them. she will stay strong</p>

      <p>Hill is haobinplanet not shbcloud! But yes she's super professional I'm glad she stopped addressing akgaes even if they literally always pathetically camp in her qrts to harass her like she's very pro and brings in engagement I like her</p>

haobinsplanet a haobin acc CHOP

Well ig its my seokryudan since she's a useful translation acc and does a decent amt of group tweeting but idk we need smth a bit more centered and im not gonna expect a translation acc to take on the load of doing group updating it's hard work
