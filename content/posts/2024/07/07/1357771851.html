      <p>Hanbin has said before that the best compliments that he could get were related to him loosing weight so yeah he's pretty much disordered which I kinda understand why, when people lose tons of weight and the skinny privilege starts hitting it makes them feel pretty good bc you keep receiving compliments and better treatment from people. So add that to the fact that he's on an industry on where the cameras are on him all the time and you are subject to the public opinion, on an industry on where visuals matter a lot...</p>

      <p>Like honestly one of the reasons why I felt bad for rosins coming at him when he said that comment it's bc i know that he actually needs help, he's on a bad mindset like this is not your typical kpop idol mindset of making fat jokes like Gyuvin for example, this is legit the mindset of a disordered person. Plus Hao is the same as him.</p>
