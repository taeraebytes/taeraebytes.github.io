      <p>no but jiwoong fans already boycotting so he might as well just leave bruv, him staying in the group only hinders us and if his fans aint contributing then wtf is the point of having him here? if he leave he doesnt have to keep reactivating and activating his damn ig just leave and let it stay active his fans will be happy and we will be happy</p>
