      <p>Nah like im desi and if he was doing it in a set up way that was actually done to mock south Asians then ofc id be pissed but him doing that move in a dance that wasnâ€™t mocking anything really means nothing to me. Iâ€™m not going to tell other south Asians they canâ€™t be mad but Iâ€™m really not going to tweak over this. Also I saw some people saying it was in or wasnâ€™t in the og choreo, I couldnâ€™t find the original video but in the video jaehyun did from school (which is where he was recreating it from) he did do a similar hand movement at the beginning.</p>

      <p>of course of course I'm not going to either but it's just so clear this isn't out of concern or even criticism it's straight up just fan war fuel for these people that's why I can never respect their outrage because it's not for desi culture and it's obvious
