      <p>i wonder how foreign idols even cope in korea you must want something so bad to stay in such environment cause i stayed in korea and it really opens your eyes to how rude some koreans can be as someone who travels a lot i’m so used to people being super polite to foreigners especially in asia but i’ve realized how unwelcoming korean people are and it’s so upsetting because the country itself is so pretty if it weren't for the people i would have stayed much longer</p>

      <p>obviously the dream is bigger for them to want to work as foreign celebs and it's also ur mindset like I'm used to feeling unwelcome in America and u just get used to it
