      <p>what are kallins opinions on 2binz? Idk why but I feel like they lowkey don't like the duo because Gyuvin is ruining Hanbin's perfect boy next door, cool highschool crush image because when they're together they always do goofy stuff</p>

      <p>They deffo donâ€™t like it but itâ€™s not like rosins and allins who fight and drag eachothers biases on main. Gyuvinist are kinda docile in regards to hanbin so freaking on gyuvin seems kinda mean to them so they do it in private.</p>
