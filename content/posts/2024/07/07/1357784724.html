      <p>"Hao biased borderline solo" this being the voices in your head anon and queef is a hanbin dickrider so we move. saying terrible people as if you lot arent just as bad girl the lack of self-awareness is crazy there are like 4 quotes max from rosin akgaes and the others are norma zeroses but ofc yalls obsession with rosins and blaming everything on them comes above everything</p>
