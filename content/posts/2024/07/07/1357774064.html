      <p>what we need this cb:
- relay dance
- mv reaction
- ot9 photoshoots/interviews
- mmtg
- more of9 schedules in general (idol radio would be good bc i personally like the radio schedules but sunwoo is a tweaker so then everyoneâ€™s satisfied)
- gunwook self written verse
- youngjiâ€™s show is apparently supposed to come back so if it comes back in time hao should go on bc heâ€™d be hilarious, itâ€™s a famous show, they already had that pic together so they probably get on idc if sheâ€™s annoying
- good choreo, concept pics and mv that are actually exciting
- casual ig lives tho they could already do that now ðŸ™„
- zbtv return but improved
- non-dance tiktoks to promote the songs which are actually GOOD mp/sweat/ftp ones were traumatising
- more cohesive album.. we donâ€™t need yhmah the re-up we need yits/mp 2.0
what else</p>
