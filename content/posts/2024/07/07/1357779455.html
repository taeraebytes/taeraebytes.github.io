      <p>Individual igs would be a massive blow to the ot9 space that is currently growing like wakeone need to be serious. The only flaw I find in this theory though is everytime he reactivates and people say maybe personal igs, hanbin has never reactivated his so itâ€™s gotta be something exclusive to him.</p>

      <p>Literally individual igs is the worst thing that could ever happen to us like even the thought of it makes me sick like nah we're not doing that and exactly if that were the case hanbins would come back
