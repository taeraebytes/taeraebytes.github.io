      <p>He got angel lighting from being unscathed from riizes plethora of monthly scandals, he has a cuter image from the group and he's the main vocal of the group he's so essential that you can't really hate on him if you like the group it's also riize getting popular that just automatically gives him positive attention. I honestly saw it coming but nobody likes his visuals still he's just been on good behavior and he's rising in popularity so they can kick it w him

      <p>The thing is that when you are not that good looking but still cute the best you can do is act loserish and that's what sohee has been doing and what taerae was supposed to keep doing.</p>
