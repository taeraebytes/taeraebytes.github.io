    "question": "Hey girl im a black hijabi i lived there in 2019 working for a year in daegu, but last two months in seoul. I agree it feels initimdating at first, I grew up in a very diverse part of the UK so u do have to get used to ur identity coming before you in all types of life. Like at work i was just the hijabi girl i fought so hard to just be seen as a normal worker, cute at first bc of the attention but nobody takes u serious and it was hard to make connections in somewhere as small as daegu. But if you are extroverted and try to make conversation esp with old ppl u can have a good time even if it means whipping out google translate. Its the young ppl who will avoid u like the plague, not racism but just straight up dont want to make friends with foreigners bc of language barrier which i get. But if ur holidaying in seoul just take advantage of ur foreigner status do fun and crazy stuff for sure",

      <p>i wonder how foreign idols even cope in korea you must want something so bad to stay in such environment cause i stayed in korea and it really opens your eyes to how rude some koreans can be as someone who travels a lot i‚Äôm so used to people being super polite to foreigners especially in asia but i‚Äôve realized how unwelcoming korean people are and it‚Äôs so upsetting because the country itself is so pretty if it weren't for the people i would have stayed much longer</p>
