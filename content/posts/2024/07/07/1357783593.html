      <p>I already did and tbh heâ€™s usually good about addressing these things so I hope he doesnâ€™t do it again. It obviously wasnâ€™t done to mock anyone but that doesnâ€™t mean it should be done.</p>

      <p>I think it's better to address these kind of things on fansings when you have the opportunity to explain to a person his mistake calmly</p>
