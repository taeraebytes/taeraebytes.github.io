      <p>seeing riize and tws encores god... zb1 deserve so much better like how are our lead vocalists clearing both groups but we had it the worst this shit is sinister and unfair i'm not necessarily ot9 but when i see how bad everything went for the group i get so pissed like they were supposed to be shitting on every other 5 gen group in terms of success.</p>

      <p>Seeing their encores after zb1s I just got so mad like the talent gap is so obvious but they don't get any of the perks it's so unfair like praises for a voice crack .... ARE WE SERIOUS ugh yea zb1 had all the tools and still have them to be the top bg but anyone would drop if they went thru what they had to go thru its a miracle they've still got their big core fandom

      <p>Trending on theqoo in 2029: “Ah f*ck, ZB1 was really a legendary group...”
Top comments :
{+3k} Honestly their music was good and the members were handsome too.. we will never see a lineup like this again
{+2k} If it wasnt for that f*cker Jiwoong they would have been much bigger
{+1.6k} It’s sad to see how some of them ended up, who knew Gunwook would be the most popular now ㄷㄷㄷ
      ㄴ {+500} Heol Park Gunwook was in a k-pop group?</p>
