      <p>at first i thought it was a harmless tweet too but seeing their tweets after it gained attention and them having fun with it when they can see a bunch of people using it to drag hao in their qrts thats when jrosins started to indirect tweet them too 😭 and hao didnt even say he hates the name lol</p>

      <p>I follow choco she doesn't tweet hao hate and didn't before the gpds are only rlly defending her I haven't seen any of them hate idk ab the jris tho. everything from rosins I've seen so far only connects back to the og tweet idk who started what but it just looks like a harmless tweet to me but everyone's priv or suspended now 🤷‍♀️

      <p>it was really just some opinions you tweet about if you didnt like the joke and some people used it as an opportunity to send hate to hao like the qrts had become soo unrelated and just nasty thats why jrosins wished they deleted it sooner but they are priv now so yeah</p>

      <p>Yea the tweet itself was fine but also it was probably muted it blew up so I don't except op to see what's happening in the qrts esp since it was tweeted a day ago miskeen she changed her name and everything cuz rosins were attacking her 😭
