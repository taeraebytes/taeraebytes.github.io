      <p>Queef and anons, what do yall want for this comeback? Music and concept wise. I personally like the season theme they got going on. They have done summer, spring and winter. So fall is left, and it reminds me of the very first teaser they released with haobin. It was actually intriguing but well, they expanded nothing on that. Would love it if they developed the video game concept more like you could do so much with it. As for music, hoping its cohesive like yits and the songs to be on their range like run run cover. I actually want it to be a full length album this time.</p>

      <p>This cb is definitely not fall and lowkey we made the whole seasons thing up they're not consistent in anything they do like the whole trilogy thing zeroses talk ab isn't realðŸ˜­ but for this concept I just hope it's fresh fits august and they reincorporate the game concept back in the back to zerobase video was the best thing ever

      <p>talking about the youth trilogy and strategically planned poorly laid out canva graphics hinting at the next release... yall just made that up! wakeone doesn't have the foresight or creativity to do anything interesting like that and if that actually WAS a conscious choice it would actually make me even more mad bc i'd rather have fun, interesting, well thought out, aesthetically pleasing concepts that have nothing to do with each other than the shit on a platter we got for this "youth trilogy"</p>

      <p>Like I saw someone tweet about the "trilogy" yesterday and I actually had to ask myself where the fuck that came from ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­??? Like in bloom crush and ftp have nothing to do with each other. Like we got booboo on a platter in terms of cohesive concepts there wasn't anything

      <p>during ftp promos, members were saying that those 3 albums were a trilogy but i feel like the company just made that up bc it's such a half-baked concept. as anon said here they definitely took 'you had me at hello' from zerose theories so they could look like they had something cooking all along and they weren't just throwing making stuff up towards the end. like bro ur literally just lazy and terrible with graphic design, if u intentionally made the 'lore' be that their album logo is half cropped out of the cover then that's stupid ðŸ˜­</p>
