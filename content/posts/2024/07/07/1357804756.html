      <p>girl Zhang Hao was watching that show every damn Thursday, that's family to him already. Taerae has sisters there.

Jiwoong is no one's family.

And we can just force Gyuvin bc he will hype up anything that Hanbin says, Yujin will be like yeah whatever, Matthew is good vibes so he will be fine with it, Ricky same as yujin, Gunwook vibes with anyone and I know he wants sisters. So we got a family now.</p>
