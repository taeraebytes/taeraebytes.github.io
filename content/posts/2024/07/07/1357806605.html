      <p>Shbpics is just a media account. Shbcloud used to post translations and all other cute fansign moments. Now Hanbin doesn't have an account like that.</p>

      <p>girl hill is a queen she know how those zeroses are so when people came at her for being rps she shut down the crazy tweets and stopped the delusional ones ðŸ˜­. and then her priv acc has less than 100 followers so zeroses won't come for them. she will stay strong</p>

      <p>Hill is haobinplanet not shbcloud! But yes she's super professional I'm glad she stopped addressing akgaes even if they literally always pathetically camp in her qrts to harass her like she's very pro and brings in engagement I like her</p>

haobinsplanet a haobin acc CHOP

Well ig its my seokryudan since she's a useful translation acc and does a decent amt of group tweeting but idk we need smth a bit more centered and im not gonna expect a translation acc to take on the load of doing group updating it's hard work

      <p>If they are typical to usual korean stan accs then yeah they may know but wont care about intl side, stan twt just like in korean will have its own lingo and customs and theres enough shit on ktwt to deal with too. But i will say i see a lot of intl stan discussions be brought up or even ss'ed and posted onto weibo, theres a chance if zh lurks he sees that too. I am sad about it but i think its inevitable they saw those weird haobinner girls i think who are russian, the one that spams zh alleged ex</p>
