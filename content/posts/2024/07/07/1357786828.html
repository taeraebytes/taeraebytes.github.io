      <p>what we need this cb:
- relay dance
- mv reaction
- ot9 photoshoots/interviews
- mmtg
- more of9 schedules in general (idol radio would be good bc i personally like the radio schedules but sunwoo is a tweaker so then everyoneâ€™s satisfied)
- gunwook self written verse
- youngjiâ€™s show is apparently supposed to come back so if it comes back in time hao should go on bc heâ€™d be hilarious, itâ€™s a famous show, they already had that pic together so they probably get on idc if sheâ€™s annoying
- good choreo, concept pics and mv that are actually exciting
- casual ig lives tho they could already do that now ðŸ™„
- zbtv return but improved
- non-dance tiktoks to promote the songs which are actually GOOD mp/sweat/ftp ones were traumatising
- more cohesive album.. we donâ€™t need yhmah the re-up we need yits/mp 2.0
what else</p>

      <p>YES SISTER EXACTLY and we need to create unique content on platforms reposting the same stuff from tiktok to YouTube shorts isn't good they should try smth new with YouTube and try to do paid promo with people that post on there
