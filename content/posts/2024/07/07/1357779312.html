      <p>Nct 127 besides were better than their Title tracks. Why to do you think they
if stans called them experimental which is a more sophisticated word for  pots and pans music? they flopped because the songs were whack.</p>

      <p>Not nctzens but the gen kpop stans. Nctzens eat up the pots and pans music obviously thatâ€™s why they are nctzens. Sticker is hated by the members themselves , pretty much all the members donâ€™t fock with their title songs lmfao.</p>
