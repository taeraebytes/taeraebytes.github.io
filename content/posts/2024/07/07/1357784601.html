      <p>Queef and anons, what do yall want for this comeback? Music and concept wise. I personally like the season theme they got going on. They have done summer, spring and winter. So fall is left, and it reminds me of the very first teaser they released with haobin. It was actually intriguing but well, they expanded nothing on that. Would love it if they developed the video game concept more like you could do so much with it. As for music, hoping its cohesive like yits and the songs to be on their range like run run cover. I actually want it to be a full length album this time.</p>

      <p>talking about the youth trilogy and strategically planned poorly laid out canva graphics hinting at the next release... yall just made that up! wakeone doesn't have the foresight or creativity to do anything interesting like that and if that actually WAS a conscious choice it would actually make me even more mad bc i'd rather have fun, interesting, well thought out, aesthetically pleasing concepts that have nothing to do with each other than the shit on a platter we got for this "youth trilogy"</p>

      <p>Like I saw someone tweet about the "trilogy" yesterday and I actually had to ask myself where the fuck that came from ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­??? Like in bloom crush and ftp have nothing to do with each other. Like we got booboo on a platter in terms of cohesive concepts there wasn't anything
