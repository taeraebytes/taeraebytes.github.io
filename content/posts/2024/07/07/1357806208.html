      <p>i don't know much about the group but post-finale after izna was announced i was checking their fans tweets and they seemed pretty unified. there was an izna pics account too. i don't think they have many akgaes, of course that could change since it's only their 3rd day out here but yeah ðŸ˜”</p>
