      <p>Queef and anons, what do yall want for this comeback? Music and concept wise. I personally like the season theme they got going on. They have done summer, spring and winter. So fall is left, and it reminds me of the very first teaser they released with haobin. It was actually intriguing but well, they expanded nothing on that. Would love it if they developed the video game concept more like you could do so much with it. As for music, hoping its cohesive like yits and the songs to be on their range like run run cover. I actually want it to be a full length album this time.</p>

      <p>This cb is definitely not fall and lowkey we made the whole seasons thing up they're not consistent in anything they do like the whole trilogy thing zeroses talk ab isn't realðŸ˜­ but for this concept I just hope it's fresh fits august and they reincorporate the game concept back in the back to zerobase video was the best thing ever

      <p>i know wakeone isn't the best at the whole aesthetic, conceptual side of the idol game so i think they should really lean into that and make it simple which can still be trendy and good looking (a la brat). im someone who believes that you can make something shake with nothing but a solid vision and im thinking back to the shibuya 109 photos/video and even though it was EXTREMELY simple it was a really good concept and gave us some of their best looks to date. wakeone should be capable of pulling off something like that. 

i was watching the katseye music video and i love all the fun camera work they used like having a member start a shot and then panning over to see a double of them, i wish we got more of that in their music videos. as for the music i have no expectations i've accepted that it's not what im here for as long as it's not outright bad it'll be a win for me</p>

      <p>I totally agree like as long as the vision and direction is clear you can really make a big turn around with something small that's wakeones issue the ftp rollout felt grander than anything we've had before but it was a mess conceptually everything was all over the place the visualizers were nice but what even was the purpose like we had such a Frankenstein concept as well the members couldn't even describe it to usðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ AND EXACTLY SHIBUYA 109 WAS SO NICE but yea they focus too much on seeming grand that there's holes in everything that it ends up being disappointing

      <p>I was just saying to a friend that what they really lack is actual artists in their team that have a vision for them it's like every person in the company is just a finance bro you can do so much more with a way smaller budget</p>
