      <p>tbh i think everyone lost lots of fans everywhere esp in korea but members who had bp fandoms built more in places that comparatively aren't seeing as drastic fan loss (cn, japan) may have felt it a bit less?  still this is normal though survival show groups usually peak on debut night & keep going down from there we should just enjoy the time we have left</p>

      <p>no bc when matthew came out here talking about wanting to win a daesang he pissed me off like can you hope for something realistic we have tweakers and chart fiends ready to end it all if the group doesnt have big 4 level numbers and achievements. if they want to win song of the year they should release the song of the year we alone can't take them there</p>
