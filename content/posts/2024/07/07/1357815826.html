      <p>no but jiwoong fans already boycotting so he might as well just leave bruv, him staying in the group only hinders us and if his fans aint contributing then wtf is the point of having him here? if he leave he doesnt have to keep reactivating and activating his damn ig just leave and let it stay active his fans will be happy and we will be happy</p>

      <p>that guy who won 1st place in fantasy boys did but it was bc he hated their weird contract and took legal action or something. not sure if other members of temporary survival show groups leave but to1, though permanent, took out members and added new ones despite it being a survival show lineup and they were under wakeone ðŸ˜­ i feel like being nugu probably adds to it tho</p>
