      <p>Do you think hao will attend the blue dragon awards? The fanbase is trending something for him to attend and itâ€™s on the 19th but zb1 are attending the tecent music awards on the 20th meaning they will probably fly out on the 19th unless they are suggesting he miss it (the award show) ?</p>

      <p>Why would he even attend blue dragon when idols who sing OST never attend. That event only invites actors and just ask the winners that are idols to send some video and that's it.</p>
