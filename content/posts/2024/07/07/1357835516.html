      <p>If we are talking about hit songs: red flavor, psycho or power up.

If we are talking about songs on where they can show both their dancing and singing: Dumb dumb dumb would be the best option.

If we want a vocal slay moment: Happiness, Queendom or Feel my rhythm</p>

      <p>they've never done a cover where they had to? or like an official group one but I'm not expecting them to sing "we are queens" plus it's a double edged sword they'll get hate for changing pronouns or zeroses will say they participated in queer culture again if they don't
