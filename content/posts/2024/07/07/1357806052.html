      <p>Hanbin lost the most tbh. He was crazy popular in korea once. I am a predebut allin and his kfandom has been decreasing in size with time. it was always concerning for me. And I really hate those solo iallins who think he is doing well in korea and set him up against rosins. Like no, I don't think they were there during bp. I remember all tweets getting thousands of likes in seconds and minutes when he went to visit his ads. Now he rarely gets 1k likes. And those viral tweets don't do him any good. I'm not bragging about one 10k likes tweet when he used to get multiple ones easily before. And for intl side, his biggest account shbcloud is no longer active, the other accounts like namubin are all blocked by haobinists.</p>

      <p>Taerae definitely lost the most, I think for Hanbin it was also that his fandom had a terrible reputation in Korea and that Hanbin was clearly going through it for a while so a lot left for the next popular Korean pretty boy that was in a better promotes group a lot went to riize for ex, that's why I'm always of the opinion he should lean heavily into the wacking thing, Hao and Ricky kept gaining fans because they're very unconventional idols , haobin are still super strong because it's an unconventional pairing, there has to be something that tie the fans to you permanently hanbin also struggles with being relaxed, proactive and himself so he had troubled building a deeper more genuine connection with fans compared to gunwook or Matthew for ex who have a smaller but very loyal fanbase because the fans feel like those are their friends 

He's still the second most popular and he has improved so much, I feel like he can start expanding his fanbase and if zb1 gets more popular lock in more loyal fans if he's willing to take some risks</p>

      <p>Yea because most of the people that voted for taerae was suuuper casual and just wanted to get him in the group not a lot were fans. But yea most of these riize and tws fans are previous zeroses who just wanna stan a group with good promo it takes a lot to be a zerose. But yea hanbin declined like it was inevitable but his fandoms still the second biggest one but i think atp everyone's ready to take risks for some clout üò≠

      <p>Theres actually a term called cost-effective stanning in korea, where stans will stick to popular groups in big companies even if there are better options of music/idols they might prefer, because they know they will get constant stream of good (or non divisive ) music and content and know their popularity is secure, for the same price. I think this applied well to Boys planet, its easier to stan or be casual fan of zb1 members back then bc you have the constant stream of content, a lively community and you only know ur pick on a surface level so its harder to nitpick or see bad sides of them. I think it did carry well onto debut, where they defo delivered on the music part nobody ever complained much about the mini. Its the constant content that wk1 underestimated, when things like lives, reality shows and tiktok/genzlike promos are the backbone to kpop groups. So people realised they arent getting their money worth and those moved on.</p>

      <p>100% there was a good and consistent rush that came with watching bp and it sucks that that's we lacked and it's what ultimately ruined the group but also big4 companies rushing to produce boy groups to steal their fans as well
