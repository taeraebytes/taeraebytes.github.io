      <p>Its cause they asked for emoji suggestions and not a single person asked for the racoon  

And also probably bc theyâ€™re using two emojis for hanbin yet chose an unpopular emoji for hao. 

Its not that deep though</p>

      <p>Why are they so obsessed with hanbin bruh everyone uses two emojis for him I've seen a ton of different emojis for Hao it's not that deep, it's ironic cause during debut era I was thinking how parasociallly pathetic and jealous allins clearly were of Zhang Hao but now rosins are wayyyy more pathetic they're joining the ranks of armys blinks and orbits imo</p>

      <p>The fact that they think this is the "angry language" is so jarring ðŸ˜­ I see it a lot on stantwt in general like they'll speak standard English to their moots and then use aave during fights where they usually try to put down the other party cause they don't really have arguments lol and the digital cosplay goes deep they don't even realise it it's the lingo the manner of speech the emojis the specific gifs they use like everyttthing is from blacktwt it's digital blackface</p>
