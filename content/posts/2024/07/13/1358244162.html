      <p>I guess..? But that would mean he felt unsafe or something and he needed to speak up idk like this is kinda a freaky ass message to receive like just instant tweak

      <p>I can’t lie I seriously doubt it’s about that because if it was the case wouldn’t he just take the phone out of his hand and he deffo wouldn’t have been filming it either. Also I was there the day the video dropped and then got edited the chat seemed fine so I don’t think it was about that but if you went to his chat today after the tiktok dropped it got messy😭</p>

      <p>Diffrent anon but I doubt it is about the driving thing because when you deep the context and the fact hanbin already addressed it it makes no sense. Others are saying it’s because of where he was spotted the other day ☕️ place and fans were letting him know but there’s also screenshots of k fans scolding him for the tiktok with handong on his plus chat so it can be that too. Tbh there wasn’t really any bad stuff on plus chat when the video dropped even on twt I didn’t see anything bad so i seriously doubt it was related to the vlog and it has to be a more recent issue because the message was sent out of the blue and right after the tiktok was posted.</p>

      <p>wait he was spotted where? I'm assuming because it's in Korean it could be that honestly makes the most sense too

      <p>there wasn’t also anything about the tiktok on plus chat when it dropped it only got brought up on there after he apologized and it was obvi only from ifans that are antis. everyone was so confused bc most of his kfans already know that handong and him are friends and they had no problem with it the last time they did a challenge but i guess this time the messages were more of warning him not to get too close bc of the rumors thats why he said he’ll be more careful? but the part where he’s scared still doesn’t make sense to me</p>

      <p>He didn’t say he’s sacred he said instead of being scared, future tense, so like now he’s been made aware of something instead of being sacred of that. Not him already being scared of something. So it’s more like instead of being scared / worried of this in the future I’ll just think about it then act.</p>
