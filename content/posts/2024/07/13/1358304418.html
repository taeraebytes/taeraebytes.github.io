      <p>Its cause they asked for emoji suggestions and not a single person asked for the racoon  

And also probably bc theyâ€™re using two emojis for hanbin yet chose an unpopular emoji for hao. 

Its not that deep though</p>

      <p>Why are they so obsessed with hanbin bruh everyone uses two emojis for him I've seen a ton of different emojis for Hao it's not that deep, it's ironic cause during debut era I was thinking how parasociallly pathetic and jealous allins clearly were of Zhang Hao but now rosins are wayyyy more pathetic they're joining the ranks of armys blinks and orbits imo</p>

      <p>Yeah I know exactly what you mean cause the allins are actually dumb and ridiculous about the things they say so they're easier to dismiss and clown but rosins they're.. subtle and good at manipulating and twisting your words</p>

      <p>Nah fr like I remember when they twisted your words about hao facing sinophbia in Korea so bad to the point I actually had to go back and re read the chat like 5 times like they are so manipulative which is why I lowkey think their sf is so hive minded because they feed eachother bullshit (e.g new wakeonez) but do it in such a way that has them all believing it like Jesus himself came down and said it and thatâ€™s the truth to them and they literally will not be reasoned with whatsoever .</p>

      <p>OMGGGG DONT EVEN REMIND ME I have never had my words so twisted in my liiiiiife like I had to ask onlyyou if I was crazy or not. But like they really try to get in your head and tote a "I know better than you" attitude alongside the mean girl thing to give off this knock out finisher reputation I've tried to stop arguing with them to stop that door from opening again but we'll see ðŸ˜­
