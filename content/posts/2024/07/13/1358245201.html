      <p>You know its bad bad when Koreans are one of the most patriotic / 'pure blood' believers that Korean women would rather marry foreigners than Korean men. I saw an article on theqoo of a ss from a korean men forum known for misogyny that Korean women are going for Chinese men and it's pissing Korean men off so bad due to their history and clear sinophobia and it's kinda funny like yall did this to yourself ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and point proven by these nasty ass comments. 

I know misogyny is still prevalent in a lot of the world but at least they're making progress albeit slowly but Korea idk what it is but they refuse to move forward and change like they aint budging. I just saw on my tl a day ago some Korean politician was blaming Korean women for male suicides like wtf ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>it's surprising just how deeply rooted and common misogyny is in korea and not even to the pretty average level that most countries have it's very very extreme like almost on a terroristic level and crazier when u consider their development as a country like ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ like wanting to force baby girls to be in school longer for some sex education because of what the men have done to this country it's disgusting ugh I'd go for any guy except a Korean too

      <p>wasn't this change brought on by that whole one child rule, people were choosing to only have boys before they realized now there's like no girls and they had to realize the value of girls in society.... lowkey something similar is happening everywhere where birth rates are declining but instead of men deciding to become better and making a world where women would want to get married and have kids they're blaming women and trying to force us to have kids against our will</p>

      <p>I've seen this sentiment a lot so yea so in our time now they had to change because the volume of girls is so much smaller but the response in korea is so insane to me it only further declines their birth rate like I rlly hope it keeps going down it's mad
