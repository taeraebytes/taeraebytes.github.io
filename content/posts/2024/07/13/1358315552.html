      <p>That dookie Leah & Miguel couple r gonna win cuz currently the black vote is split amongst kana and korena. The brainwashed r gonna have the free reign to let Leah win bc black ppl are conflicted. But also Odell might come in clutch with his clout when he decided last minute to stop being a deadbeat brother ðŸ˜«</p>
