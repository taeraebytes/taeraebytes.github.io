      <p>rewatching the haobin movie actually made me mad the way they made hanbin seem like zhang hao's savior, only showed clips of zhang hao fawning over hanbin's performances, only put angel filter on hanbin lmaoooo fuck haobinists</p>

      <p>I am a hanbin fan and it's the opposite. I hate how haobinists always make it seem like hanbin is a beg and only cares about hao when in fact he's just nice to him and to every member</p>
