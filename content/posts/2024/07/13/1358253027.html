      <p>i dont know the details but the variety show hes on is like a brain game type show so you have to be smart the rest of the cast are more well known so ollie is out of place already and hes also basically a high school droupout so he just looks dumb on the show</p>

      <p>Because yuehua is basically SM of China and they pull crazy strings to promote their solo artists who have potential but they don't do much for groups cuz idol group culture is not that hot there</p>
