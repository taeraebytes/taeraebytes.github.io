      <p>I guess..? But that would mean he felt unsafe or something and he needed to speak up idk like this is kinda a freaky ass message to receive like just instant tweak

      <p>I can‚Äôt lie I seriously doubt it‚Äôs about that because if it was the case wouldn‚Äôt he just take the phone out of his hand and he deffo wouldn‚Äôt have been filming it either. Also I was there the day the video dropped and then got edited the chat seemed fine so I don‚Äôt think it was about that but if you went to his chat today after the tiktok dropped it got messyüò≠</p>

      <p>Diffrent anon but I doubt it is about the driving thing because when you deep the context and the fact hanbin already addressed it it makes no sense. Others are saying it‚Äôs because of where he was spotted the other day ‚òïÔ∏è place and fans were letting him know but there‚Äôs also screenshots of k fans scolding him for the tiktok with handong on his plus chat so it can be that too. Tbh there wasn‚Äôt really any bad stuff on plus chat when the video dropped even on twt I didn‚Äôt see anything bad so i seriously doubt it was related to the vlog and it has to be a more recent issue because the message was sent out of the blue and right after the tiktok was posted.</p>

      <p>there wasn‚Äôt also anything about the tiktok on plus chat when it dropped it only got brought up on there after he apologized and it was obvi only from ifans that are antis. everyone was so confused bc most of his kfans already know that handong and him are friends and they had no problem with it the last time they did a challenge but i guess this time the messages were more of warning him not to get too close bc of the rumors thats why he said he‚Äôll be more careful? but the part where he‚Äôs scared still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me</p>

      <p>He didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs sacred he said instead of being scared, future tense, so like now he‚Äôs been made aware of something instead of being sacred of that. Not him already being scared of something. So it‚Äôs more like instead of being scared / worried of this in the future I‚Äôll just think about it then act.</p>

      <p>Yeah idk how people misunderstood this so bad because in the context of the tiktok and his fans telling him not to be too close to a female idol 
‚ÄúNext time instead of being scared and doing nothing‚Äù = instead of not doing challanges with female idols in the future or being scared to do them because of the response 

‚Äúi‚Äôll think about it carefully first before acting‚Äù = i will think about the image / public opinion it will give before i do it.</p>
