      <p>@lotusbiscoff guys  Caine is spilling mad tea on his TikTok live ðŸ˜­ apparently production told him to keep liv but he went against them and chose Sierra to spite them so they got him out right away, he also said that he hated Serena,Kendall and Miguel. Called Serena a bitch, said Aaron had a crush on Rob, said all of the couples are scamming and know they wonâ€™t last outside the villa, said Aaron and Sierra did nothing but smoke, said Miguel doesnâ€™t actually like Leah and he told Caine he was just doing it for the money. He said a whole bunch of shit give me a min but Iâ€™m laughing so hard like this man is getting blacklisted from everything not even a reunion appearance ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
