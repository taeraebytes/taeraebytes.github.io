    "question": "Anon If you are referring to when the translator says South american birds, that actually means a women that is obsessed with men. Thats because 남미새 (what they are saying) is an abbrevaition of 남자에 미친 새끼 (man obsessed bitch). It is translated to South american bird because translator doesnt understand abbreviated slang, and 남미새 can be broken down into 남미 (South America) and 새 (bird - the animal). It doesnt have anything to do with international fans they will call it for any girl who likes kpop men, anime men ect to the point of being stupid, hope this helped",
    "reply": "oh..... idk if that's what they meant but that's what I was thinking I didn't know it was that omg"
