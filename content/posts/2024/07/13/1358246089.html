 thatâ€™s over $6800, is it normal to manufacture it before you have all the funds or at least 90%</p>

      <p>hmmmmmm maybe they have an option to pay after the completion like if they don't pay it it's not like the manufacturers would give it to them. Probably a 50% advance before production but I'm surprised it hasn't been made already?

      <p>Nah the mess with Rickyâ€™s c bar is because 1 person funded the whole mic but the c bar still collected funds for it without letting fans know and then went mia</p>

      <p>I don't think it was fake? but the Ricky fans were saying it was exaggerated and coming out at an interesting time when it was already known

      <p>the mic issue was real but apparently that issue was already handled 2 weeks ago on weibo or something but an anti? brought it on twitter for whatever reason right before their running man schedule and accused a some riyangis who cross post twt/ tiktok posts onto weibo as admins of his cbar and friends with sasaengs but they werent and just did it for free to show c riyangis viral intl posts about ricky on twitter and tiktok. 

so timing for that expose thread was suss because it was right before his very first chinese schedule and the issue was already handled 2 weeks ago. Intent was clear tbh</p>
