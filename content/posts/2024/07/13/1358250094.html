      <p>I guess..? But that would mean he felt unsafe or something and he needed to speak up idk like this is kinda a freaky ass message to receive like just instant tweak

      <p>I can’t lie I seriously doubt it’s about that because if it was the case wouldn’t he just take the phone out of his hand and he deffo wouldn’t have been filming it either. Also I was there the day the video dropped and then got edited the chat seemed fine so I don’t think it was about that but if you went to his chat today after the tiktok dropped it got messy😭</p>

      <p>Yeah it makes no sense to be that because why would he randomly talk about it 3 days later especially when it wasn’t really an issue when the video dropped and there’s definitely no one is mentioning it now 😭. iOS more likely to be because of the tiktok because he sent the message right after it dropped and people were spamming his post about being to close to handong and travelling all the way to mca to film with here and even kfans were messaging him telling him to keep distance from female idols
