      <p>lowkey they dont want that anyway theyre just fine thinking he's hot driving with one hand i dont think it matters to them whether he's athletic bc then they start losing it about getting too fit and man-like and they need him to remain twinky and non-threatening</p>

      <p>He is almost all of zb1 are twinky but the definition of that word is very Eurocentric, hanbin is naturally pretty submissive so he will always try to be perfect, athletic but in a lean way is probably what he wants to go for for now he's still a twink which isn't bad</p>

      <p>It's definitely more Eurocentric it's why I just don't rlly think he is one because the measure wasn't considering Asian men like he's just average but yea idols got no choice but to go for a leaner build ngl I prefer it too

      <p>Yeah you can't really use that term in a sokor context cause no zb1 member is particularly twinky, even being gay passing is different if it weren't for his past probably I wouldn't clock Hao for example but definitely Hanbin maybe Taerae for Chinese people it might be the opposite idk (half Korean no I cannot translate I'm extremely mid sorry)</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it's ok thank you for considering usðŸ’” but yea like the term never considered asian men so like it feels weird to use and right i wouldnt have clocked hao either
