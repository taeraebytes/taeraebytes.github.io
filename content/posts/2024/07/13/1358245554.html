 that’s over $6800, is it normal to manufacture it before you have all the funds or at least 90%</p>

      <p>hmmmmmm maybe they have an option to pay after the completion like if they don't pay it it's not like the manufacturers would give it to them. Probably a 50% advance before production but I'm surprised it hasn't been made already?

      <p>Nah the mess with Ricky’s c bar is because 1 person funded the whole mic but the c bar still collected funds for it without letting fans know and then went mia</p>

      <p>I don't think it was fake? but the Ricky fans were saying it was exaggerated and coming out at an interesting time when it was already known
