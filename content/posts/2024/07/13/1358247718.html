      <p>You know its bad bad when Koreans are one of the most patriotic / 'pure blood' believers that Korean women would rather marry foreigners than Korean men. I saw an article on theqoo of a ss from a korean men forum known for misogyny that Korean women are going for Chinese men and it's pissing Korean men off so bad due to their history and clear sinophobia and it's kinda funny like yall did this to yourself 😭😭😭😭😭 and point proven by these nasty ass comments. 

I know misogyny is still prevalent in a lot of the world but at least they're making progress albeit slowly but Korea idk what it is but they refuse to move forward and change like they aint budging. I just saw on my tl a day ago some Korean politician was blaming Korean women for male suicides like wtf 😭</p>

      <p>it's surprising just how deeply rooted and common misogyny is in korea and not even to the pretty average level that most countries have it's very very extreme like almost on a terroristic level and crazier when u consider their development as a country like 😟😟😟 like wanting to force baby girls to be in school longer for some sex education because of what the men have done to this country it's disgusting ugh I'd go for any guy except a Korean too

      <p>They have specific slurs for Korean women that go with Chinese and Japanese men meanwhile Korean men are also massively marrying Vietnamese and Japanese women, not any of my business but 🤦‍♀️</p>

      <p>there's a reason why Korean men go for Japanese and Vietnamese and some SEA women tbh and it's because they're stereotypically submissive, housewife mindset and they put Korean men on a pedestal because of Korean influence (kdrama, kpop etc) and Korean men know that and are taking advantage of it. Tbh as a women I'm not trying to put another women down but they're honestly way too blindsided believing that the K actors and K idols they see on screen is how Korean men are irl so by the time they realize it's nothing but a facade they're in too deep, they're already living in Korea with children and esp for Viet/ SEA women korea is better than living back home so they just endure it.

It's actually really sad and it's also why Korean men don't go for Chinese women because they're stereotypically firmer and don't fall for their bs</p>
