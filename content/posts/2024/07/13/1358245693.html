      <p>Its cause they asked for emoji suggestions and not a single person asked for the racoon  

And also probably bc theyâ€™re using two emojis for hanbin yet chose an unpopular emoji for hao. 

Its not that deep though</p>

      <p>Why are they so obsessed with hanbin bruh everyone uses two emojis for him I've seen a ton of different emojis for Hao it's not that deep, it's ironic cause during debut era I was thinking how parasociallly pathetic and jealous allins clearly were of Zhang Hao but now rosins are wayyyy more pathetic they're joining the ranks of armys blinks and orbits imo</p>

      <p>Literally it kills me cause you do NOT speak like that like they know they have no credibility and are ridiculous so they hype themselves up by doing borderline digital blackface whole time they're 26yo Indonesian women</p>
