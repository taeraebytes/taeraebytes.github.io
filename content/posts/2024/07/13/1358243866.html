      <p>The acc just needs to keep it moving and not apologise or care about what they say at all like they're not trying to actually help rosins literally don't want ot9 unit they terrorise quite literally every zb1 acc and cc slash rs, don't put yourself in a submissive position from the get go, ignore and keep it moving, haobinsplanet is still the biggest zb1 fanacc by far</p>
