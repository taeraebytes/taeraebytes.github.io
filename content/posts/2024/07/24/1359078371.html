      <p>trainee and artist contracts are different yes but we don't know the terms or if they're signed under different contracts with their respective companies. And like people think it'll probably take a lotttt for yuehua to give up hao

      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group theyâ€™d push out ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him ðŸ’”

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>No he won't probably be able to do music at best he can be a variety darling like fan cheng cheng and Wang yibo esp w the yh connection he wouldn't get to sing a lot but he'd get more money than 99% of top idols in Korea idk if that's what he wants tho</p>
