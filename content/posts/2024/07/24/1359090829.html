      <p>They did buy ads which isn’t unusual for aotm but even then the ads ran after a couple hours and I’d say based on how much they raised only generated 200-300k views it also depends what else is dropping at the same time like if other big or popular videos are dropping it’s going to be harder for it to trend. Also I’ve never heard of views being botted yt is extremely rigid in that and if there were attempts of that just like we’ve seen many times before with mass streaming there would have been a massive view freeze or drop and that hasn’t happened as of now.</p>

      <p>I agree with this anon, we are all in the know allins buy views on fancams ( but so have other sf) but it’s basically impossible to bott views on that scale and there would have been mass freezes if they had and big drops in the view numbers when they deleted the botted views which we see happening all the time in kpop but there hasn’t been anything of the sort so I think it’s safe to say that aside from the ads they are running most views are probably just from people checking it out out of curiosity. Like I don’t Stan anyone else whose done aotm but I’ve still watched them all because i enjoy seeing what they create, i imagine other people are the same.</p>

      <p>That makes sense but the question of the YouTube trend still stands I honestly don't think it's a big deal but that's all
