      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group theyâ€™d push out ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him ðŸ’”

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>anon I think u just dont get him, I think theres a clear line when it comes to acquaintances and friends to him and hes just the type to have 3 friends and be totally happy and u can clearly tell who his friends are in the group but doesnt mean he dislikes the other members and dont talk or joke around with them</p>

      <p>Right I I think his relationships with the members are cute they don't all have to be his bffs but they get on well and esp for the amt of time they've known each other it's comfortable

      <p>of course they get along well like I think we forgetting that Zerobaseone is a group that was basically a clique in boys planet, all members either were friends or were friend of a friend, this was mentioned especially during say my name and over me when people said that the cliques kicked out the remaining members</p>
