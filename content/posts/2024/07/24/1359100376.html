      <p>That's surprising cause he's the only member I find actually very ugly like imo he's the only visual hole in the group, I've always liked his personality and he always sings live plus can dance so no hate</p>

      <p>he is and I think overall standards matter like in America Sohees popular and considered cute same with Matthew the standards are less harsh me personally I used to find him cute too till I saw him irl and I used to find Matthew regular till I saw him irl as well but definitely sohee has wayyyyyyy better styling it serves him pretty well

      <p>Sohee is popular in America because of constant negative pann articles and America being savior complex like sohee because of that.</p>
