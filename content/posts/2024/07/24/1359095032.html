      <p>trainee and artist contracts are different yes but we don't know the terms or if they're signed under different contracts with their respective companies. And like people think it'll probably take a lotttt for yuehua to give up hao

      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group theyâ€™d push out ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him ðŸ’”

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>No he won't probably be able to do music at best he can be a variety darling like fan cheng cheng and Wang yibo esp w the yh connection he wouldn't get to sing a lot but he'd get more money than 99% of top idols in Korea idk if that's what he wants tho</p>

      <p>Yea it seems like variety's the way to go in China but he seems like he'd wanna continue promoting as an idol in korea

      <p>Maybe itâ€™s personal perspective but money might not mean everything and I think considering he gave up a really stable life back in China to come to Korea he would probably want to stay and have a career here</p>

      <p>He wasn't particularly financially stable but still went for an art degree I think that's saying something he clearly values stability (only going to Korea after getting his licence) but honestly I'd be surprised and lose a lot of respect for him if he settles for being a variety star and mediocre actor, he's not my favourite member but I have always seen him as a real and very respectable artist</p>

      <p>I just take him making it to college and deciding then to be an idol as having a previously stable life with a different future in mind so yea for him to sacrifice all that to come to korea i see him choosing it but you never know money changes people

      <p>I also have respect for Hao particularly as an artist but I do think that for him (and any of the members actually) I won't especially judge what they do post-disbandment just because it will be hard for all of them to see the same success they have now :/ Like if your passion is to be a singer but it's not as viable for any number of reasons imo it's understandable to take whatever other opportunities you have when they come up it's just a realistic thing to do. But I do agree that it would be surprising if Hao in particular chose that path and I do expect him to continue with music he doesn't currently seem super interested in either acting or variety</p>

      <p>yea unfortunately none of them are seeing the same success it sucks I wouldn't lose respect or judge either because it's two different scenarios he could go down but yea I would be surprised too if it's in his power I think he's choosing to continue down this path regardless of the prospects
