      <p>trainee and artist contracts are different yes but we don't know the terms or if they're signed under different contracts with their respective companies. And like people think it'll probably take a lotttt for yuehua to give up hao

      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group theyâ€™d push out ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him ðŸ’”

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>diff anon i think it would be interesting if ricky started acting post disbandment like solo doesn't necessarily have to mean music but we'll see what he's interested in</p>

      <p>Damn I didnâ€™t see it before but that anon said rosins will really compare everything between hanbin and hao was really onto something ðŸ˜­ anon what fucking crack are you on it wasnâ€™t about hanbin being the first mc win they just wanted hanbin to give zb1 a win because the other mcs have given their groups a win too thatâ€™s so normal. Also what did hao being the mubank mc have to do with zb1 winning, zb1 were already locked in for the win before his mc announcement even dropped.</p>
