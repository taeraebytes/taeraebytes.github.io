      <p>I feel like because fans tweak whenever yuehuaz or wakeonez get mentioned they thought this was the best option like imagine they go the same event and here off into the yuehuaz and wakeonez when zerose already tweak at simple messages</p>

      <p>the tweaking started after they were formed so it's just a clause they already considered but yea you'd have to kill me #thankyou

      <p>I'm pretty sure all survival show groups have always had an unspoken (or maybe even spoken?) rule to not talk about their previous groups or agencies but zb1 are just a bunch of tweakers and do it anyways</p>
