      <p>I feel like it's something a hardcore gpd would understand there's an image that people want him to have or convince themselves he has on intltwt so it gets really annoying watching him be misinterpreted everyday on the iside and the tongue piercing stuff made it worse and with how hard people ran with it. Like we talk about the box intl fans put the members in and the misinterpreting that always happens its just that. And also in his live you could tell he was worried about the whole thing cuz 1 it really does go against his image and 2 its just smth he could face a lot of scrutiny for he was asking fans to love him no matter what he looks like i was feeling bad but theres also another reason for that. The statement surprised me but I get it weirdly this is the most zeroses have cared ab gunwook and the whole convo was starting to irk me too
