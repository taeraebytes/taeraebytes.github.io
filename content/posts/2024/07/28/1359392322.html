    "question": "I'm not attempting to side with Yejigf. But, as someone who has attended a LA fan event. Yujin is well-liked; it's only that people were hesitant to tell him I love you because the majority of the zerose I met there were between the ages of 19 and 25, so I understand the uneasiness because some zerose have difficulty expressing such things to minors. One thing I noticed about Yujin was that he was not feeling well. I saw him step out from stage a few of times i believe because of vomiting. I can tell that the boys are exhausted and sleep starved. Wakeone is sucking them dry.",
    "reply": "hmmmm idk even if ur 19-25 what's wrong with saying I love you me personally I sont see the issue and ik that's what a lot of people go with since he's a minor but I agree i dont rlly think the yejigf is a big deal hi touches are rushed af but apparently there's clips from dfesta I saw but I watched when I was half asleep. But I don't think that he's not feeling well I think he's just shy"
