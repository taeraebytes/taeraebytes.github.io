    "question": "okay I just wanted to give my quick perspective as someone who went dfesta i sent a cc yesterday. i would say each member who was signing or taking pics would stay in a certain area and try and sign as much, which meant if ur section was ‚Äúdone‚Äù the other members wouldnt lurk as much and just wave to move on. So for us it was hanbin and i luckily got a pc signed, they did so much to a point i think the staff told them to do a lottt they were taking professional pictures, i guess to promote their opening soon. Now onto yujin, i genuinely didnt notice him at all bc all of them were moving so fast, but looking back on my videos i think its right to say he wasnt getting much demand or ppl calling to interact with him which is sad. but thats all that i can say and seeing those vids on twt made me sad i dont think ppl did it on purpose but there was defooo a interaction hungry ppl who would ignore members for their bias. i dont think he particularly looked off tho in general it was a really nice event and they looked shocked at the amount of ppl who cameü•∫",
    "reply": "yea it looked like that to me as well and from what I heard from my friends there were sections each member was sticking around to. And I totally agree when it comes to an event like dfesta where ur trying to get ur biases attention or ur favs attention ur bound to ignore I felt sad watching too but it's just inevitable ngl it happens and not just here but I'm sooo happy seeing the turnout there were so many people"
