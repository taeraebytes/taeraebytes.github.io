      <p>I felt bad for that Shelby person when the shippers were jumping her and thought they were overexaggerating but ngl reading her tweets it seems like she really does think hanbin is crazy about her or something</p>

      <p>It’s so funny because she’s always like omg he noticed me or remembered me and it’s like sis you have been to nearly every fancall he’s probably seen your face more than his own mama I’d be suprised if he didn’t remember you 😭</p>
