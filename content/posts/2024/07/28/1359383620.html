      <p>ok i donâ€™t like yejigf so this is not a defense for him specifically but i really feel like zeroses do too much with this whole witch hunting anyone that doesnâ€™t give their bias the same level of attention thing itâ€™s like they live to attack people ðŸ˜­ like the whole kcon experience is so overwhelming and there are so many moving parts at once itâ€™s natural that ppl will get overwhelmed and accidentally miss someone or be rushed through the last set of people or something like that and i doubt zb1 even remembers that one person gave them slightly less attention than the others itâ€™s not that big of a deal at the end of the day but everything is a big deal to zeroses</p>

      <p>Zeroses always do this and it's always people who are never there I saw the video and was actually shocked at the outrage. First and foremost why would someone upload themselves publicly ignoring a member on INTL ZEROSETWT ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and second the camera is not someone's eyes im crying like a rushed hi touch event that's less than a minute long isn't gonna be perfect ur not gonna get to see everyone and equal amt. it's really not a big deal zeroses just rlly have a thing for dogpiling on people it's weird
