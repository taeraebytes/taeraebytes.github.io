      <p>I watched this and it was actually pretty fun either they bossed up on zepisodes or they've always been fun and nobody watched them ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and yea jiwoong just doesn't kick it with them probably texting his gf

      <p>Diff anon but it just irks me especially lately like im IRK'D how jiwoong doesn't even try to get close... if ur not gonna participate in the conversion at least sit with them and laugh or something just to show u acknowledge your peers especially since they're your members and literally victims of your scandal and suffering the consequences because of you but when i watched the vid anon linked and even in previous zepisodes too it seems like he's never in the same room ðŸ˜­ 

But then when they're on stage or with fans, the Grammy thing for example he's suddenly doing all these fanservice with his most popular duo. He's just so fake and I'm seriously so sick I wanna puke.</p>

      <p>gurl wdgs gonna blame the members and say they excluding him ðŸ¤§ no im srs okay maybe I only saw 5 tweets but some wdgs solos legit think the members are excluding him and I wont be surprised if this mindset grows and spreads to other wdgs with the lack of Jiwoong x members interactions in these Zepisodes or other BTS content so when it does happen I told ya so</p>

      <p>wdg solos already believe everything they make up in their heads and I'm p sure they already think this they can do whatever they want no one really listens
