      <p>Diff anon but it just irks me especially lately like im IRK'D how jiwoong doesn't even try to get close... if ur not gonna participate in the conversion at least sit with them and laugh or something just to show u acknowledge your peers especially since they're your members and literally victims of your scandal and suffering the consequences because of you but when i watched the vid anon linked and even in previous zepisodes too it seems like he's never in the same room ðŸ˜­ 

But then when they're on stage or with fans, the Grammy thing for example he's suddenly doing all these fanservice with his most popular duo. He's just so fake and I'm seriously so sick I wanna puke.</p>

      <p>yea this is why I can never rate him his dynamics are more than fine when he's forced to be with them but he always goes off by himself and never interacts in other stuff like I rllllllyyyyy don't get it

      <p>gurl wdgs gonna blame the members and say they excluding him ðŸ¤§ no im srs okay maybe I only saw 5 tweets but some wdgs solos legit think the members are excluding him and I wont be surprised if this mindset grows and spreads to other wdgs with the lack of Jiwoong x members interactions in these Zepisodes or other BTS content so when it does happen I told ya so</p>

      <p>wdg solos already believe everything they make up in their heads and I'm p sure they already think this they can do whatever they want no one really listens

      <p>Off topic but this makes me think of the wdg who genuinely thought he would have made the best leader for the group, like he doesnâ€™t even get along with most the members could you imagine what that would look like now, a leader who never interacts of lives with the group</p>
