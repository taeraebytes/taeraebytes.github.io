      <p>Diff anon but it just irks me especially lately like im IRK'D how jiwoong doesn't even try to get close... if ur not gonna participate in the conversion at least sit with them and laugh or something just to show u acknowledge your peers especially since they're your members and literally victims of your scandal and suffering the consequences because of you but when i watched the vid anon linked and even in previous zepisodes too it seems like he's never in the same room ðŸ˜­ 

But then when they're on stage or with fans, the Grammy thing for example he's suddenly doing all these fanservice with his most popular duo. He's just so fake and I'm seriously so sick I wanna puke.</p>
