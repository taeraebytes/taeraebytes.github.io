      <p>This mix n max thingy is ridiculous bc why is grown ass ZH telling Yujin to ask WAKEONE to do mix n max togetherüò≠. The worst thing is that there's already evidence of Yujin saying that he wants to go with Hanbin before.

Like idk wakeone let's just send our maknaes Gunwookie and Yujinie</p>
