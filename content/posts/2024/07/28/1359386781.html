      <p>am i too overthinking if the planet b show is popular and a lot of zeroses will move to them.. and their debut will be a few months before zb1 disband probably ughh can we enjoy our last moment with zb1 first</p>

      <p>auditions open next month and I predict it'll take about a year for the show to kick off I think it'll be fine honestly boys planet had such a one in a million cast the timeline will probably follow Kepler and izna

      <p>It'll be more popular but I'm saying timeline as in veeeery end of zb1 maybe even during their disbandment it's not gonna be a thing where the new group promotes with zb1

      <p>But kepler wouldnt have gotten their popularity without it as hikaru mashiro are top 3 most popular, u see Gp999 got viral in Japan bc of those two who kinda broke the stereotype of untalented Japanese idols that pd48 showed.</p>
