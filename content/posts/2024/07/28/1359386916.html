      <p>hi if ur interested this is my m&g experience from yesterday
it was my first and only zb1 event i got tickets v last minute and luckily. i went alone but everyone was lovely esp this one angel haobin fan who got me food
the actual event before the mg was... interesting honestly i couldnt hear very well bc the sound system was trash like what y‚Äôall heard with the mic, yeah it was like that but worse. plus there was some events nearby with loud speakers so it was v messy organisation. but zb1 were cute honestly my heart was just pounding i dont remember anything 

then the time to meet themm i was one of the first groups which i was happy about. i could already see the staff being annoying literally nobody got good interactions with gv cause he was last and by that point you would be physically pushed

i wouldnt say any of my interactions were out of this world they look absolutely better in real life and hanbin complimented my style (he said - styleüëç).</p>
