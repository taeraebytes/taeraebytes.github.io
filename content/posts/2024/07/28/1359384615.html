      <p>no offense but does anyone else feel like matthew needs a little TikTok timeout…. this is literally what you see when you open their profile

likeejjhbm like im sorry but they HAVE to implement some kind of limit to how many TikToks one member can post in a row like 6/12 posts is a little bit ridiculous 😭

the one he posted today pushed me over the edge bc it wasn’t even a challenge or something that ppl want to see he’s just making nonsense melting point tiktoks again 💔</p>
