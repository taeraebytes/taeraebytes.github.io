      <p>Sorry for the negativity. But I think them making another survival show means that the members don't want to extend their contract or they don't have a plan to extend the contract of zb1. The fact that they made another survival show so fast after the first one is really for smth elseðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i also don't think this show has anything to do with zb1's contract. it's just that kpop has become too commercial even sm is following hybe's lead; they apperantly want to debut 2 group within the next year. cj just wants more money makers, since zb1 has a fandom with huge buying power they want to replicate that by debuting a group as soon as possible so that the people who support zb1 don't leave for other groups when they disband.Â </p>
