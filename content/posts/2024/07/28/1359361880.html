      <p>I just saw the whole dance relay thing. At first I thought that one anon saying only certain members did well was them being a hater but I felt it too. Hanbin, Gunwook, and Ricky did the best for me followed by Matthew. Everytime it was Jiwoong's turn I start laughing (how does he make me laugh every single time?), Hao did bad, he could do better (he can but he didn't, why did he dance awkwardly, it was a little awful to look at), yujin should gain a little weight (he looks so weak dancing), gyuvin was just being himself. Ricky despite being a weak dancer he did well (side eyeing yujin and hao)</p>
