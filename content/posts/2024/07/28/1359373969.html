      <p>am i too overthinking if the planet b show is popular and a lot of zeroses will move to them.. and their debut will be a few months before zb1 disband probably ughh can we enjoy our last moment with zb1 first</p>

      <p>auditions open next month and I predict it'll take about a year for the show to kick off I think it'll be fine honestly boys planet had such a one in a million cast the timeline will probably follow Kepler and izna

      <p>It'll be more popular but I'm saying timeline as in veeeery end of zb1 maybe even during their disbandment it's not gonna be a thing where the new group promotes with zb1

      <p>well thats just inevitable tbh obviously so many zeroses stanned survival show groups and they will continue to do so, like me for example sorry im a survival show junkie and i’m already on that bp2 telegram🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️  but i assure u the core fandom of each member will not go anywhere</p>
