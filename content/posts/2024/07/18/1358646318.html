      <p>pretty much I guess it's cuz his hands aren't rlly slender but it was mainly cuz he's tan omg I don't even wanna repeat some of the crazy shit they said about his fingersğŸ˜­ but he genuinely grooms them so well he was known for his pretty nail beds in bp fans would always talk ab how nice his hands are he takes care of his nails real good

      <p>wait no I rmb this too I think that bitch bosongee posted it right? I think it wasnt about him being tan but his finger joints being dark/ black because they said when fat ppl lose weight in a short time their knuckles and finger joints turn black or some shit and they were fat shaming him ğŸ˜­</p>
