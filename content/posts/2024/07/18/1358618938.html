      <p>wow I'm rewriting this a second time and it's actually so hard I feel like I have to put everything I've ever said in the last year into one but also write more than one sentence ab the members idc about fuckkkkkkk

jiwoong- not wasting my words on him very clear in what my opinion is about him I feel like 

taerae- still a little bit of a weird guy to me I just find him so not regular and the things he does sometimes is so funny to me half of it comes across as an act I've only recently warmed up to him but he's aight I do feel bad ab his fans abusing him a different me would've said he deserved it but hey

Hanbin- used to be the literal devil in my eyes but I healed and he's just so ermmm idk himself I guess I find him a lot less calculating but that's also just cuz he's opening up I guess he still comes off grandma-like to me but maybe that's good. Hmmm idk what else to say hes still insecure but im surprised at how he's been taking way more notice to his fans could be good thing could be a bad thing 

Hao- used to be my goat fans can rlly ruin someone for u he seems pretty free and sure of himself though sometimes I can find the whole babying him thing weird he's cool tho. Something kinda seems different about him it's not like I'm paying less attention to him than before but idk what it is hmmm idk what else to say oh I can def appreciate his role in the group no matter what he's an eccentric for sure too

Matty- my Canadian goattt wow i find him so cute it's crazy but he feels like someone familiar idc if he's cringe and didn't have internet for 2 years and embarrasses himself bfnenckdkfkkf ok lemme stop yea he's like a friend and it's very easy to enjoy him and even tho I never stan english speaking idols I always have to like them by default it's in my blood to. He knows his strengths and I feel like he's smart about it so that's just a plus. Is this even a brutal opinion... I kinda don't know what to say welll I think he has 0 future prospects tbh good luck to him post 2026 😭

sorry I'm actually soooo bad at this AND IM SO LAZY TODAY SORRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ask me to finish the rest tomorrow like mi cyant and I feel like I said a bunch of nothing u guys are better at this than me

      <p>LMAOAOOOO ok lemme try 

Ok Ricky is just so funny to me the way he presents himself kills me and the way it gets interpreted is funnier. He's like sooo someone id know irl hes just so cringeeee sometimes i think the insecure trait about him is wrong its more like he only posts his best and it's part of his shtick to be inactive. He's actually really funny but his thirst traps and music choices just kill me so bad like im sorry his and gyuvins song never leaves my mind. I like him a lot like wow he's just my age chingu I had to tap in I used to see what people meant when they'd call him autistic but I don't see it anymore I think he was just shy and couldn't figure himself out. he's really trying this brooding f boy kinda thing mixed with his natural personality it's kind of sticking but please get a haircut oml 

Now gyuvin he's like a sibling to me he's always irkingggggg omg but that's still someone I'll always like I might hate on him once a week but I'll come back around. He seriously knows his strengths like nooobody in the group uses their strengths to the max like he does he will make sure he's kicking it with the most popular members of their respective countries at all time he'll make sure he's the goofy personality glue of the group guy at all times like honestly the lack of talent becomes forgotten when he works the personality bit that hard. He's dumb in a way but he's smart not necessarily conniving but smart when he needs to be I can fw that it's funny to watch. He can be so middle school boy sometimes which is fun to laugh at 

Gunwook wow just my ultra goat I gotta glaze at least 50 times a day. I think the funniest thing about gunwook is he's really here for a good time and he's mindful of why he was invited to the function I'm kinda sad that he's not as go getting as he used to be like he's just took aware of peoples opinions on him. But wow I'm really about to write a thousand word paragraph about him ugh that's rlly my goat I love him so much I was rewatching clips from their horrid ftp showcase and he was the only one lit there we had to thank god his spark hasn't died out yet he's just someone I feel like will always be fine I worry ab his future a lot but eh he'll be aight he'll be happy no matter what well I'll just stop it here 

yujin wow I never thought I'd like him this much he went from someone I didn't care about to consistently being a member I rlly like idk I feel like he's interesting to me he's just a badass quiet kid to me he definitely was quiet before but he's definitely come out of his bubble I used to think he was more an idol for the clout but I'm noticing the passion yesss he really used to kill me so bad when he wouldn't lipsync or dance on stage 😭😭 like he's just so teenager like just quiet so I find him entertaining like why was he switching povs on fancalls but he's like a cute little brother to me ermmm he's definitely gonna be our most popular member post disbandment tho

THIS WAS SO HARD

      <p>diff anon and omfgg same I love maknae line so much and to me maknae includes ricky does he for you? I always get confused when u guys talk about maknae line and anyways just wanted to give my take cuz maknae line theyre so fuckin fun and without them idt I'd love zb1 as much as i do now

ricky yeah he kills me so badddddd in a good way 😭 I only got to know him after zb1 so he seemed somewhat arrogant at first in the way he presented himself but I've grown to love him because now I know he just wants to show us his best side and theres an image he wants to be seen as on stage which I find really adorable cuz his real personality is just goofy. ngl the more I see of him the more he reminds me of me and my irl friends cuz we always trying to portray ourselves as some baddies 😭😭😭 I also really like his humor and he's prob the one I had the biggest switch up with hence why his review might be the longest, lowkey miskeen he gets misunderstood so bad at first glance but I'm glad I switched up cuz I'm down for him bad lately and one of my fav kpop personality tbh because it was getting kinda stale

gyuvin same hes dumb but smart and idt I can ever hate him, he just seems like ur typical stupid friend who talks without a filter prob due to his upbringing from always getting away with things but u have to admit he brings the best out of ppl even if he does uses them for clout but I can't blame him either, he lost a lot of his kfans early on so he must be in the slumps and desperate to gain new fans back so the clout chasing is understandable and manageable... ish, like nothing really is irking me even with the recent shimkongz stuff I just hope he doesnt cross that line again 😭

gunwook my babyyyyy love him back then love him now and I agree I wished he'd not care much about what ppl said but I can understand why, bp was depressing 😭😭😭 BUT that was what made me love him so much I loved seeing his stage persona contrasting his real personality also just seeing him improving makes me tears up. I can go on and on but he just makes me so happy I really hope he taps into english more because he totally has american humor in him

yujin is like ricky, I only got to know him after zb1 and he never really stood out like he was just the pretty maknae to me but ive also grown to love him just seeing him improve every comeback and slowly opening up and showing his personality. I also feel like theres an image he wants to portray himself as to fans but hes kinda confused like he himself does not know what that image is so I'm curious to see how he progresses

srry if this made no sense and im too lazy to proof read but man I love maknae line so much like gyuriwook lives are some of the biggest highlights to me in zb1 and I really wanna see the 4 of them together for once because they really compliment each other sm😭❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>

      <p>It's kind of confusing when I talk about maknae line yea I include Ricky but I also acknowledge when they break them up into 3 3 3 but for the most part in cc I mean to include Ricky 

He always came across as meek I just think he probably had a hard time adjusting to idol life especially cuz he tried to keep up his like socmed persona as well 

Yea gyuvins rlly just a rich kid who's never been told no 😭😭 the way he was tweaking during his microscandals made it so obvious 

I think gunwooks still confident but he's just too sensitive 😫💔 but he's smart he doesn't ever show when he's depressed so to us it just looks like he's happy and he doesn't rlly complain I gotta say thank u cuz id probably kill myself 10x over and me too sis like whys he the light of my life omo but me toooo I need him to wake up an Englishboo PLEASE BEG US 😫🙏

Yea yujins someone I came to like after the group was formed he's so chill and cute we had to tap in but yea I feel like he kinda let go of the whole "don't treat me like a maknae" thing but he's still figuring it out and he's easily the trendiest out of the group if there's anyone who can save us on social media it's him..

No it made sense lmao and it's the same for me it would be soooo much harder to stan the group without maknae line we needed the youngin linkup so bad
