      <p>It's not just about the sea thing which is important but like why and for what does a solo lightstick need to be sold for the groups very first tour.. like wow we're actually the most cooked fandom ever ðŸ˜­ if you can't see the issue with that I can't help you

      <p>sometimes i go to one wonbin solo stan's retrospring for fun, 2 days ago one of their anons was talking about how this year bnd has suppressed zb1 in streaming, and she replied that are not most of zb1's subfandoms are boycotting all the time, she literally said people talk about riize but zb1 has the most divided fandom. can you believe it. even other groups solo stans/akgaes know that we have the most divided fandom</p>
