      <p>imo if any extension really happens, hanbin will be there, he is the leader, the one responsible for many things related to the groups. no matter what others think, he is one of the members with the most emotional connection to the group due to leading it, unless his company forces him which i think they would not ( because of how much they like him, also the sure profit) he will be there</p>

      <p>It could very well end up like a Kepler situation if in some world yuehua agrees to an extension his company could still say no regardless of what he wants and they definitely have plans for him
