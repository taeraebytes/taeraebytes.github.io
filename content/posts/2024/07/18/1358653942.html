      <p>Ow, that's me. Don't block me yet because I'm not doing anything wrong to you and I'm just being honest on twit. That platform is for everyone to say anything about a topic. If my opinion of Zhang Hao is that he looks idiot, I'm not wrong because it's what I see on him. Imagine having a career in Kpop but instead of doing everything to promote yourself, you're just happy to be there. Not even trying his hardest to show how he appreciates his fans who are giving him the career that his company couldn't give him. I lurk around in this CC and other CCs too and you are all parroting the same sentiments. Well, if no one is willing to tell him what he's doing wrong, somebody should. I don't even know if he can read my chats because I can't see any improvement in how he handles himself. He's still choosing to be with his friend more than his fans and it's so obvious that he doesn't gaf about all these fan supports and awards. I still like him as an artist/idol, but he looks so dumb to me now. Nothing of substance is coming from him since april. He will fall from his glory if he doesn't gather himself and his fighting spirit. He will lose fans because he's too lazy to even do lives to talk to his fans. His fans that are blind.</p>
