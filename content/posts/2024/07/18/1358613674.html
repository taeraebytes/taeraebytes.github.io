      <p>hanbin has stronger core fanbase gyuvin might be gaining clout but not as many of them go hard for him this is evident in the fact that theyre desperately begging ifans to help pay off his mic</p>

      <p>Ricky's was that price because of the design and well having rich fans expedited the process when I heard ab gyuvins design I just knew his fans would struggle especially because his core fandom is rlly weak
