      <p>it is actually insane to me how you have their shippers be so disconnected with their personalities like you literally had Ricky self vlog show exactly who he is bougie king saying skrrr in 2024 listening to corny rnb that goes to the gym and likes basketball</p>

      <p>what kind of social media do you think ricky would be on? everyone says he would be a boba tea 04 tiktoker but i feel like he wouldnt be on there, idk he gives instagram influencer who posts videos about his glamourous lifestyle and does forex trading courses (but doesnt tell ppl his lifestlyle is not from grinding its from being a nepo baby)</p>

      <p>he's too much of an old head for tiktok he's definitely sticking to ig and probably like douyin those were the socials he used anyways but I don't see him being like that he would def be more of a quiet luxury ig lifestyle poster but he'd venture into gym content the boba 04 tiktoker is yujin it would be 07 but yea
