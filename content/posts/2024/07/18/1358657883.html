      <p>it is actually insane to me how you have their shippers be so disconnected with their personalities like you literally had Ricky self vlog show exactly who he is bougie king saying skrrr in 2024 listening to corny rnb that goes to the gym and likes basketball</p>

      <p>what kind of social media do you think ricky would be on? everyone says he would be a boba tea 04 tiktoker but i feel like he wouldnt be on there, idk he gives instagram influencer who posts videos about his glamourous lifestyle and does forex trading courses (but doesnt tell ppl his lifestlyle is not from grinding its from being a nepo baby)</p>

      <p>he's too much of an old head for tiktok he's definitely sticking to ig and probably like douyin those were the socials he used anyways but I don't see him being like that he would def be more of a quiet luxury ig lifestyle poster but he'd venture into gym content the boba 04 tiktoker is yujin it would be 07 but yea

      <p>people who have a complex abt ricky being rich will never not weird me tf out. like how are y'all different from people who fantasize him to be a trans woman sub cookie bear autist? it's lit the same just in the completely diff direction. now he's an ultra masc alpha red pill f boy? like I read someone say she shouldn't be allowed near a podcast mic here? EXCUSE ME what are we talking abt the same ricky here? and what's killing me is that NOTHING from his past would ever indicate that this is a correct characterization of him!! he had social media before bp and let me tell u he wasn't a f boy lying nepo baby. he was very inactive and barely had any pics and most of those pics were with his friends. sorry for the rant but it's been pissing me off how y'all think that just cuz y'all mischaracterizing him in the opposite direction means y'all better than all those shippers. literally doing to ricky the same thing knetz did to gunwook's image at the beginning of bp btw). sorry for the rant but god this past ccs abt ricky reminded me so much abt how 30 year old women talk abt ricky on reddit. calling him "future kris wu" and "the devil capitalist" because he said young and rich tall and handsome once ðŸ˜­ why can't ppl be normal about him. it's always either one of the extremes</p>

      <p>This is the same Ricky who would post with luxury cars  on socials it's not a defining characteristic but it's def known that he's rich with or without his bp intro he literally used to wear horrdily matched designer branded clothing in highschool and exclusively wears designer at the airports we don't even see Ricky in regular clothes outside of what he's styled in like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the podcast thing was funny but Ricky is really such a regular guy I would see him being quiet luxury on his socials and that's literally what he was. And this isn't even really comparable to gunwook because well we're joking that manifested a hate train

      <p>diff anon and damn I get y this anon ranted the way they did because ricky really is misunderstood and ppl nvr admit it but there's always double standards when it come to rich and poor ppl and unconscious stigma towards well off ppl.

It's 4am and I'm too tired to type what I really want but u can tell rickys true character when he didn't care for his ysl jacket to be passed around like a blunt in BP and we actually do see him wear his own clothes from time to time like those bts zepisodes, he wears a bunch of designer but he also re wears the same shit over and over so it means he buys things he gen values and not a one time purchase for clout and he actually takes care if the items, like I'm pretty sure I still see him wearing clothes from when he was in LA. I also find it cute he always chooses shirts or accessories with roses because yea he's quiet and doesn't talk but that's his way of showing he appreciates his fans. He's chill af and some of yall need to gen fuck off. Gn</p>

      <p>It really is 4 am for you because ur definitely taking this too serious it's jokes that obviously come from a stereotype that was picked out like do you think I'm serious when I say jiwoong beats on the younger members djnrnfnfnmgmrnvmmtmgkfkdkem I don't think anything before said really came from an unconscious stigma Ricky's just visibly rich that doesn't mean he doesn't share or that he's not a nice person I appreciate ur vigor watch that mouth but let's get you to sleep now gn
