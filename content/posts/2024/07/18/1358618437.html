      <p>Wait it was from a fs repo and someone asked him to label who is who in the family. He said hanbin is the dad, hao is the mom and Gyuvin is the friend. There were only 4 slots (1 was pet but he Xed it) but yeah they were tweaking because a lot of them try and insert jiwoong into a trio with hao and yujin and make that ‘Familyz’ even though it’s always been hanbin hao and yujin 😂</p>

      <p>the thing is gyuvin hates him but ultimately he's the one that takes after him the most so thats the important part of his arc like trying not to be a deadbeat like their dad</p>

      <p>Jiwoong realises what's truly important in life after an accident and try to reach out to his sons he sees Yujin playing basketball with Ricky and Gunwook and tries to reach out
"Got space for one more?"
But Yujin only looks at him with 
"Too little too late"
Easy to say, communication goes both way why didn't he try to reach out either?
With a sigh he hops into his car and sees gyuvin graduating, he thinks gyuvin sees him and wants to give him only to see he's going for the teacher dei hires haobin, seeing them hug, he feels his heart breaking, is it truly too late to connect with his kids?</p>
