      <p>hanbin has stronger core fanbase gyuvin might be gaining clout but not as many of them go hard for him this is evident in the fact that theyre desperately begging ifans to help pay off his mic</p>

      <p>gyuvin cfans mostly came from gyubrick shippers while hanbin's are from solo and shipper. they will start tweaking whenever gyubrick happened. good for him, yesterday shimkongz provided many moments for their ship.</p>

      <p>yeah gyujin was significantly bigger than gyubrik for a while i think i remember even seeing something on weibo a while ago that one of the main admins in his cbar is a gyujin shipper but his plan to kill that ship by pushing gyubrik has worked there was even a big led shimkongz ad near the venueðŸ˜­</p>
