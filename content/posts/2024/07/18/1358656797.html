      <p>orrr maybe the fact that he JUST met with c-zeroses and wanted a little farewell to them through weibo live? i'm not an allin fr but the whole conspiracies about hanbin having sinister intetions (if you know you know) is soooo annoying to read</p>

      <p>both of them have had ONE solo live on there and it's been a year since their debut, after a fansign in their hike country and Ricky's city and them having the most fans there if it was really about the fans they would've been the ones to do it nobody asked for yj or hb but we know what's all that about anyway.</p>
