      <p>right like they somehow find it endearing but thatâ€™s the biggest red flag when a guy canâ€™t hold a simple convo related to work staff with a women and refers to them as people with different chromosomes ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ you are not in middle school you are 20 my guy
 especially in a country where misogyny is so rampant and itâ€™s harder to find a guy whoâ€™s not a raging misogynist than a reasonable one</p>
