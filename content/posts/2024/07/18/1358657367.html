      <p>orrr maybe the fact that he JUST met with c-zeroses and wanted a little farewell to them through weibo live? i'm not an allin fr but the whole conspiracies about hanbin having sinister intetions (if you know you know) is soooo annoying to read</p>

      <p>both of them have had ONE solo live on there and it's been a year since their debut, after a fansign in their hike country and Ricky's city and them having the most fans there if it was really about the fans they would've been the ones to do it nobody asked for yj or hb but we know what's all that about anyway.</p>

      <p>Here comes rosins with there new wakeone agenda. Yes of course you must be right only Ricky and hao want to go live on Weibo no other member wants to talk to Chinese fans or give their Chinese fans an opportunity to see them ‚Äúthey are nugu in China‚Äù wdngaf. If you don‚Äôt bias them the live wasn‚Äôt for you whether it‚Äôs 1 fan or 1 million fans Chinese fans should be able to see their bias live too .</p>
