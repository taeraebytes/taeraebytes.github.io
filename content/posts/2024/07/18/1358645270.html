      <p>The favoritism it's not about the stages but about the fact that they let Hanbin mc with Yunho and Ahn Jaehyun while Sohee and Myungjae won't mc with them.</p>

      <p>Speaking of mc hanbinâ€™s 1 year will be coming up like right at the beginning of September I wonder if they will keep him because they kept miyeon for like 3 years but other mcs for only 1. Also makes me wonder if they will resign Sohee and myungjae ðŸ˜­</p>
