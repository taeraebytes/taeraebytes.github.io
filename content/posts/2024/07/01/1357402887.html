      <p>funny but unrelated. op who posted this isnâ€™t Korean and tweets in Korean all day long to seem like sheâ€™s one. I donâ€™t understand this obsession  ğŸ˜­ and i just know this because this person started with quoting every single English posts first and slowly started moving towards a more Korean troll account lol.</p>
