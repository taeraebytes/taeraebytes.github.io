      <p>zb1 got nothing going on for them except sales to which one member contributes overwhelmingly i think i'll keep being tight about this sinister injustice until wakeone and cj give my bias as much exposure and important gigs as the amount of profit he brings in like lmaooooo his tt ambassadorship alone made more money than that the zb1 hyundai collab during debut era aka their peak ðŸ’€ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>this convo is killing me because idk what they want us to do abt all this... they want us to kiss their and hao's feet for being important or drone strike wakeone to make something shake but the way they act isn't making anyone sympathetic to their situation. the rest of us have learned to accept the things we cannot change that's all we can do for yall rn</p>
