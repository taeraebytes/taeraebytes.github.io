      <p>wakeone is connected to cj and have gotta have lots of money due to all that businessy stuff so zb1 very much have label connections too. lmao i kinda dislike when zeroses act like zb1 are from a new nugu company with no investors, connections or anything, wakeone have a lot they just don't know how to use it lots of the time. zb1 could probably go to mma</p>
