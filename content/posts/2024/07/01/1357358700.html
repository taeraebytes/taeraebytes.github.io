      <p>itâ€™s really interesting because sheâ€™s doing all the moves correctly but sheâ€™s adding no groove, hardly any energy, and no facial expressions which makes it look kinda flat and lifeless ðŸ˜­ i feel like thatâ€™s how sm trains them to dance tho cuz thatâ€™s how the rest of the group dances too, super precise but no musicality</p>

      <p>Idk dance terminology but it seems like she never fully completes the moves or the energy isn't right like why does it look muddled idk the lack of presence is crazy
