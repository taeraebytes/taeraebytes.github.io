      <p>Download a shit ton of casting apps, get some experience, take portfolios and search through Facebook. It‚Äôs really easy and fun and the pay is alright, I did my first one two years ago in the Netflix movie Do revenge</p>

      <p>wait by portfolios do u mean like head shots or whatever actors do? bc i'm a diff anon but a while back i was thinking about looking into how to be an extra for shows/films for some extra money but i didn't know the process would be that complicated since ur just in the background not really doing anything and filling up space in like a crowd setting for eg üò≠ that's kinda annoying ngl lmao</p>
