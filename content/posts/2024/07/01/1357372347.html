      <p>I've been liking all OT9 and solo posts from members ever since ftp promos and I never do, I only like gunwooks and 3 other members posts but I've changed for the better. I even click like on Jiwoongs posts too even after everything he's done because I believe in good juju and this comeback that good juju will come back to us 🙏</p>
