    "question": "Kiof stans are weird, their only argument is kiof members are adults and their concepts are decided by themselves, but the youngest member became an adult this year and the way this mv is flimed even if she is not the one who is doing more sexualized choreos she is part of the group, i really don't think there is much difference between the males who profit over sexualizing female body( also waited for girls to turn 18 so that they can officially date even though they know them from when they were minors) and her older members who immediatly decided on mature concepts the moment their youngest member turns into an adult , this is just my personal opinion and well i could be wrong",
