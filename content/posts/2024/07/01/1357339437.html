      <p>diff anon but there was a post on instiz a while ago about how the artist company has to pay for everything including the backup dancers and it's like really expensive which partially explains why very few idols went on there, it also sparked a lot of controversy between fandoms over who gets selected to be on there (the companies sending whoever they like) and people speculated that's one of the reasons they discontinued the series despite it being popular at the time, that's what kfans were saying so their words not mine</p>

      <p>These companies have a lot of money they wonâ€™t mind sending idols on aotm if they could just by sending some money. Even nugu companies spend hefty amount on promos so idt itâ€™s just the money that can get an artist on aotm. I think itâ€™s more for the cb promos done on studio choom where the company pays for everything (and ofcourse they would since itâ€™s for cb promotions) apart from that i really donâ€™t think they would pay for it unless we have a defined source for it.</p>
