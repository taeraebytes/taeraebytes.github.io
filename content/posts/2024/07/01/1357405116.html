      <p>there is only one reasoning as to why they do not do lives as a group and that is because they ultimately do not fuck with eo that much at least majority of the group  sorry</p>

      <p>Gurl its the opposite üò≠ theyre so tight (except jiwoong that lying mf) that when they talk with each other theres always some inside joke and they talk with no filter because theyre comfortable with one another hence them always getting in fucking trouble cause theyre being themselves. Our group sess aint scripted and even when it is they still get in trouble because they go off script and start acting like friends cause ultimately they are friends and not co workers, like even taerae been part of the gang for awhile now.</p>
