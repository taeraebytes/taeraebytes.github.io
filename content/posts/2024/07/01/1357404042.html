      <p>funny but unrelated. op who posted this isnâ€™t Korean and tweets in Korean all day long to seem like sheâ€™s one. I donâ€™t understand this obsession  ðŸ˜­ and i just know this because this person started with quoting every single English posts first and slowly started moving towards a more Korean troll account lol.</p>

      <p>Not sure what is she but sheâ€™s def not korean, i used to argue with her and she used to ratio all the posts from the i-side but crazy how she rebranded to look like a pure korean rosin troll. I could just find this teeet from recent times where she types in English
