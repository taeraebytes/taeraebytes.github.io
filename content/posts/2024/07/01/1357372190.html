      <p>wakeone is connected to cj and have gotta have lots of money due to all that businessy stuff so zb1 very much have label connections too. lmao i kinda dislike when zeroses act like zb1 are from a new nugu company with no investors, connections or anything, wakeone have a lot they just don't know how to use it lots of the time. zb1 could probably go to mma</p>

      <p>BND has more streams than ZB1 in Melon. 😂
What category will ZB1 be nominated in MMA? It's so sad. The comeback should really do well.</p>

      <p>Ow, BND has more streams in 2024. I forgot the tracking period of MMA. If it includes Crush, we might be at better position than BND. But there's no way that we have higher digital points than Riize. ZB1 has more streams in Melon because they debuted earlier and have more songs. But in terms of digital points which are counted in MMA, Riize and BND are better than us 😭</p>

      <p>they literally don't 😭😭😭😭😭 streaming and hours spent in the top 100 zb1 have more where are u getting this info bruh never will bnd surpass zb1 hell is freezing over first.. and they might include crush since songs like perfect night and drama are still being nominated which came out before crush. But no ftp has been streamed more than impossible and bbb in their first two weeks Im pretty sure and im not counting total streams, it's always been that way because zb1 have wayyy more fans there's just no unique listeners

      <p>I know because they chart the highest I didn't say they don't have more digital points but because of zb1s much bigger fandom they have better streams. Streams on melon don't make your chart its ULs and that's what mma is looking for
