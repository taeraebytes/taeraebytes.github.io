      <p>She literally think she owns him i think, cause her previews for him during bp used to go viral and he always thanked her for it. But shes a whole sasaeng theres not a single country she hasnt been for him and yet she cant be normal on a priv or something its always on this alt acc. She WANTS him to see and also attentionseeking as she loves the praise other tr fans give her. Theyliterally call her momðŸ’©</p>
