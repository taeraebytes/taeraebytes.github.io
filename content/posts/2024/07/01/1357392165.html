      <p>I do wanna point out that kiof even tho they charted from 2024, natty went viral in korea immediately after debut. thatâ€™s why they got invited. THAT BEING SAID, idk why ppl are tweaking about this award show thingy, they donâ€™t have lots of famous 5th gen male groups, zb1 will be invited dw</p>

      <p>zb1 is still very famous just not #1 so I don't see why they wouldn't go and while it was dhit they did chart for a couple of hours for both sweat and ftp plus got 4 new wins like we're fine

      <p>i remember when kiof got invited i thought they were in the lineup to fill in fifty fifty's space since they had that scandal and definitely would've gone if that whole thing never happened.... to think fifty fifty was basically banished from getting roty wow like idc about them but it was just crazy to witness bc of how huge cupid was</p>
