      <p>Download a shit ton of casting apps, get some experience, take portfolios and search through Facebook. It’s really easy and fun and the pay is alright, I did my first one two years ago in the Netflix movie Do revenge</p>

      <p>It depends honestly if you’re like a regular extra it can be like 90-120 ish but if you’re a special extra (like an extra that does stunts like cheerleading for example) then you get 170-220 ish</p>
