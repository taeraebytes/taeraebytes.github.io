      <p>Have you seen the intl conspiracies with ftp? They saying Sweat was supposed to be the tt but then fuckass max came by and stupid ass wakeone thought he was some kind of higher being white dude that'll bless us with chart results so wakeone decided to switch last minute and make ftp the tt instead hence why the members during comeback prep season were saying things like they don't know whats going on etc.</p>

      <p>nah ftp was the intended tt I feel like the songs were completely recorded by Jan they filmed sweat first in a much simpler manner in the beginning of March then ftp recording came later. The members also talked a lot about how they fought for sweat to be a prerelease not to mention intl fans aren't rmbring or just understand the actual massacre that was sweat no way a song with jiwoong in the top 3 most lines and one of the main vocalist and the center in the bottom 3 ever gonna be a ttðŸ˜­....

      <p>Also like queef said Jiwoong being top 3 in lines ?!! No way Sweat was gonna be the title track. I know Wakeone stupid but they aint that stupid knowing that the Korean gp literally hates his ass to blatantly sabotage us like that. 

Intl fans are just stupid they refuse to acknowledge how big of a controversy Jiwoong's scandal actually was and how badly it affected our domestic fandom. Intl fans always bring up rice scandals and but unlike rice, their scandals were personal affairs and doesn't affect the idol and fan relationship, like you can be a shitty person but still have fan support. But Jiwoong literally cursed at his die hard fan, the very fan that made it possible for idols to be idols. Omfg I'm getting pissed just writing this but fuck Jiwoong. Can't believe for the millionth time were in the shitters because of him, him who already debuted, him who is the oldest that fucked it up for the other 8.</p>

      <p>Wait but let's calculate since no one has done producing or lyrical work in zb1 they probably all get the same salary at first but Hao probably has the most plus chat subs and overall sales and haobin have the most gigs while jiwoong gets basically none, we don't know what is the artist cut with plus chat or amongst the company but I feel like Hanbin should get a decent amount of money considering his relationship with his company they must treat him like a king ðŸ¤”do brands pay them btw</p>
