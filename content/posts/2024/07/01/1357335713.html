      <p>I do wanna point out that kiof even tho they charted from 2024, natty went viral in korea immediately after debut. thatâ€™s why they got invited. THAT BEING SAID, idk why ppl are tweaking about this award show thingy, they donâ€™t have lots of famous 5th gen male groups, zb1 will be invited dw</p>

      <p>zb1 is still very famous just not #1 so I don't see why they wouldn't go and while it was dhit they did chart for a couple of hours for both sweat and ftp plus got 4 new wins like we're fine
