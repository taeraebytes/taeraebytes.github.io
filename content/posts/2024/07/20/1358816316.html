      <p>In korea, after byun wooseok scandal where his bodygaurds did too much at the airport, there is a petition trying to pass a law  against celebrities using airports as a public place. So i dont think it stops ssgs but it will stop sponsorships and planned media shoots at the airport, bc it affects normal citzens on a daily basis. What do you think</p>
