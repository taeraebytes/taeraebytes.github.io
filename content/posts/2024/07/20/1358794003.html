 this is some king shit tbh.. ik we were just talking about how ricky is perceived by fans (though it was more like femininity vs masculinity) but, and i'm saying this as someone who ignores fans like the plague so i wouldn't know, i feel like with all the mistreatment stuff going on with him ppl might interpret him as really weak and submissive bc fans of all ppl love that type of narrative but i hope they don't and if they do that this at least let's them know he's strong as hell bc i thought this was interesting to read</p>

      <p>Yeppp 100% we had a conversation about how people thought Ricky has low body autonomy or smth ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and I feel like there's another repo from a whiiile ago where he said smth similar and I always felt it was obvious that he's an unbothered kinda guy like I guess the convo ur bringing ups how his fans think he's barred from everything against his will? and I always felt like he did things on his own but I rlly liked this interview I read other translations

      <p>ooo I think the low autonomy thing started because in fansigns they'd ask members to rank their autonomy? or something and ricky would always be last like even yujin would rank him last but I think ppl/ members just misunderstood him ðŸ˜­ and same like he always just gave me the unbothered vibe and it's clear his opinions aren't easily swayed by ppl and I think he also just doesn't confront ppl when their opinions is different than his so than that person would assume since he isnt fighting back that he's 'submitting' to them but he just dgaf enough to argue with them ðŸ˜­ 

also is there links to his other interview its really interesting because this is something I actually expecting him to say nvm imma just scroll that acc they prob translated other parts im assuming</p>
