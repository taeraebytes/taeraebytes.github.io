      <p>hao having another boyfriend makes sense. he has the best cover up within the group (same with hb). hao is mostly the one spilling the most and doing the most for the ship, he obviously would have to benefit from it somehow. im not saying they are not close friends, cause they def are but i really do believe that hao has a boyfriend outside of the group. hao and hb are very professional people, they wouldnt actually date the other. combining this with hbs alleged boyfriend during crush era going live and talking about hb and hb writing "are you cold?" it all just makes sense.</p>
