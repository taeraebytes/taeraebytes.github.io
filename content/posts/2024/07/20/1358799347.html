      <p>Queef Why are you so picky with your cc posts? You only post stuff that channels animosity against Hanbin, Yujin, and Jiwoong while ignoring any negative posts about Hao, Gunwook, and Matthew. I tried this experiment to figure it out: I purposefully left mildly unpleasant comments about each member; you skipped Hao, Gunwook, and Matthew, but you instantly jumped on Hanbin, Yujin, and Jiwoong posts. Why are you trying to be Ot9 zerose?</p>
