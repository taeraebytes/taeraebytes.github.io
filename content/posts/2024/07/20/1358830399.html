      <p>TW: DATING TALK
do y'all sometimes can tell when a member is dating? they always have certain look in their eyes like they know something we don't, gyuvin always have that look and same with yujin, gunwook had it from november to february, hanbin had it at debut and jiwoong always looks crazy so I wouldn't know, they also act a little different coz some of them start indulging a lot in the gf fanservice to overcompensate or they stop communicating with fans as often as they used to, idk I feel like with normal people it's easy to tell when they're dating and I'm also super nosy so I wanna know who in zb1 would be a serial dater or smth like that</p>

      <p>itâ€™s not about his pre debut pictures and we alr know he had 2 exes, there was something else recently about a month ago and c- rosins were mass tweaking and itâ€™s not about the choreographer you got the haobinists in your cc tweaking already ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>The account got suspended but Iâ€™m pretty sure it was the choreographer who got caught putting his hand up the back of haoâ€™s shirt in a zepisode and that schizo rosin who ships him with anyone found his insta and found out it he only liked haoâ€™s pics on the zb1 account</p>
