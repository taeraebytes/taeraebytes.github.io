      <p>wow this is just another level of schizo atp. can akgaes not make everything about zb1? the way they talk, it's like a hate tweet for the izna girlies. this is not even about zb1, its because izna is facing the incompetence under wakeone and they say this shit that does not have the correlation about the izna visa issue?

      <p>this is actually insane because it's obvious these people don't know anything ab visas kcon and wakeone shouldn't have announced their presence at kcon cuz it was never gonna happen them not securing an artist visa to enter america makes sense especially in the short time frame they've given themselves 😭😭and they quite literally got stricter
