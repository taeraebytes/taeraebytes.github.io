      <p>The favoritism it's not about the stages but about the fact that they let Hanbin mc with Yunho and Ahn Jaehyun while Sohee and Myungjae won't mc with them.</p>

      <p>Speaking of mc hanbinâ€™s 1 year will be coming up like right at the beginning of September I wonder if they will keep him because they kept miyeon for like 3 years but other mcs for only 1. Also makes me wonder if they will resign Sohee and myungjae ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I think theyâ€™ll let them go i dont think both at once since its obvious. But i know they really want Hb it seems he makes great connections too, im actually jealous of that he really connects with ppl esp those way senior. And it will help you in the future the thing is i get tooo much anxiety ðŸ˜­ But i guess it helps he has a lott of experience with performing and that kpop degree will come in CLUTCH</p>

      <p>It's about time they were the worst mc partners in history honestly you just gotta put urself in uncomfortable situations for connections like it's for you so do the most if you can I hunt all my professors and stuff down for experience
