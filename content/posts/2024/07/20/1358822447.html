      <p>How was hanbin weird?? Gunwook is the one who brought Hanbin up and said Parkbinie hyung looks after him and he often contacts him for tips on facial expressions when performing. Hanbin has literally never brought gunwook up once</p>

      <p>That's literally not what he said, he said that gunwook was hyping him up the day before the finale and telling him that he was going to debut, but then gunwook's name was called instead of his. You're literally just making shit up because you hate him lol</p>
