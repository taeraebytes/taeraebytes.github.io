      <p>can chinese fans not act like any member other than hao yujin Ricky is a stain under their shoe? we get it your faves are them three cheer a bit for the others too, this is why whenever they go to japan and western countries (probably sea countries too we will see) it is so much better because even the least popular member gets cheers</p>
