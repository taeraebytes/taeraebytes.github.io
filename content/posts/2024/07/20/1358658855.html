      <p>Immediately after you shared it it got 32 qrt lmaoo but they have a very consistent amount of likes on each post interesting and honestly I have a solid guess about who it is based on the writing style but I don't want to accuse anyone in vain lol
But there's this rosin akgae account that was bordering on Hao anti during Jeju when she realised it was his choice, calling him stupid and saying she hates him a little, she had about 1k followers but it flew under the radar, writing style is very similar idk if anyone made the same observation</p>

      <p>You hate honest people eh. You only know how to praise your faves? I don't. I like his music and artistry but he's becoming lazy and dumb af. Not appreciating what his fans are doing for him when even stoic Ricky knows how to do it. He's becoming worse than Jiwoong</p>
