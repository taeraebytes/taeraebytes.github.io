      <p>TW: DATING TALK
do y'all sometimes can tell when a member is dating? they always have certain look in their eyes like they know something we don't, gyuvin always have that look and same with yujin, gunwook had it from november to february, hanbin had it at debut and jiwoong always looks crazy so I wouldn't know, they also act a little different coz some of them start indulging a lot in the gf fanservice to overcompensate or they stop communicating with fans as often as they used to, idk I feel like with normal people it's easy to tell when they're dating and I'm also super nosy so I wanna know who in zb1 would be a serial dater or smth like that</p>
