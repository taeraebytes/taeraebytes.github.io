 we're literally seeing his mandible bone grow and develop in real time and in other pics u can see his tzone developing slowly. He's 17 rn I think? and it's prime time for facial growth in boys esp lower jaw and tzone and he'll probably keep looking 'diff' until he's 20 when the testosterone calms down but right now 15-18/19 will be the most noticeable/ biggest change and is completely natural cause it's puberty.

ofc if suddenly in the future his mandible bone is gone then yeah he got ps to shave it off but it's clearly growing rn and his other features are growing in too. by the way things are looking hes gonna look like a handsome fella</p>
