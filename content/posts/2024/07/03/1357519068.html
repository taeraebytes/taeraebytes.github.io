      <p>there's no ricky's pubg repo. he is really nugu in korea or k-zerose didn't wanna talk about him?? even rukidans big account didn't care about his pubg whereabout. lol. his preview also usually came late than other member, has less fansite on fansign. it's only pic he didn't have video from fansign unless it's cp fans/fs</p>

      <p>Streets saying his team won 1st so they're prob gatekeeping the results to not spoil future content but here I am spoiling 😭 Also anon sounds like a straight up Ricky hater and if this is how you talk on twt you're probably just blocked by most Ricky stan accs so that's why you aint seeing shit because there's plenty of non shipping fansign stuff from him. lol.

Like the sarcastic ass .lol is pissing me off and I'm not even his stan 😭 I go hard on that riwook crumbs tho 🤓👆</p>
