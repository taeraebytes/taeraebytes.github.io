      <p>I don't like when you guys talk about my friends when you don't know nothing can u stop.. she didn't beg me for anything she wanted to create a space for rosins to talk freely and it got too negative nobody wants to spend their stan experience in a constant state of upset so she chose her peace üòë I operate simply because I talk too much and have a knack for arguing not to mention I've been gossip centered more than anything leave my sister alone

      <p>tbh good for her for knowing her boundaries and queefs right because dont u guys rmb that confession from an akgae article or w.e? OP said all they did was complain about their bias whether its lack of schedules, lack of lines or lack of screentime etc and constantly comparing their bias to other members and hating on the other members when they get more lines, gigs etc to the point stanning their bias no longer became enjoyable because now its just all negativity and competition so they eventually unstanned. Pretty sure all the rosin akgaes how lurked here went to hers üò≠ 

like its not even about 'she couldnt handle it' when its not even about gossip or conversations anymore and just straight up shade, hate and negativity. I'd bounce too.</p>
