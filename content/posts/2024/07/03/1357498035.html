      <p>was it ever explained why yujin wasn't in the majority of the first busan show episode?????? i was so confused when i realised he wasn't partaking in the quiz and flag games, then the producer mentioned something about yujin going on a new team and swapping members around and then suddenly he's with taerae and hao doing the photo thing? i don't think he did inkigayo when they went to busan and idk if he went to school</p>

 he wasnt feeling good/ sick and they swapped jiwoong with yuj because 'apparently' minors couldnt go to where gunrick were going but I call bs cause it was a typical foodmarket like since when did u need to be an adult to go to a market ðŸ˜­ I just think hao didnt fuck with jiwoong and it was gonna be awkward with hao taerae and jiwoong</p>
