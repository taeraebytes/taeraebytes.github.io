      <p>was it ever explained why yujin wasn't in the majority of the first busan show episode?????? i was so confused when i realised he wasn't partaking in the quiz and flag games, then the producer mentioned something about yujin going on a new team and swapping members around and then suddenly he's with taerae and hao doing the photo thing? i don't think he did inkigayo when they went to busan and idk if he went to school</p>
