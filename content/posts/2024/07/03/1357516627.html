      <p>i dont think natty looks that different from before tbh if you look at her in her first solo era especially teddy bear era she just looks like she lost a bunch of weight and got a few procedures idk i cant pinpoint what probably something with her nose but her face looks mostly the same i can still recognise her from that time</p>
