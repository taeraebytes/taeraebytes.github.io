      <p>?? Wdym it currently has less than half the views of the sweat mv and more likes but that doesnâ€™t make the sweat mv views botted does it ?ðŸ˜­ like Iâ€™ve been an admin for a previous groups fanbase before and when we did yt ads for the comeback we raised $5000 for ads and it only got us around 300k views, aotm has its own niche of viewers and the clips from it did really well on twt and the likes actually match up to a lot of the previous aotm too. The closest in views is sinb and hers has 5.4 million with 236k likes hanbinâ€™s has 6.2 million and 287k likes.</p>
