      <p>That's surprising cause he's the only member I find actually very ugly like imo he's the only visual hole in the group, I've always liked his personality and he always sings live plus can dance so no hate</p>

      <p>I think we just have different tastes tbh cause for ex I think every riize member is better looking than zb1 members on average I also find Mingyu super good looking but I find Matthew very ugly and I don't see the hype in haobinjin I still like zb1 way more as a whole group tho</p>
