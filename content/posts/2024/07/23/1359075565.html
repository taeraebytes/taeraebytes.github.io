      <p>They did buy ads which isn’t unusual for aotm but even then the ads ran after a couple hours and I’d say based on how much they raised only generated 200-300k views it also depends what else is dropping at the same time like if other big or popular videos are dropping it’s going to be harder for it to trend. Also I’ve never heard of views being botted yt is extremely rigid in that and if there were attempts of that just like we’ve seen many times before with mass streaming there would have been a massive view freeze or drop and that hasn’t happened as of now.</p>
