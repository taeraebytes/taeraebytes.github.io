      <p>?? Wdym it currently has less than half the views of the sweat mv and more likes but that doesn’t make the sweat mv views botted does it ?😭 like I’ve been an admin for a previous groups fanbase before and when we did yt ads for the comeback we raised $5000 for ads and it only got us around 300k views, aotm has its own niche of viewers and the clips from it did really well on twt and the likes actually match up to a lot of the previous aotm too. The closest in views is sinb and hers has 5.4 million with 236k likes hanbin’s has 6.2 million and 287k likes.</p>

      <p>frombaseone did an ad support for feel the pop for $2000 and it got us around 1.2m views so its likely that most of the views from hanbins aotm is from ads too</p>

      <p>I feel like ads are hit or miss, you can get your money‘s worth but then sometimes also not so it depends</p>
