      <p>youtube trends works like itunes you need a lot of people watching with different IPs in order to trend and with that amount of views in 24 hours it would have made it to least top 50 just like every aotm but it didn’t so i guess it’s kind of botted</p>

      <p>I'm not sure who else was contributing but from what I'm told the amt of views shbg could raise if they ran all their ads at once is about 400k for 4K USD so the amt it got majority would have to be real esp since it didn't freeze so idky it didn't trend it could be because of that or smth else I have no clue ab this kinda stuff im just trynna hear everyone out
