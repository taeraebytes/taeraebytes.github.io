      <p>Wonbin and giselle dating rumours have been going around for a while and Han Seo hee have brought it up recently she said heâ€™s dating giselle for her money which reminded me of a tarot reading on wonbin posted on tumblr, they said he would choose a partner richer than him cuz he wants to be a sugar baby getting pampered and taken care of while giving his body in return heâ€™s kinda messy for that ðŸ˜­</p>
