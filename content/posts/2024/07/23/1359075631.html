      <p>That's surprising cause he's the only member I find actually very ugly like imo he's the only visual hole in the group, I've always liked his personality and he always sings live plus can dance so no hate</p>

      <p>he is and I think overall standards matter like in America Sohees popular and considered cute same with Matthew the standards are less harsh me personally I used to find him cute too till I saw him irl and I used to find Matthew regular till I saw him irl as well but definitely sohee has wayyyyyyy better styling it serves him pretty well

      <p>Yeah I didn't see either group irl so I can't really give a realistic opinion ultimately I really like the styling for riize much more than zb1 and imo that plays a lot in looks (except Ricky he can dress) but I can see how for example how hanbin is objectively more good looking when they mc together</p>
