      <p>They did raise $4000 for ads but it wouldn’t have generated more than 400k in views and it also depends if they ran the ads all at once or over a week or so. Trends also happen when you manually search for it and share links ect, I know in a previous fandom we would be told to manually search and share mv so that it would enter the trends but you have to be quite organised for that especially if you want it to enter the local trend</p>
