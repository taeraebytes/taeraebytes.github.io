      <p>trainee and artist contracts are different yes but we don't know the terms or if they're signed under different contracts with their respective companies. And like people think it'll probably take a lotttt for yuehua to give up hao

      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>
