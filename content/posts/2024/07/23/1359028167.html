      <p>when abouts are zb1 leaving for america???? bc i feel like if it is on his birthday or just before that and they're in america at that time then they may announce a birthday live either for tomorrow or the day after, meaning a tweet for that would happen tonight or tomorrow 🤔 lowkey need that bc i'm bored</p>
