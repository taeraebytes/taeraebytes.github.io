      <p>catching up on ccs and got to ppl talking about wanting to see zb1 do fun content and LMAO i actually don't think zb1 can do all that much bc of the state of their fanbase like i was watching the insomnia zero going seventeen episodes recently and the members were going innnnnnnnn which is partly bc they've known each other for so long but like while i was watching i was thinking that if zb1 did anything close to that every single subfandom would order a truck outside wakeone a minute after upload like it's no wonder everything is boring and scripted down</p>

      <p>NRNTNNFNFNNDMGNNDMFNFM idol human theatre being our preview to that but I mean it makes sense zb1 don't have a family image or a totally united fandom smth like that definitely isn't goingðŸ˜­ but it's cool we can rip off other fun stuff

      <p>anon u cant be serious right ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ zb1 isnt the only group to have akgaes and when have u ever seen trucks for a situation like that, in or outside zb1??? based on what i watch i dont think they still have the heart to do disses like how some of my old biases did in public, but they can definitely have banter comfortably...</p>

      <p>They're exaggerating they mean everyone would be upset like idol human theatre was a little preview it really was but I agree they can still have nice banter and they're interesting
