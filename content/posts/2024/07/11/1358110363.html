 and I think he prob has a 'home' in shanghai but not his 'home' home so he doesn't consider it as his cause prob like anon said its his grandparents home or it could be a really close relative they just left all their junk at when they moved to america ðŸ˜­ and his LA home is actually his parents so he considers it his home home.</p>
