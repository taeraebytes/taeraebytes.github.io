      <p>Ive seen some says that it helps to prevent nipple chafing. You know, he is dancing and do a lot of activities where he moves a lot and he has kinda sensitive skin so maybe that's the reasons why. Also knowing the fact that he is an active dancer maybe he used it even before pre debut. Tape nips for men usually used by some male athletes esp a runner. And I have seen some k idols also used it (Im a kpop fan for 8yrs). Just like what I have saw a while ago too that baekhyun also used it. It was captured since from the photo he is wearing smthg that has slit in his chest so when he moves the tape nips was shown. Its totally for self care so it makes sense</p>
