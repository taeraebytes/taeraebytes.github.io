      <p>Ok I asked about the villa earlier but found it it's actually not that expensive it's between three hundred and four hundred dollars with two floors two bedrooms one jacuzzi and one private pool with the sea not too far away honestly a steal, I do know hanbin apparently bought a studio to his sister tho so I'm guessing they're upper middle class or lower upper class rn I don't think they are rich yet</p>

      <p>sorry I got to it late. WAITTTTT wtf that's so cheap like 400 a night or 400 total but the cost of living in korea is a lot cheaper compared to what I'm used to so I'd say they're def upper middle class
