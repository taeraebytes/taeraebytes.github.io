      <p>Another thing about the hao2binz blog is that their first place only had one room where they all slept together but then they showed that Hanbin bought them a way bigger and nicer accomodation wakeone are sooo greedy like clearly the boys have the money so they must have more and they couldn't even book something with two rooms</p>
