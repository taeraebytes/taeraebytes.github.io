    "question": "Theres 2 diffrent ways to rent in Korea called jeonse and wolse. Jeonse is what most people do and the most popular way to rent and this is where you put a hugeee amount of money down as a deposit ($500k - $1m for a nice Seoul apartment) but then you donâ€™t pay any monthly rent and you get the money back when you move out. Thatâ€™s a crazy amount people usually donâ€™t have so people usually take a loan to do this renting style because the interest rate on the loan is way  less than the monthly rent cost would have been in the wolse renting system. You still have to have money to put down though because the bank will only give you up to 80% of the deposit and only up to $350k I believe.

They still put down a big deposit (not as big as cheonse renting system) and then also pay monthly rent. And the obvious utilities too. You can negotiate deposit and monthly rent in this system so less deposit for more monthly rent or more deposit for less monthly rent so this may work better for some who canâ€™t get a loan or donâ€™t have enough lumpsom for the cheonse system.",

      <p>Ok I asked about the villa earlier but found it it's actually not that expensive it's between three hundred and four hundred dollars with two floors two bedrooms one jacuzzi and one private pool with the sea not too far away honestly a steal, I do know hanbin apparently bought a studio to his sister tho so I'm guessing they're upper middle class or lower upper class rn I don't think they are rich yet</p>
