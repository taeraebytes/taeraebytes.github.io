      <p>Another thing about the hao2binz blog is that their first place only had one room where they all slept together but then they showed that Hanbin bought them a way bigger and nicer accomodation wakeone are sooo greedy like clearly the boys have the money so they must have more and they couldn't even book something with two rooms</p>

      <p>Oh so did they all room together in the place that wk1 rented them and then 2binz roomed together in the place that Hanbin rented them? These 2binz truthers and Haobinists all saying something different and now Iâ€™m confused about the room situation ðŸ˜­</p>
