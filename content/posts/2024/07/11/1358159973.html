      <p>I feel like some anons gen want us to flop like it gets them off stanning a nugu group and I noticed this for a long time, whenever a member or the group goes viral there's a few anons that try to discredit it and saying it doesn't matter because of this and that instead of hyping them up. I don't think its a subfandom jealousy thing either because like I said they be saying the same with when the group does achieve something. 

So it's either a kink of these anons to stan nugu group and don't want success or projection because they're unsuccessful irl so they want their group to be unsuccessful as well and when they do gain some bit of success they try to diminish it or even try to sabotage it.</p>
