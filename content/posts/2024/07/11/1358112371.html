      <p>Omfg its so bad and to summarize she was in a relationship and it started getting violent then when she tried to break up he'd threaten to leak their cextape from hidden cameras, she didn't even know she was filmed so then she stayed with him and its been almost 4 years ish and she's been getting assaulted almost everyday during those 4 years while she was doing mukbangs and in some vids u can see bruise marks on her arms. 

Employees found out and tried to help tzuyang but hed only just beat her in front of them and break all their equipment and then tzuyang was like I can take it anymore and promised to give him all her money and he left, I think? but then came back and said it's not enough and threatened to kill her family and started making up lies about her to other youtubers. She finally filed a domestic abuse lawsuit and it went public and he committed suicide. Coward.
