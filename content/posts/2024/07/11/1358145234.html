      <p>I lowkey think it could be a possibility and I think those chances go up a lot if they yuehuaz in evnne decide to stay there. Because realistically everyone knows yuehuas Korean management is ass like they are so bad at managing their group and that ultimately is what kills the momentum of a lot of them. Also if hao and Ricky make in clear they want to stay and work in Korea and not China (which I feel
Most people know yuehua will want them in China) then again it may be more beneficial to have a joint sort of management thing because ultimately they are still pulling in nearly 50% of the profits from zb1 so it’s not like they are loosing out and even though they aren’t in the company it’s still the most successful group they have had in ages and probably where they are making the most money. They could risk killing the momentum of the yuehuaz by pulling them if their management is bad. So it may be more beneficial to leave them in zb1.</p>

      <p>Yea I think it just comes down to if they think they can make more with the members if they take them back (they won't) and if they'd rather just have full control
