      <p>I don't think you know what kind of money is needed for a black card..... and most likely the first part of zb1s revenue went to WAKEONE DEBT😭

      <p>My moms got black card and idk if it works the same for diffrent countries and diffrent banks but for 99% of them at least it’s strictly invite only and your have to be pulling in a couple hundred thousand a year to a million to even be eligible for an offer. So as someone who only started getting paid at the end of last year (per the members words) it’s definitely not a black card.</p>
