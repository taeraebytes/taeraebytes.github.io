      <p>Excuse me?? I am an allin but no one is calling Matthew a leech. It was some of Jiwoong fans as far as I remember. In fact, we are laughing at them because its clearly a tease and hanbin didn't  even get affected by that. Tbh, it maybe because matthew misses their old times hanging out with just the 2 of them and went to places that they used to go.  

I hope Req will show thisü´∂</p>

      <p>That was from ages ago?? And that was from agkae? Like every sf has that kind of fans so wtvr. Its the same from seokryu sides if I am being honest (roasting hanbin). Its just the same. And that tweet about those plushies as far as I remember is from priv acc with just a single number of like but it blew up when some moot of that priv reveals it to tl. And everyone involves themselves instead of doing rnb, the reason why matthew probably saw it. 

When I say Allins, means the general of us not some agkaes on our sf. Matthew is well loved as we appreciate the friendship he has with hanbin. And I am an Allin since bp. I just know how to act sane and like a real fan who can appreciate idols. I pushed myself to be OT9 but this fandom sucks and for them biasing hanbin means solo and agkae before. I am a kpop fan for so long and this is the most annoying fandom I have encountered (majority are solos, followed by agkae and the least were ot9). This reality makes me sad because the reason why jebies probably losing fans is because of the fandom we haveüò≠</p>

      <p>I rmbr this event pretty clearly while yes it was akgaes but the akgae community used to be really large and leaked into fan spaces all the time it was more than just one post it was many many public posts with lots of likes. I appreciate ur input and it's nice but we were all seeing how things would go down back then they've changed but it was definitely more than just one person more than a private and more than just akgaes in their echo chamber

      <p>You are 100% right and you should say it. Some people fr are rewriting history. I was active on social media then and that situation was BADDDD. Like it was multiple big accounts (hopefully they aren‚Äôt still active) bc allin akgae accs used to pull huge numbers. (To be fair, several gained a lot of their following before they became akgaes). But they still had huge reach. 

And like ppl said, Matthew saw it and retired the doll asap :/

Also Taerae ifans got hit tweets out of the situation Lol. They were saying stuff like thank goodness Taerae didn‚Äôt get a doll so he won‚Äôt be whacked by stupid akgaes

Life would have been a lot better then if akgaes actually kept ALL their shit on priv and in dms/gcs.</p>
