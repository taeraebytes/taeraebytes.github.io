      <p>Excuse me?? I am an allin but no one is calling Matthew a leech. It was some of Jiwoong fans as far as I remember. In fact, we are laughing at them because its clearly a tease and hanbin didn't  even get affected by that. Tbh, it maybe because matthew misses their old times hanging out with just the 2 of them and went to places that they used to go.  

I hope Req will show thisü´∂</p>
