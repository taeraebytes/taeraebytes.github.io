      <p>It was basically confirmed because Matthew said he lives with Ricky (and the manager Iâ€™m guessing) Taerae Yujin and Gunwook share a floor and Iâ€™m guessing their extra room came from a manager moving out and hao2binz share so itâ€™s like confirmed he donâ€™t live with them ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>no ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I think they've learned to keep jiwoong at a respectable shelved status while not fully alienating him from the group or putting him on hiatus. Like for what he gets and does none of it bothers me and I think it'll stay that way tbh
