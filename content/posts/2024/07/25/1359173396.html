      <p>sometimes I think Zb1 is cursed.. like Jiwoong fainting during their debut showcase, Gyuvin getting an eye problem right at the start of award season, always against big groups during their album releases THERE IS AN EVIL EYE</p>

Crush same tracking week as skz and aespa

Ftp we were almost in the clear bc aespa announced late May early on but then did a prerelease the same day (has paks like nobody else would be winning against them either)
