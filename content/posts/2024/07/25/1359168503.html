      <p>Whenever content like this is released i always wonder what do akgaes think like I know they're tapped in the head and just ignore but like what do they really think like do they suddenly think oh damn maybe the people I've been calling fat and ugly really do love my bias 🤔🤔</p>

        <div class="media"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/SLRugiJNo_4AAAAC/m4rkdoll.gif"/></div>first and foremost the attempt at a gag was weak let's try it again and second there's a difference between being an akgae (hating the whole group because of your bias) and disliking jiwoong (a distant member who quite literally brought the downfall of his group). Most of these people here wouldn't have disliked him if it wasn't for that FACT.. akgaes make up and twist things in their head and for the most part jiwoong gets ignored because he makes it so easy.... he doesn't interact with this fans... or the members... he doesn't live with them... his biggest bit is having a Tom and Jerry relationship with yujin that he takes too far that it gets weird.. he fulfills almost zero role in the group even just being the eldest hyung.. Now I've never tried twisting his words and painting him as less than when he tries to be genuine there's no wrong in giving him credit where it's due and for the most part I'm alright with him I've gotten over the irreversible damage and the future of the group it'll forever be compromised and it won't change. Idk what u thought this was but try this elsewhere there's so much that goes into the jiwoong thing plus he has been unreliable and lied a bunch but hey he only gets discussed when things spark up you rlly tried it lmfaooooooooooo OH AND LEMME NOT FORGET none of us ignore him in content if he interacts with a member it gets talked ab u just lied 😭😭😭😭😭
