Now I've never tried twisting his words and painting him as less than when he tries to be genuine there's no wrong in giving him credit where it's due and for the most part I'm alright with him I've gotten over the irreversible damage and the future of the group it'll forever be compromised and it won't change. Idk what u thought this was but try this elsewhere there's so much that goes into the jiwoong thing plus he has been unreliable and lied a bunch but hey he only gets discussed when things spark up you rlly tried it lmfaooooooooooo OH AND LEMME NOT FORGET none of us ignore him in content if he interacts with a member it gets talked ab u just lied 😭😭😭😭😭"
