      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group they’d push out 😭</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him 💔

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>diff anon i think it would be interesting if ricky started acting post disbandment like solo doesn't necessarily have to mean music but we'll see what he's interested in</p>

      <p>Damn I didn’t see it before but that anon said rosins will really compare everything between hanbin and hao was really onto something 😭 anon what fucking crack are you on it wasn’t about hanbin being the first mc win they just wanted hanbin to give zb1 a win because the other mcs have given their groups a win too that’s so normal. Also what did hao being the mubank mc have to do with zb1 winning, zb1 were already locked in for the win before his mc announcement even dropped.</p>

      <p>no because right after hao was announced as special mc, rosins started trolling saying that hanbin has been an mc for 8 months in mcd but couldn't give zb1 a trophy while hao is only mcing for 1 day in music bank and about to be the 1st zb1 member to give them the trophy so allins started wishing for an MCountdown miracle</p>

      <p>honestly we could've done well for crush there was just no organization WAKEONE DIDNT SHIP 400k ALBUMS SO NO PHYSICALS.... and I don't think their broadcast points were as good and their socmed points were shit from a butt.... it sucks cuz that was when our digitals were still good but yea we had a decent chance this time around supernova was just too strong digitally 🤦‍♀️
