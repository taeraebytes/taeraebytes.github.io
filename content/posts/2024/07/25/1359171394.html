 ok ignore the first pic but the second oneâ€¦.. idk enough about planes and all the classes is that like a private plane or first class or something?????? the first pic is from when they were in the pool at the hotel for tmea so i wouldâ€™ve thought the second pic would be from then too but thereâ€™s no way in hell zb1 are going on a private plane/first class (unless he just was able to pose in that part of the plane for some reason which is highly unlikely) so would this be from his trip to shanghai when they had a break????? thatâ€™s crazy lmao</p>

      <p>let me give my working class opinion because I must speak the plane pic def seems like it's from his own trip not the groups they always fly business. hmmm I wanna say this looks private it's definitely first class but it reminds me of celeb photo ops even the famous fake private plane background it just looks soooo much like it. Like I know people who come from millionaires and they always fly first class so it wouldn't be too surprising if he flew private although I have no idea how it works lollllll side note his body teaaaaaaaaaaaaa
