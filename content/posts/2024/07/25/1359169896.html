      <p>this kinda kills me bc they just straight up ignored Suzy and asked to take a pic with him or how did that happen bc i know bogum and hanbin took a bunch of pics during MAMA after party but I don't think they are close with each other for them to just be casually talking and then taking a pic</p>

      <p>Taerae took a pic with him bc they performed together in Belgium and couldn't take a pic back then, I don't know what the rest was doing there but I'm pretty sure bogum was reposting the pic with Taerae because they performed together and because both of them were casted by the same person</p>
