      <p>Yh and hybe have actually pretty tight relationships on the low but I don't think they'd be down to give Hao at all, I'm not sure Hao will stay tho, the only reason yibo is staying is cause he has shares in the company</p>

      <p>I could see them vying for Yujin but hao is way to old for hybe like even Yujin would be the oldest in any new group they‚Äôd push out üò≠</p>

      <p>There's the Sakura example and well there is a difference between their situations there's just not a universe where yuehua are giving up hao I could possibly see that happening for yujin but I don't want that for him üíî

      <p>wait that one tarot reading that said the one who would part ways with yuehua and go solo would probably not have it good post disbandment i think thats ricky? since hao is most likely staying and yujin probably in another group</p>

      <p>anon I think u just dont get him, I think theres a clear line when it comes to acquaintances and friends to him and hes just the type to have 3 friends and be totally happy and u can clearly tell who his friends are in the group but doesnt mean he dislikes the other members and dont talk or joke around with them</p>

      <p>Right I I think his relationships with the members are cute they don't all have to be his bffs but they get on well and esp for the amt of time they've known each other it's comfortable

      <p>Imo for Ricky's relationships
Jiwoong - doesn't like it's not deep he just doesn't 
Hao- chill with but I don't think they'll ever be close friends 
Hanbin- same as Hao
Matthew - likes, could casually keep contact w
Gyuvin - best friend but needs some healthy distance
Gunwook- really likes, could casually keep contact w
Yujin- close friend</p>

      <p>yeah I think they all just came to terms with the damage jiwoong caused because no matter how much they despise him he still gonna be in the group so might as well make the atmosphere pleasant and who knows maybe knets will switch up seeing them trying to move forward in a positive light rather than holding onto the past. hopefully the 8 members can gain some pity fans

I do have a theory tho, I feel like members who lurk deep on the kside who seen all those forum posts and k tweets/ memes prob dont hate him but are distancing themselves from him like gyuvin and hanbin. I'm not shading those two because I would too</p>

      <p>ngl I don't think any of them seemed obviously mad after the scandal their relationships with jiwoong weren't good to begin with in fact some of them seemed nicer to him. The truth is there's not much pity they'll get zb1 were already heavily tormented by trolls and hated on before the scandal so while we're in this era of troll kpop fans ehhh we're staying the same üò≠ they'll probably end up getting more pity after they disband which irks so bad..... but while I don't think anyone was trynna beef him the small relationship he had with hanbin kinda died so hmmmm maybe

      <p>maybe i just think too highly of people but... i can never cross out the fact that jiwoong may have not swore derogatively at the fan, and that it came out of a place of being tired or something unrelated. i know it was a bit quick but idk maybe we just will never know the full context which is kinda annoying. one of the worstly dealt scandals of all time, i‚Äôve seen worse things be covered up with an apology</p>

      <p>I've never really thought he was trying to say it at the fan and that he just said it whether it was from being fed or tired or whatever the reason it's just the fact that he said it AT her and she also felt like he was uninterested during their call.
