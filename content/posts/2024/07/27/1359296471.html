      <p>Mnet is SBS competition if we think about it so they probably made them do the whole cover so they can get the exclusive vs sbs only getting like 1:30 minutes</p>

      <p>Makes sense it was originally supposed to be a special stage for History M on mnet but got cancelled because bbangiz got covid, so the whole cover was probably always reserved for an mnet broadcast which is why sbs only got a short but despite them always doing full covers</p>

      <p>Trying to be on the more positive side I think the fact everyone actually got to sing a line by the first chorus gives me hope that the distribution won’t actually be bad for the whole thing.</p>

      <p>I think it’s possible they also re worked it like some members are probably more confident in vocals now than they were in August when this was recorded so probably got given more parts ect or just the fact that they sat on it for so long gave them chances to tweak it till it fit better</p>
