      <p>Mnet is SBS competition if we think about it so they probably made them do the whole cover so they can get the exclusive vs sbs only getting like 1:30 minutes</p>

      <p>Makes sense it was originally supposed to be a special stage for History M on mnet but got cancelled because bbangiz got covid, so the whole cover was probably always reserved for an mnet broadcast which is why sbs only got a short but despite them always doing full covers</p>
