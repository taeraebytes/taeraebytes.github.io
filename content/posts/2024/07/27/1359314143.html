      <p>In that sports show it was revealed that Hanbin weighs 67kg and when I went to dc, I see all of them being shocked, some wanting him to lose a little more weight, some expecting him to be very less, some saying that he should maintain it, some saying that he has a little bigger skeleton. Weight is that serious to them? I got scared reading those things.</p>

      <p>I only check the ones with no trolls. And they were never hateful, this was the only time I saw them discuss something this much but tbh, they were all like he weighs more than expected. They weren't like wanting or forcing him to lose weight. And one plus chat message from Hanbin will make them forget it too.</p>

      <p>ohhh ok ok hm I feel like maybe cuz he looks so skinny he probably seemed like he's lower than 67kg also that just means he has more muscle than fat
