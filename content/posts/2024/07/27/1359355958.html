      <p>Ok so the event itself postponed before there was any kind of notice that zb1 were attending then the page reached out to jeebmail and they announced it was happening THEN the event was back on time. My friends said they're starting soon so we'll see pics of them entering but that's it dfesta only allows other artists inside
