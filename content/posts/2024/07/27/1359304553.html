      <p>it really does look like a piercing and like maybe in some weird way it could be spit but it just looks so much like a piercing ball idk but wowwww I didn't know gunwook got freaky like that I'm still skeptical and don't believe it but it's funny to think ab it. Like it's tooo out of character
