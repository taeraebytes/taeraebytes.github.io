      <p>Anon I think you misunderstood the teaser they all have special stages and then a 3 mc one. Itâ€™s speculated that jaehyun and youngji have one together hanbin and miyeon and Sohee we havenâ€™t figured out. Because all three of them mentioned different concepts e.g hanbin said a prince (with miyeon) and Sohee mentioned acting and school concept. But even if it was just hanbin like itâ€™s mca thatâ€™s our music show ðŸ˜­</p>
