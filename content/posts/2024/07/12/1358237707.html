      <p>Ok Iâ€™ll never say allins donâ€™t buy views because we all know the big 2 sfs do but why are you lying. The day haoâ€™s dropped there was a 14k increase which was inline with all the other days before.

And thereâ€™s always a view spike when another member drops one because they get competitive the same way hao had a view spike the day gunwooks dropped.
