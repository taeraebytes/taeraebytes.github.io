      <p>You know its bad bad when Koreans are one of the most patriotic / 'pure blood' believers that Korean women would rather marry foreigners than Korean men. I saw an article on theqoo of a ss from a korean men forum known for misogyny that Korean women are going for Chinese men and it's pissing Korean men off so bad due to their history and clear sinophobia and it's kinda funny like yall did this to yourself ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and point proven by these nasty ass comments. 

I know misogyny is still prevalent in a lot of the world but at least they're making progress albeit slowly but Korea idk what it is but they refuse to move forward and change like they aint budging. I just saw on my tl a day ago some Korean politician was blaming Korean women for male suicides like wtf ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>it's surprising just how deeply rooted and common misogyny is in korea and not even to the pretty average level that most countries have it's very very extreme like almost on a terroristic level and crazier when u consider their development as a country like ğŸ˜ŸğŸ˜ŸğŸ˜Ÿ like wanting to force baby girls to be in school longer for some sex education because of what the men have done to this country it's disgusting ugh I'd go for any guy except a Korean too
