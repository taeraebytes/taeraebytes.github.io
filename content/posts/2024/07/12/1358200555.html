      <p>Riize are currently actively promotion while zb1 is not itâ€™s the same reason bnd arenâ€™t having a special stage because they are not actively promoting like itâ€™s hardly rocket science and idc if you donâ€™t wanna admit it but mca love zb1 and if there was the opportunity to give them a special stage they probably would but you forget they have a fansign in shanghai on the 16th and then tma on the 20th they probably do not have the time to squeeze in a non necessity perf rn especially while they are currently recording and practicing for the comeback</p>
