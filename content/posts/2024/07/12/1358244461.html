      <p>Its cause they asked for emoji suggestions and not a single person asked for the racoon  

And also probably bc theyâ€™re using two emojis for hanbin yet chose an unpopular emoji for hao. 

Its not that deep though</p>

      <p>Why are they so obsessed with hanbin bruh everyone uses two emojis for him I've seen a ton of different emojis for Hao it's not that deep, it's ironic cause during debut era I was thinking how parasociallly pathetic and jealous allins clearly were of Zhang Hao but now rosins are wayyyy more pathetic they're joining the ranks of armys blinks and orbits imo</p>
