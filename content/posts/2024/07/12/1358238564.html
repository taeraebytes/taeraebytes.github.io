      <p>I guess..? But that would mean he felt unsafe or something and he needed to speak up idk like this is kinda a freaky ass message to receive like just instant tweak

      <p>I can‚Äôt lie I seriously doubt it‚Äôs about that because if it was the case wouldn‚Äôt he just take the phone out of his hand and he deffo wouldn‚Äôt have been filming it either. Also I was there the day the video dropped and then got edited the chat seemed fine so I don‚Äôt think it was about that but if you went to his chat today after the tiktok dropped it got messyüò≠</p>

      <p>Diffrent anon but I doubt it is about the driving thing because when you deep the context and the fact hanbin already addressed it it makes no sense. Others are saying it‚Äôs because of where he was spotted the other day ‚òïÔ∏è place and fans were letting him know but there‚Äôs also screenshots of k fans scolding him for the tiktok with handong on his plus chat so it can be that too. Tbh there wasn‚Äôt really any bad stuff on plus chat when the video dropped even on twt I didn‚Äôt see anything bad so i seriously doubt it was related to the vlog and it has to be a more recent issue because the message was sent out of the blue and right after the tiktok was posted.</p>
