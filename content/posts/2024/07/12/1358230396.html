      <p>Riize are currently actively promotion while zb1 is not itâ€™s the same reason bnd arenâ€™t having a special stage because they are not actively promoting like itâ€™s hardly rocket science and idc if you donâ€™t wanna admit it but mca love zb1 and if there was the opportunity to give them a special stage they probably would but you forget they have a fansign in shanghai on the 16th and then tma on the 20th they probably do not have the time to squeeze in a non necessity perf rn especially while they are currently recording and practicing for the comeback</p>

      <p>It actually does make sense and hao was at mca yesterday so the rest of the boys could have been there too. I wonder what spoiler they fit into though because they have all been decoded. Youngji X Taeyang. Svt X Tws. Hanbin X Miyeon and MCs special stage. Unless the running thing has something to do with them but I doubt it.</p>

      <p>I think honestly they're not performing like if everything's been decoded and a group perf doesn't fit in then it's just not us

      <p>Possible but then is it only hao and hanbin in it. Hanbin obviously because heâ€™s mc but hao is the only other member who mentioned being there and they were the only two not at the Spotify listening thing. Is it like a collab music video with lots of other groups. Also 6 segments and mca awards â€¦ we better be getting one idc.</p>
