      <p>minghao fans are acting so stupid, there have always been idols with same, i literally see tempest hanbin, park hanbin, b.i hanbin sometimes the wind hanbin, fantasy boy hanbin when i search for hanbin( other hanbin's fans also never complained because the hanbin search is filled with zb1 hanbin), they should just shut up when they have to deal with just hao </p>
