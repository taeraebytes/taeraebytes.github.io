      <p>well fuck we need to disperse the talent across units theres not enough talent in the group for everyone to have a fully stacked unit please be amenable to compromise</p>

      <p>Well true the units would have to be balanced out with 3 most talented in different units and the bottom 3 talented in different units but like idk I feel like the kinds of performances matter as well

      <p>true like what kind of concept would taerae and gyuvin be able to do together without looking crazy... i think they'll prioritize members that suit each other over talent level because if anything they can just give them an easy song and lipsync</p>

      <p>Yea I think if the members match and can pull off a concept together talent doesn't matter as much idc as long as jiwoong stays out the gunwook unit
