      <p>annoying ass bitch she tried shoving her way into the bibigo connect stage and i saw this one girl stop it by telling her no and not let her cut but then she just went around and other people let her in like YOU GUYS NEED TO HAVE A BACKBONE thatâ€™s why this crazy ass bitch keeps getting a big head ðŸ˜‘ all she cares about is interactions and she genuinely thinks these idols are seeking her out and not bc sheâ€™s screaming at them and attending every fancall ðŸ˜­</p>
