      <p>You know what after today i realized i'm gonna need wakeone to start giving gunwook more chances to showcase his vocals, like why did i see many allins trying to shade him and saying hanbin is up there with taerae and hao like he's miles better than him? and their argument is "he's given this part" like that doesnt mean anything they can't even argue about technique because they're both at about the same level and gunwook is so much more versatile, he struggles with stability sometimes but other than that. yeah don't ever play his face about vocals</p>

      <p>hanbin fans die about discrediting gunwooks vocals it's crazy they want to prop him up on the haorae level so bad but it's just not gonna happen most people rank him very very close to gunwook rather than those two and they just don't like it. It's so irksome like just give gunwook 6 months of vocal lessons AND ITS UP HOE 😒

      <p>You all want to fight us so bad huh!!! All this vocal conversation wouldn't have started if that one idiot on twitter didn't say hanbin didn't deserve the only line he got. It wasn't like we started shit unprovoked. And no one even dragged gunwook or other members as far as remember. Stop trying to create a fanwar here.</p>

      <p>This hoe is so fast wow. "start a fanwar" when i'm rightfully mad about MY bias always getting discredited when it comes to vocal discourse, didn't say he was getting dragged bc i didn't see any (although i'm sure those akgaes were doing it), i said shading because some people were saying it should've gone to taerae hao or gunwook and allins started acting hanbin is some main vocalist and gunwook would never compare when everyone knows their only argument it bc he's given important parts, dpmo gunwook is the ONLY real all-rounder of the group and as much he's appreciated for his dancing his singing isn't appreciated enough for me. and idgaf about your beef with other members don't act like yall dont start shaking when someone says gunwook is the third best vocalist in the group (AND HE IS SINCE YOU PISSED ME OFF IDGAF).</p>
