      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>every allrounder thread ever lists her, kai, yeonjun, yeji, jennie, taeyong, etc. and it just invalidates the whole list for me ugh. at least seulgi is solidly 2/3 which is already kinda rare, but the others?? no words.</p>
