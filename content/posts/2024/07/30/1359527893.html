      <p>yeah some if not most arent even that weird, like these rich girlies obv start off as crazy gf stans but i think with time theyll realize yeah they got no chance ðŸ˜­ so then it becomes this weird long time acquaintance typa relation thing where u update them abour ur life, they talk about latest trends/ dance/ memes and ask if the idols if they can do it and even update them about their life like if they got into a good school or got a new job etc.

a lot of these rich girlies are just lonely and need friends or someone to talk to LMAOO lowkey miskeen ðŸ’”</p>
