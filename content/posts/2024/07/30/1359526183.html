    "question": "Hao won't ever get rid of his accent I think but he's the strongest by far, he was too much of a textbook speaker during bp but now speaks very comfortably, he has a wide vocabulary and can make complex sentences, impressive given that he had the least time to learn!\n\nRickys korean is less accented than Hao actually he's very slow though and has a smaller vocabulary, I think his Korean speaking skills are underrated tho considering he speaks three languages \n\nMatthew really speaks like the average Korean American lmao he still struggles w vocab but has the best accent",
    "reply": "yea Ricky just speaks a lot slower but it's impressive he speaks 3 languages but wow hao learned so fast im trynna get like him. But I wonder if matthews like list diaspora kids and his understandings better than his speech"

      <p>Hao won't ever get rid of his accent I think but he's the strongest by far, he was too much of a textbook speaker during bp but now speaks very comfortably, he has a wide vocabulary and can make complex sentences, impressive given that he had the least time to learn!

Rickys korean is less accented than Hao actually he's very slow though and has a smaller vocabulary, I think his Korean speaking skills are underrated tho considering he speaks three languages 

Matthew really speaks like the average Korean American lmao he still struggles w vocab but has the best accent</p>
