      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i am a stray kids hater but han is all rounder final boss. he dances good enough to fulfill the role, and is top 2 in both vocals and rapping in his group (and heâ€™s an actual rapper not an idol rapper). also heâ€™s a songwriter and producer for the group and his songs are actually good unlike bangchans the quality difference between the songs where heâ€™s the sole writer/composer vs where they work together is so stark itâ€™s sad that held back in the group bc heâ€™s too unpopular to make it as a soloist. he somehow managed to make felix and hyunjin sound palatable which is an incredible feat in its own.</p>
