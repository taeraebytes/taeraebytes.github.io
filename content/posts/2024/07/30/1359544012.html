      <p>where do u think all these rich girlies gets their money from??? ofc most of them are prob from a rich family already but i wanna tinchatting a bit cause i used to be deep in bts sasaeng/fansites lore back then and some them admited to do escorting/s3x work (i remember this specifically it was a japanese girl who had a jin fansite but also a stalkerüò≠ if anyone knows lmk) as a side hustle then i read smth on reddit where they knew someone lost control spending money on every flight and events then went on huge debt on their credit cardüò≠üò≠üò≠ do some anons want to share too??</p>

      <p>There's definitely a good chunk that are actually just filthy rich a chunk that are in debt (I mean it's easier zb1s temporary) a chunk that ration their money and periodically fly out they might be rich or have a rlly good job then there's a chunk that might be escorts but I doubt it in zb1s case. Like bts having big fansites that went into escorting makes sense I mean it's bts the demand is way crazier
