      <p>starting to believe idols actually hate the same ppl they get to talk to on fancalls cause that just gives stalker vibes but the money it brings them keeps it goingðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Yeah i think more often than not theyre thankful to them like recent examples yujin was waving to a fansite at the beach, taerae was asking azure why she didnt have her camera at kcon ending stage,  ofc some r annoying but they dont hate them honestly fansites do so much for groups in terms of promotion and the way kpop works, companies r encouraging stalkers</p>
