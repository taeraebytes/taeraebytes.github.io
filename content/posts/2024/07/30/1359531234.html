    "reply": "There's definitely a good chunk that are actually just filthy rich a chunk that are in debt (I mean it's easier zb1s temporary) a chunk that ration their money and periodically fly out they might be rich or have a rlly good job then there's a chunk that might be escorts but I doubt it in zb1s case. Like bts having big fansites that went into escorting makes sense I mean it's bts the demand is way crazier"
