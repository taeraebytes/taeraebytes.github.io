      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Not anon ðŸ˜­ yeah her position is leader, main dancer and lead rapper right? But imo her dancing is shit for a main dancer, she is a better singer than a rapper she is no all rounder pls good performer tho</p>
