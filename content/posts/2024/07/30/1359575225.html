      <p>Wakeone keeps pissing kzeroses off like the isac lineup is so nugu no one will be tuning in except for the fanbases that attend seriously its just bad useless promo. They need rest! They will have their cb as well. What if they get injured? Dumb decisions  again and again</p>

      <p>It's more so other things that the fans are are present with the idols the whole time that's hard to achieve the gruesome filming + injury prone activities it's gonna be bad for both the group and the fans not to mention THERES NOTHING GOOD AB THIS LINEUP
