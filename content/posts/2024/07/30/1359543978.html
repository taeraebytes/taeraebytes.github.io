      <p>Seeing how quickly 143 revealed MAIDEN (idk if itâ€™s spelt right) lineup and recorded their debut (September debut) they were obviously prepped and planned ages in advance and I wonder if any of the other boys companies are doing so, and who will be the first to redebut once they separate</p>

      <p>Oh yea definitely there wasn't room for any extension for those two but I doubt it was prepped in an advance any more than 6ish months so as of now none of their companies could have plans but I think both thel1ve and yuehua seem obvious

      <p>Yuehua is just so gutterbut when it comes to korea management so I wouldn't really think they would have anything ready aside from making hao do some shit in China maybe i remember how popular hyeongseop and euiwoong were during pd101 and it took them 5 years to debut them i mean obviously it's very diff this time around but I wouldn't put any expectations on them</p>
