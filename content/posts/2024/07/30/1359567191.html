 they are coming after zb1â€™s title tracks. Comparing them to previous produce groups ðŸ˜” i feel like zb1 really wonâ€™t be appreciated until after their disbandment. Love how kep1er isnâ€™t mentioned at all though.</p>

      <p>Lmaoooooo my mutuals who were previous produce stans were livid because besides energetic wannaones other titles were hated ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like people are genuinely just so harsh on zb1 for no reason and it is true that once they disband they'll get their flowers it's so obvious and irksome like I'm sorry boomerang is shit compared to zb1s titles
