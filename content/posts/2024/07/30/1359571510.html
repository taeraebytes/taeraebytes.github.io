      <p>not really he did good but he doesnt have the cleanest falsetto in the group have you listened to hao's intro? his falsetto is incredible and taerae would've ate it up as well them using chest voice more often than head voice indicates their wider range, doesnt mean they can't pull off head voice</p>

      <p>I say it all the time I don't know too much about vocals so I can't say but he sounded fine but if the beginning was a falsettos haos was nice too and I'm sure taerae could've pulled it off too

      <p>Yes obviously taerae wouldve done it well (and better actually) anon but hanbin is always gonna get a part that is important we just need to accept it it's not like he butchers it so we're chill with it</p>
