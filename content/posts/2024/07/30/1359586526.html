 they are coming after zb1â€™s title tracks. Comparing them to previous produce groups ðŸ˜” i feel like zb1 really wonâ€™t be appreciated until after their disbandment. Love how kep1er isnâ€™t mentioned at all though.</p>

      <p>Lmaoooooo my mutuals who were previous produce stans were livid because besides energetic wannaones other titles were hated ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like people are genuinely just so harsh on zb1 for no reason and it is true that once they disband they'll get their flowers it's so obvious and irksome like I'm sorry boomerang is shit compared to zb1s titles

      <p>Oh please, don't ever compare zb1 with wanna one. as much as i love zb1, their discography was far better than zb1. wanna one were super big in korea at that time, after energetic they have beautiful which super popular also and gain many awards. whole wanna one song played on every corner of state. korean gp love wanna one, but not zb1.</p>
