      <p>Wakeone keeps pissing kzeroses off like the isac lineup is so nugu no one will be tuning in except for the fanbases that attend seriously its just bad useless promo. They need rest! They will have their cb as well. What if they get injured? Dumb decisions  again and again</p>

      <p>It's more so other things that the fans are are present with the idols the whole time that's hard to achieve the gruesome filming + injury prone activities it's gonna be bad for both the group and the fans not to mention THERES NOTHING GOOD AB THIS LINEUP

      <p>No not really esp in our case.

Comeback coming up and a tour that span 3 months. Any risk of injury is not worth it at all but Wakeone is really risking it all for what 5 mins of screentime? 

Isac filming is ridiculously long and exhausting and again for what 5 mins of screen time? They could've spent that day more productive doing better things that will actually benefit them whether it's practicing for comeback/ world tour, filming ot9 content or even taking a day off to rest and hang out. Isac was so last minute I don't think they even prepared for it and probably preparing now when they're already busy af, they just got back from the states and ran straight to the practice room till 12am... I mean isnt it worst to attend and participate and lose to nugu groups because they're tired and didn't have time to properly prepare ðŸ˜­</p>
