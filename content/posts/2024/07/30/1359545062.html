    "question": "Do u think its a good idea that our streaming team is colleectng funds for korean charts mainly over intl charts like itunes, i personally think its a dumb idea as we had record numbers for last cb and we need to strengthen and beat those. from what ik from previous fandoms bugs passes arent cheap and you need a lot of power to keep a song at #1 for a long time",
    "reply": "Bugs was a lot more important for counting towards wins I don't think the itune records actually hold a value like that? while the records good to beat and definitely used to have a big prestige about them but bugs is suuuuper important it was one of our more stable chartings even tho it was hard. surprisingly even tho a lot of the bugs funding was onsite and last minute the streaming base did pretty good now that there's time I think we'll be aight. And cmiiw you can't rlly raise funds for that you have to count on people in other countries to buy the album on iTunes right?"
