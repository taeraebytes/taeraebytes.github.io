    "question": "they prob land around 5-6pm korean time today. theres always two airlines korea air and asiana that depart together literally 20-30 mins apart and twice a day from lax to icn so its really predictable when they'll arrive because those two airlines are the only direct flight from lax and icn and vice versa and they only depart twice in a day, either noon or midnight and we know they got on the noon flight and it doesnt matter which airline they take because they literally depart 20-30 mins apart",
    "reply": "yea I was looking and it's just those two and I doubt they'd take Asiana it's known to be the budget Korea air so def around then"
