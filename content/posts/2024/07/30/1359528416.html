      <p>Seeing how quickly 143 revealed MAIDEN (idk if it’s spelt right) lineup and recorded their debut (September debut) they were obviously prepped and planned ages in advance and I wonder if any of the other boys companies are doing so, and who will be the first to redebut once they separate</p>

      <p>Oh yea definitely there wasn't room for any extension for those two but I doubt it was prepped in an advance any more than 6ish months so as of now none of their companies could have plans but I think both thel1ve and yuehua seem obvious

      <p>Yuehua I don’t think will add any members if they are keeping yuehuaz as a 6 because the new members will get overshadowed so all they have to do is work on concepts and songs. Hanbin’s company would need to recruit and train trainees if they want him in a group and they were running their auditions for males 2002-2012? all last year and still running I think so it’s obvious they are prepping a group for him to go into aswell, should zb1 not extend.</p>

      <p>I've always had a feeling they would add someone just cuz I think they're gonna drop yunseo but hey and hanbins company I think won't put him in a group it's just a feeling and I can see what kind of career he'd have on his own and it's rlly suited to his company
