      <p>lmao on that note i always see ppl call seulgi and all rounder and i've always been so confused by that bc i don't think she's ever rapped??????? like she's a good dancer and vocalist and i know kpop rap is usually pretty shit but she still doesn't fulfil that all rounder title ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>One thing about sm idols is arrogance in abundance without the skills to back it up ðŸ’€ the actual singers in sm never boast , even in nct taeil, doyoung , jaehyun keep quiet. Itâ€™s the dream ones that mouth off about how amazing their singing is ðŸ˜‚ and usually are the ones with voice cracks and going off key everytime</p>
