      <p>Seeing how quickly 143 revealed MAIDEN (idk if itâ€™s spelt right) lineup and recorded their debut (September debut) they were obviously prepped and planned ages in advance and I wonder if any of the other boys companies are doing so, and who will be the first to redebut once they separate</p>

      <p>Oh yea definitely there wasn't room for any extension for those two but I doubt it was prepped in an advance any more than 6ish months so as of now none of their companies could have plans but I think both thel1ve and yuehua seem obvious

      <p>Yuehua is just so gutterbut when it comes to korea management so I wouldn't really think they would have anything ready aside from making hao do some shit in China maybe i remember how popular hyeongseop and euiwoong were during pd101 and it took them 5 years to debut them i mean obviously it's very diff this time around but I wouldn't put any expectations on them</p>

      <p>im not a yuehuaz fan but the comparisons y'all make with tempest and zb1 is just.... they didnt debut and werent even that big like plssss the better comparison is cravity and starship. starship debuted the x1 and x1-tobe members pretty quickly after disbandment and gives them quite good promotion, they arent that big but i think it will be similar level of popularity for yuheuaz where the core fans stay and they just dont gain any new fans</p>

      <p>I think of future yuehua as a mix just cuz starship is much better at managing their artists while yuehua has a reputation of sabotage

      <p>Why exactly would I compare to cravity and starship hoe ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the discussion was about management not about how popular the trainees were but ya i guess since theyre doing evenne quite nicely I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe yuehua will do something useful for once</p>

      <p>I mean that group idea WAS made by Wakeone, I can only imagine their contract has very specific measures to keep them from being popular or in relation to zb1</p>

      <p>yup it's speculated they're not rlly allowed to be around each other so that's why evnne are usually at the budget events of what zb1 do but they're both gonna be at isac which just builds on the fact that wakeone probably accepted some last minute deal (only group without a banner)
