      <p>I need ppl to understand that the reason why most intl fans don't care for yujin ins't because he's a minor but bc he's boring! sure, kfans and cfans love him but that's cuz they prioritize visuals, and as we have seen from the mic discourse they don't care for his personality. he isn't a particularly good singer or dancer or an entertainer. his maknae status is the only thing he has going on for him but he doesn't really harp in on it like other idols do (ex: eunchae) so there's nothing for people to attach themselves to. that's why when intl fans praise him they usually mention his age or relations to other members. he is BORING. and the reason why he is the most "neutral" member that people don't hate nor love, is because he is.... just there.</p>

      <p>Well no that's a lie it's very obvious and he's still well liked you can just say you don't pay attention to him instead of lying

      <p>it's not that he's boring but he doesnt project the most interesting parts of his personality very well, which is the traditional role of the entertainer. the fact that you have to pay special attention to him to see his personality is the point anons are getting at (i think) bc most people who arent hooked immediately by someone's charisma, looks, or whatever else arent gonna do that for them, nor should they be expected to tbh. i think that kind of logic puts the responsibility on the fan to find the idol entertaining, rather than on the idol to entertain fans. 

the thing is with yujin and other idols like him, i think people who like them consider their reserved nature a 'cute' or 'relatable' point of appeal, so there's no real incentive to develop entertainment skills beyond just following their own whims in order to gain a broader audience since looks and marketing already bring in fans that like (and fetishize) the quiet reluctant introvert visual maknae role, which has always been at the epicenter of kpop. and despite what i said before, some entertainment personas specifically rely on subtlety and reluctance to intrigue fans and allow them to fill in the blanks. fans already are inclined to frame a shy introvert pretty person as misunderstood, so why not let them keep doing the heavy lifting?</p>

      <p>I can understand that but it's just not true when u say Americans dislike yujin cuz he's boring Americans don't dislike him and the simple reason he's biased less is cuz of his age that's really all it is. I think because he's quiet and introverted it's probably harder for someone to get into him for personality but he's popular regardless and I think he's been working on himself he's definitely much more open than he used to be and I find him interesting enough
