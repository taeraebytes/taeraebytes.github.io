 . Itâ€™s not totally unexpected but it just seems like a friendly sunbae hoobae relationship, Iâ€™d say heâ€™s probably more closer to yeonjun which was more unexpected because he mentioned they were going  to go out to dinner and dance together and they always hug when they see eachother and yj mentioned him as one of his friends in a fansign to me that friendship was a little more unexpected</p>

      <p>I think they're just really friendly, especially hao and hanbin from what I've seen....they look like the type to have everyone's contacts just because, very sociable. I dont think any of them are actually friends tho</p>

      <p>We need the friendliness directed to innocents not criminals but it's all just pretty surface level I'm assuming
