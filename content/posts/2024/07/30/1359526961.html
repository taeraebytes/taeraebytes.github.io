      <p>Hao won't ever get rid of his accent I think but he's the strongest by far, he was too much of a textbook speaker during bp but now speaks very comfortably, he has a wide vocabulary and can make complex sentences, impressive given that he had the least time to learn!

Rickys korean is less accented than Hao actually he's very slow though and has a smaller vocabulary, I think his Korean speaking skills are underrated tho considering he speaks three languages 

Matthew really speaks like the average Korean American lmao he still struggles w vocab but has the best accent</p>

      <p>I think as a diaspora I get Matthew cause it's hard to learn a language you instinctively knew your whole life like you don't feel the need to it's unnatural yk so you tend to be stuck at a certain level
Ricky's Chinese accent isn't as obvious as Hao both in Korean and English I think it's because he already had to adapt to different cultures as he grew up I mean he switched countries three times before 18, he's decently fluent in all three which is impressive 
Compared to most cn idols Hao is really really passionate about learning the language you can tell lmao you can also tell he's much more of the studious textbook type than the other two, he improved veryyy fast tho having to actively communicate in Korean w his friends rather than just learning by himself did him a lot of good (as I doubt he was really talking to the Korean yh trainees pre debut)</p>

      <p>Omgggg I feel u trynna become fluent in ur mother tongue is so weird cuz like you have the tools but since he's being forced to speak korean he'll just get better naturally rather
