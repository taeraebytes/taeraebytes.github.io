 they are coming after zb1â€™s title tracks. Comparing them to previous produce groups ðŸ˜” i feel like zb1 really wonâ€™t be appreciated until after their disbandment. Love how kep1er isnâ€™t mentioned at all though.</p>

      <p>Lmaoooooo my mutuals who were previous produce stans were livid because besides energetic wannaones other titles were hated ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like people are genuinely just so harsh on zb1 for no reason and it is true that once they disband they'll get their flowers it's so obvious and irksome like I'm sorry boomerang is shit compared to zb1s titles

      <p>ioiâ€™s only hit that resonated with the public was very very very but the rest of their songs are largely ignored.  Wanna oneâ€™s only hit was energetic other title tracks are terrible. Iz*one had to take lver from clc and that wasnâ€™t as big as a hit as the previous two songs mentioned, they were at least more consistent with their musical identity but at the time around their disbandment i saw people were saying how repetitive their title tracks sounded and non of their following title tracks could match the success of their debut. X1â€™s flash is absolute dookie. Itâ€™s just nostalgia getting to them as usual.</p>
