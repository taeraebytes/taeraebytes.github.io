      <p>Iâ€™m a zerosetiny and idk what happened and how but Hanbinâ€™s aotm went viral among atinys lol a lot of my moots are asking about him and zb1 now, some are checking out zb1â€™s discography idk how many will tune into the cb though since itâ€™s still a month apart but I had to say thank you hanbin ðŸ˜­ i was kinda pissed about him covering an original song but at the end of the day his tutting is just extraordinary and made me realise us as fans are used to seeing him and expect this of him but non fans are really gagged with his performance specially seeing atinys calling this the best aotm performance when wonyoung was also a part of aotm lol. He really needs to tap into more of this because his dance always makes people intrigued about him.</p>

      <p>ugh itâ€™s always like this like the members literally go viral almost everyday and people always say they are checking them out but then there really isnâ€™t something about the group to get hooked in like a regular variety show ðŸ˜­ i knew so many casuals who got into them through the run run cover but didnâ€™t really tap in completely bc they have nothing to watch about the group</p>

      <p>there really isn't anything like if you're not locked onto a bias it's so hard to be casual or even begin trying to like the group there's barely any content they get shipped off to a million festivals and will go inactive like wow this is just gutter

      <p>like theres a reason why groups like svt and bts are thriving even through inactivity because fans have something to watch during hiatuses but with zb1 the only thing you are gonna watch is akgaes fighting</p>

      <p>even wanna one had such great contents so you can just easily ignore the akgaes bc the shows were so much fun i literally stanned them after boomerang and i was immediately attached after watching zero base</p>
