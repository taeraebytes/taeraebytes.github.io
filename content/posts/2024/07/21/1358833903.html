      <p>another anon and I'm always curious what you mean by haircut? like his style now but just shorter or do u have a specific haircut u like on him? hes not my bias but I think today is my ideal hair on him he looks best when his forehead is exposed or half exposed like today and I cant imagine him with teh typical korean mushroom cut üò≠</p>
