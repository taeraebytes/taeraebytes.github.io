      <p>ur actually hilarious if u think I'm living in a universe where those two get an aotm next...... but by aotm standard it ends with hanbin

      <p>Hanbin is mid performer in group actually and he is the first member on AOTM cause he is CJ/wakeone favorite ..also there may be possible cause even itzy 3 members r on it and watch one of these two will be on it too sooner or later.</p>

      <p>hanbin is the main dancer of the group whether u like it or not and itzy is known for their very strong dance line so even with that in mind it still would not go to hao or yujin next üò≠

      <p>Anon I don‚Äôt not care for hanbin like that but him getting aotm from zb1 literally made the most sense like queer said whether you like it or not he is recognised as the main dancer and is quite literally known for his dance üò≠ and your just looking goofy at this point trying to argue that either yujin or hao would have been more deserving. If three members of itzy can go we still have Gunwook and Matthew before luckyz would be considered.</p>

      <p>Like wow you guys can hate hanbin idrc but like we gotta start being realistic with the hate if u seriously think the first aotm was going to anyone else ur lying to urself üò≠..... I was salty af about it but it made sense and exactly if there were to be three aotms its still not gonna be hao and yujin they're not the strongest dancers in the group aotm doesn't stray away from that aspect so let's shoot for that mix and max üòÇüôè
