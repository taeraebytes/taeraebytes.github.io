      <p>i think they're mad because hao wasn't given special stages in korean events and award shows held in Korea. he'll only get special stage outside korea.also, because it's Hao & Taerae's birthday month and would have been nice if they were given special stage together since gunwook and taerae already did unit in a singing show.</p>

      <p>the thing is, everyone is building their career in SK and they need to be perceived by the Korean public. If you don't have presence in SK, it's gonna be hard to sustain a career in there. events like this which is broadcasted in national tv (sbs, kbs,mbc)with korean live audience is always a nice venue to show your talent.but he wasnt given the chance yet.it's always outside sk,in front of foreign fans.</p>

      <p>I know the benefits of having more stages in korea rather than overseas but to me a chance is a chance which a lot of the members don't get and I just think hao will get one eventually anyways
