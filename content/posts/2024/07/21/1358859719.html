      <p>There is this one podcast ep I found on zb1 on YouTube and the person said how there's been almost no negativity after the finale in terms of like line up and sfs and everyone was correcting them in the comments saying that's NOT true and the person said they're not on twt so they'd never heard about any of it on YouTube and Instagram and that whatever problem they had could never be as bad as other groups like kep1er (they have a 8 hour long ep on kep1ers solo fan problem ðŸ˜­) but anyways this really put things into perspective because like everything these ppl r always tweaking about on twt just has almost no consequences outside of twts echo chamber</p>
