      <p>I do wish someone else had done it but in comparison to their most recent TikTokâ€™s posted it actually does have the highest views and engagements. Most the other groups who are posting it regularly clear 1 million likes where thatâ€™s not exactly the norm for us.</p>

      <p>I mean it's not a norm but they're pretty close to it usually we just have no kind of social media team while other groups do
