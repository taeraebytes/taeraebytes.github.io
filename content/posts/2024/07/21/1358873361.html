      <p>I’m a zerosetiny and idk what happened and how but Hanbin’s aotm went viral among atinys lol a lot of my moots are asking about him and zb1 now, some are checking out zb1’s discography idk how many will tune into the cb though since it’s still a month apart but I had to say thank you hanbin 😭 i was kinda pissed about him covering an original song but at the end of the day his tutting is just extraordinary and made me realise us as fans are used to seeing him and expect this of him but non fans are really gagged with his performance specially seeing atinys calling this the best aotm performance when wonyoung was also a part of aotm lol. He really needs to tap into more of this because his dance always makes people intrigued about him.</p>

      <p>also, do you REALLY wanna associate with atinys of all people. like omg stays just as insufferable but at least they buy and stream, what do you gain from associating with ateez fans other than bad odor</p>
