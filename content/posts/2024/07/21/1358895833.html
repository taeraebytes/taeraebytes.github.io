      <p>first place doesnt even have matter in iland cause they never said itâ€™ll be the center unlike produce/planet series enha doesnt have a permanent center even if jungwon won bc it just doesnt work it on permanent groups ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>heeseung is literally enhypen center ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ u can check on kpop profile also before debuting enhypen voted for leader because the company said heeseung can't handle two things together so that's how by voting jungwon got chosed and they said heeseung is their center</p>

      <p>Tbh I think it does I feel like itâ€™s pretty obvious heeseung is their center but itâ€™s not as obvious as it is with survival groups like heâ€™s not in centers a lot for standing or photoshoots they mix it up alot but as the strongest vocalist and a strong dancer too heâ€™s usually the main highlight of their performances even if he doesnâ€™t have the most lines</p>

      <p>I would've guessed him ngl even tho I don't know much ab the group but that's what being center is more about not rlly being in the middle the whole time but I can see it even tho he's more of a soft center
