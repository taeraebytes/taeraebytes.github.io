      <p>idk if ure gonna reply to this but i just want to say that wow as a rosin myself, the constant outrage of the fandom actually tires me out so much like pleaseeeee not everyone is an enemy can we guys just stick on focusing and supporting hao instead of screaming st everyone every single time...... and no, this doesnt mean that i condone any hate against him i just want to say that like yeah i get the constant outrage at wakeone they actually deserve that but cmon not everything's an attack or a dig at hao pls be rational for a second 😭😭😭😭</p>

      <p>I have time today but yea this is pretty much why jang left cc constant anger just doesn't serve any kind of purpose and can really ruin a lot of ur experience it's possible to be a rosin and not mad all the time just take breaks when u need to and don't force urself to see things u don't wanna see

      <p>yes this i get being mad at wakeone but constantly nitpicking everything does nothing. crosins have actually discussed this after hao’s weibo live the general concensus was “don’t waste time cursing them and getting distracted, focus on hao only and spread positive energy” i think hao asking for positive energy last time got to them and i hope the iside follows through too.. and anon just choose your mutuals wisely cause my tl was fine</p>
