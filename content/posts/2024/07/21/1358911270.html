      <p>gunwooks an oldhead ðŸ˜­ðŸ’” the million dollar baby tiktok did so well tho even though it's an old sound he has the platform he just needs the plan. I have a new idea for him now tho and its even more unrealistic than mamushi he needs to do a tiktok cover of latrices new viral choreo i already send him hella messages on plus chat LIKE PLEEEEEK
