      <p>Yeah I wouldnâ€™t care too much by what they say because Iâ€™ve seen so many delete their tweets even after getting clocked by non fans ðŸ˜­ like Iâ€™m sorry but doing tutting once for naughty doesnâ€™t make them professionals</p>

      <p>Mind you this same fandom was making freak tweets about yujin because of his tiktok with yujin and will probably have shit to say about the cover stage next week. Overall no oneâ€™s taking them seriously nor actually gaf so who really cares what they cry about</p>

      <p>Like the only thing I've seen were allins saying that they wanted a challenge with red velvet but they didn't say anything bad bc they know that the day reve came to mcountdown hanbin was also filming for iland and he was going forth and back between mcountdown and Iland sets.</p>

      <p>They say alot in priv ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ allins used to like gyuvin and yujin with hanbin but they dropped yujin since he became MC and started to get more jobs and now they are only holding on gyuvin i think they only like members when they aren't threat to hanbin * duck smoking gif* because they were used to be biggest woongsungz shipper but dropped him after he became Gucci endorser with hanbin</p>
