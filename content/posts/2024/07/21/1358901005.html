      <p>that's just what a big pushed ship looks like but not only do they get invasive shipping their fans are rivals whilst they're close friends so tiredness is possible

      <p>haobin are literally a tool to the company so yea it's pushed they don't tap into content and there are plenty of good reasons as to why but they use them and use them specifically

      <p>Haobin are not a pushed pair at all, they should be but they're not because Wakeone carter to solos and algaes the only time I can remember them actively using them as a tool was post jiwoong scandal, winrina, jumil, nomin, markhyuck, minwon, those are actual pushed pairs it's like night and day</p>

      <p>In terms of zb1 I wouldn't compare anything they do to other groups cuz when has it ever been normal but them specifically using them at specific times thats why

      <p>Hmm that doesn’t seem like a comeback think though, it could be but after the whole pushing for the 4 cuts and more specifically after he got asked to his face if he kisses hao he cut down a lot of much he talked about him. Might seem like a big reduction but in comparison to other members he talks about the members a regular amount it’s just before he talked about him sooo much to the point his akgaes were tweaking on shippers. Opposite hao mentions hanbin alot more now when before he went months on bubble without mentioning him once, but he seems more laid back and idgaf attitude now.</p>
