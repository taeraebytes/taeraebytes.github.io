      <p>Ok ngl but when I saw that special stage of Myungjae, Sohee and Hanbin I got kinda jealous bc the stage composition and the choreography were too good. There's a lot of things that irk me about seventeen and their fans too but they really have amazing stage directors and choreographers. The stage was so good, I got so jealous while watching it bc that's something I've been wanting from zb1 since a long time ago. 

And zb1 problem is not only their choreographer's but also the fact that they don't see to have an stage director that elevates their performances either.</p>

      <p>That video was so fun. Although I cringed a bit when Hanbin was like omg one of my biggest dreams was to come to hybe dance rooms, but then it was sooo lit they started singing some songs like spot by zico and jennie, some gdragon song and they also sang a danced to boom boom bass (idk the name tbh but it's that new riize song)</p>

      <p>Jaehyun irks me but he was a good host for them. Also during award shows during BND performances they had some big doors and like each member had one and Jaehyun bring his door to the dance studio so they could also record tiktoks with it. They did 2 tiktoks and I was like woah, meanwhile wakeone can't even do that shit but they can let keeho use matthew dancing to nasty for his tiktok just for some clout</p>

      <p>we can say whatever shit to jaehyun but that guy is bringing his clout to his group.after his mc job, they become relevant, sold mire albums and all over tweet, especially in japan when they were so nugu last year.jaehyun's weirdness is interesting to some people that they follow him to his group.</p>

      <p>Anon bnd have been steadily increasing their fanbase since last year and the don’t have half the problems that are causing the limitations to our fandom growth. They also had woonhak on inkigayo before jaehyun on mca and while it probably did bring some new fans neither have went seriously viral for being an mc there growth hasn’t exploded it’s had a steady increase.</p>
