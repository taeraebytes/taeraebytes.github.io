      <p>haobin are literally a tool to the company so yea it's pushed they don't tap into content and there are plenty of good reasons as to why but they use them and use them specifically

      <p>Haobin are not a pushed pair at all, they should be but they're not because Wakeone carter to solos and algaes the only time I can remember them actively using them as a tool was post jiwoong scandal, winrina, jumil, nomin, markhyuck, minwon, those are actual pushed pairs it's like night and day</p>

      <p>In terms of zb1 I wouldn't compare anything they do to other groups cuz when has it ever been normal but them specifically using them at specific times thats why
