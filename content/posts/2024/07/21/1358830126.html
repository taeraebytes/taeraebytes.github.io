      <p>can chinese fans not act like any member other than hao yujin Ricky is a stain under their shoe? we get it your faves are them three cheer a bit for the others too, this is why whenever they go to japan and western countries (probably sea countries too we will see) it is so much better because even the least popular member gets cheers</p>

      <p>anon just made shit up there were more cheers for hao ricky and yujin simply bc there were collectively more fans of them there ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s not like they were silent on purpose for the other members. hanbin and gunwook had a lot of cheers too actually ppl wouldnâ€™t stop screaming gunwooks name in all my clips. the sudden cfan akgae allegations are crazy to me everyone was a fan of everyone in the venue.</p>
