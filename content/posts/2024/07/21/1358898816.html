      <p>half the group is confirmed to have renewed already even tho Kevin has had the most issues with ist I think he'll still renew they're just pushing for better terms I don't see any of them leaving the group but maybe it's possible they leave the company since they're all starting to venture into their own stuff but I have a feeling they'll most likely just renew and continue as 11
