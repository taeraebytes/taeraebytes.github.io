      <p>I've seen Haos profile and it doesn't look like he did anything to his nose recently but his vibe has been very different</p>

      <p>his nose hasn't changed recently it's not that but styling can also really change a lot I think for the most part it's his dark hair. Lowkey tho his lower face was looking bloaty for the past few months probably cuz he got something to blend the implant but it's settled down and he just looks healthier overall
