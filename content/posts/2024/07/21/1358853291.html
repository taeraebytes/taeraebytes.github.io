      <p>Ok ngl but when I saw that special stage of Myungjae, Sohee and Hanbin I got kinda jealous bc the stage composition and the choreography were too good. There's a lot of things that irk me about seventeen and their fans too but they really have amazing stage directors and choreographers. The stage was so good, I got so jealous while watching it bc that's something I've been wanting from zb1 since a long time ago. 

And zb1 problem is not only their choreographer's but also the fact that they don't see to have an stage director that elevates their performances either.</p>

      <p>That video was so fun. Although I cringed a bit when Hanbin was like omg one of my biggest dreams was to come to hybe dance rooms, but then it was sooo lit they started singing some songs like spot by zico and jennie, some gdragon song and they also sang a danced to boom boom bass (idk the name tbh but it's that new riize song)</p>
