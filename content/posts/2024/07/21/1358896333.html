      <p>i think they're mad because hao wasn't given special stages in korean events and award shows held in Korea. he'll only get special stage outside korea.also, because it's Hao & Taerae's birthday month and would have been nice if they were given special stage together since gunwook and taerae already did unit in a singing show.</p>
