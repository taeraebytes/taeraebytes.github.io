      <p>that's just what a big pushed ship looks like but not only do they get invasive shipping their fans are rivals whilst they're close friends so tiredness is possible

      <p>haobin are literally a tool to the company so yea it's pushed they don't tap into content and there are plenty of good reasons as to why but they use them and use them specifically

      <p>Haobin are not a pushed pair at all, they should be but they're not because Wakeone carter to solos and algaes the only time I can remember them actively using them as a tool was post jiwoong scandal, winrina, jumil, nomin, markhyuck, minwon, those are actual pushed pairs it's like night and day</p>

      <p>Hmm that doesnâ€™t seem like a comeback think though, it could be but after the whole pushing for the 4 cuts and more specifically after he got asked to his face if he kisses hao he cut down a lot of much he talked about him. Might seem like a big reduction but in comparison to other members he talks about the members a regular amount itâ€™s just before he talked about him sooo much to the point his akgaes were tweaking on shippers. Opposite hao mentions hanbin alot more now when before he went months on bubble without mentioning him once, but he seems more laid back and idgaf attitude now.</p>

      <p>i was just explaining it to lotus... ngl u gotta be a certain level of mental to even tap in like idk how else to explain it other than if you're into similar things like anime vtubers gacha idols enstars it'll make sense to you like idkkkkk it's kind of an almost more parasocially kinda thing than just regular kpop since they're not real but it's also an escape from real men and there's a certain level of "perfect" they can be since again not real

      <p>yup their fans are like 90% disconnected from kpop especially the korean ones they will reject kpop cause most of them are in the older age range. and they are more reachable than a top class idol without spending that much money they just join their lives. its kinda like how korea has made qwer, a girlband made of gamers very popular. the songs are good and they give men that kinda escape which is closer to their interest of gaming so they too are very disconnected from the kpop industry. qwer have more public recognition whilst plave have a core fanbase, but they both can be said to be the top 5th gen groups domestically for bg and gg</p>
