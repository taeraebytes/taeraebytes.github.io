      <p>Ok ngl but when I saw that special stage of Myungjae, Sohee and Hanbin I got kinda jealous bc the stage composition and the choreography were too good. There's a lot of things that irk me about seventeen and their fans too but they really have amazing stage directors and choreographers. The stage was so good, I got so jealous while watching it bc that's something I've been wanting from zb1 since a long time ago. 

And zb1 problem is not only their choreographer's but also the fact that they don't see to have an stage director that elevates their performances either.</p>

      <p>like people seem to miss the fact that an stage director can do sooo much for a group. for example with kiof, you can see that their title tracks have some directing going on, same with seventeen on every title track. with zb1 it looks like they just get some mid choreography as if it's was a bside they are performing for a day</p>

      <p>It all comes down to having a creative vision: you can do much more with a less tight budget but you have to be inspired and hire creatives to begin with, kiof is a good example but also look at chui and Yves from loona</p>
