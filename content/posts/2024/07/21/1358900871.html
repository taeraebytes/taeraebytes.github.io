      <p>I'm not blind.. and them being genuine wouldn't even change anything because it's about closeness and both of them have other members they're closer to their friendships pretty limited anyways

      <p>It's speculation like that's most of what we do ofc we don't know what happened but interactions were up right after so it doesn't take much to connect I didn't mention the bit but it still doesn't change what I think them being genuine doesn't necessarily trump anything
