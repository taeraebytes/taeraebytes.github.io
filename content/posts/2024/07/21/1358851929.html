      <p>Ok ngl but when I saw that special stage of Myungjae, Sohee and Hanbin I got kinda jealous bc the stage composition and the choreography were too good. There's a lot of things that irk me about seventeen and their fans too but they really have amazing stage directors and choreographers. The stage was so good, I got so jealous while watching it bc that's something I've been wanting from zb1 since a long time ago. 

And zb1 problem is not only their choreographer's but also the fact that they don't see to have an stage director that elevates their performances either.</p>
