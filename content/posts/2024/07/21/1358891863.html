      <p>Yeah I wouldnâ€™t care too much by what they say because Iâ€™ve seen so many delete their tweets even after getting clocked by non fans ðŸ˜­ like Iâ€™m sorry but doing tutting once for naughty doesnâ€™t make them professionals</p>

      <p>Mind you this same fandom was making freak tweets about yujin because of his tiktok with yujin and will probably have shit to say about the cover stage next week. Overall no oneâ€™s taking them seriously nor actually gaf so who really cares what they cry about</p>
