      <p>why is this person surprised over it being yellow/orange by taerae standards this is a very normal design üò≠ do non-taerae fans even know about the carrot microphone 
his original mic design idea was literally for the mic to look exactly like a CARROT He asked for a carrot microphone with a lime green head and an orange handle with ‚Äúcarrot wrinkles‚Äù on it and ppl seriously had to sit down and make over 20 different carrot microphone designs and fill out a google form to vote for the best carrot microphone</p>
