      <p>Oh but we knew that they've been dating since years ago, it's just that they kept denying it to save face bc she was a trainee and he was a mentor during Chuang</p>

      <p>Like their age gap isn't bad he's just 4 years older than her but the context of him being his mentor on Chuang and her being a trainee, then her getting signed on his agency and him being his boss... Like of course that he wanted to help her and shit bc he was in love and all of that but people could make weird rumors out of it so that's why they kept denying and denying until now. But iirc they've been dating since like 2021</p>
