      <p>He reposted a reply to this post but I'm pretty sure timing was it was around when he broke up w his first bf so I think this was about it it's just that the og question was specifically about ex gfs</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure he answered it himself bc it comes under the same segment he answered with posting his photos. Both these answers have his own pfp and both are under "answer"</p>
