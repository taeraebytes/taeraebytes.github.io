      <p>idk if rosins can confirm but there's a huge war on weibo rn between hao fans and the8 fans and they (8 fans) are bashing hao hard like they're talking shit there's so many horrible posts there, not sure if this also came out from there but there's no reason to believe it</p>

      <p>yeah the war is huge and crosins honestly brought some of this on themselves by being way too cocky regardless of who started it like 8stars are obv a more established fandom so now hao is just catching it from all angles</p>
