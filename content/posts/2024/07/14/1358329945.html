      <p>y'all please all of these posts are made by yxh (accounts who make money off of fanwars) who post & basically force the two fandoms to fight... the like engagements are high because weibo post engagements count comment likes as well so you're seeing two fandoms compete to get their comments at the top by mass liking comments but that doesn't actually mean it's as huge as you think it is</p>
