      <p>All this talk about Hao being careless and having a terrible digital footprint makes me think of this rumour that has run in a few haobin space that apparently Hao using hanbin as his wechat pfp multiple times and the specific pic he confirmed were rumours going around for a while so he might for real have random leakers in there cause he doesn't really care or check?</p>

      <p>Yeah that was crazy. That made it to Alice iceberg before it was confirmed (so there's legit proof of this being a rumor before being confirmed) and basically the rumor was that Hao kept using Hanbin baby pics as his WeChat pp, and then some months passed and some fan on plus chat posted a baby pic of hanbin   and Hao was like Oh I used that one as my profile pic once. So he confirmed it.

Like he's honestly just so careless.</p>

      <p>According to the anon on Alice rs I personally have no proof apparently he also posted a pic or something with his mom and hanbin eating out together before he confirmed it in a fs and I think it's believable cause it's one of the most pushy fansign he ever had he looked weirded out and it was super specific ðŸ¤” she said some rumours were probably bullshit too and some were clearly shared by nefarious or invasive means so she didn't share anything else but everyday I wonder where they shared all this and who in Haos circle is leaking this if true</p>

      <p>The thing is that Hao circle is trash. I remember that ex friend of Hao who was saying that he and Hao almost fucked once and all that bullshit also mentioning Hanbin once and saying that Hanbin was good looking and I don't remember which other crap he was saying. He has shitty ex friends.</p>

      <p>The leaks are crazy but also Zhang Hao shouldn't have replied to that fan posting the hanbin baby pic bc now the ones who got the info through the leaker are probably going to keep asking for more and more things.</p>

      <p>Tbf I've noticed the fansigns aren't as hyper specific as they were during crush era so I wonder if he cut them off already ðŸ¤”maybe the crosins mass tweak was related to that too
The only thing is that fansign about hanbin renting cars it's pretty specific but this seems like regular akgaes and not actual close people</p>
