      <p>ok but this reminds me of someone writing on a haobinist cc something like: "if hao is a dive and hanbin is a fearnot. do you think they fight bc of it?" and the haobinist replied with something like no they are not one of those gg male jobless stans or something along those lines and i remember that the tweet with the link got like 200 likes... And look at where we are now...</p>
