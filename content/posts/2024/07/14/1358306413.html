      <p>lowkey they dont want that anyway theyre just fine thinking he's hot driving with one hand i dont think it matters to them whether he's athletic bc then they start losing it about getting too fit and man-like and they need him to remain twinky and non-threatening</p>

      <p>Why would his fans care his c and k fans are always they ones asking him to keep loosing weight üò≠ they don‚Äôt want him to bulk up or be athletic. They like his chest muscles but if he were to turn up with massive biceps and a thick neck trust they would tweak.</p>

      <p>gonna go on a tangent but has rickys kfans been verbally against him working out? he still mentions working out and looks so fucking good ü§§ but I don't think I saw any riyangis complaining about his kfans complaining so Ig they're not complaining? I'm surprised maybe they like him working out too</p>

      <p>nope they were lit about it and an anon showed me they're also aware of that feminine image he has here so they hate that as well but riyangis def don't like it their reactions were insane

      <p>rukidans have never really been critical of his body tbh and they arent worried abt him overly bulking up beyond what they like bc he said himself that he wants to do it in a moderate way</p>
