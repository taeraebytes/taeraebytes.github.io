      <p>girl idk if you saw that clip but basically on this week episode myungjae and hanbin were like omg sohee is always leaving people on read and sohee was like no, let's check the chat to see who leaves people on read and they checked and basically sohee was left on read but then they said that the previous convo was myungjae sending a pic with hanbin CD (i am guessing that it was one of those solo covers) and hanbin replied and asked about what was he doing and him and jaehyun made some short convo and then sohee asked them what they were doing and that's when they left him on read and when they told the whole thing myungjae and hanbin started laughing and damn i felt bad for sohee</p>
