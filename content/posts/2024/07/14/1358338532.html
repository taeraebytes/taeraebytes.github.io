      <p>Well as you can see nothing happened like I'm sorry at the end of the day I'm aware of the consequences of running a gossip cc but what's the point if I'm not even staying true to the nature of it and also nothing I say ever hits big on twt not after I left like I get it my audience has grown but yall severely overestimate my pull and especially my credibility I have 0 on twitter. Like sorry this is a gossip cc we chat
