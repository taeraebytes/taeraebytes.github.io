Predebut hao was more straight passing (i’m not saying he’s straight I accept him regardless). If you ignore the pink hair pics, he just looked like a gorgeous normal dude. Like his famous Fujian uni pic. That’s why he had fangirls and fansites during his uni days too. \n\nAlso a lot of his kfans (outside of neulbin shippers) are gf stans. We call him male beast 😌😌. Just one chance and I will climb him like a tree!!! He knows how to feed the gf stans well (well all his different fans incl shippers too). And we are thriving!! It’s fine if he prefers men I can change his mind 😌\n\nThank u for giving us a safe space queef!! <3",

      <p>I’m original anon and idk why people are so mean :(. People are fine with hanbin having gf stans but why not hao. Predebut hao was more straight passing (i’m not saying he’s straight I accept him regardless). If you ignore the pink hair pics, he just looked like a gorgeous normal dude. Like his famous Fujian uni pic. That’s why he had fangirls and fansites during his uni days too.
