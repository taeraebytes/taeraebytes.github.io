      <p>All this talk about Hao being careless and having a terrible digital footprint makes me think of this rumour that has run in a few haobin space that apparently Hao using hanbin as his wechat pfp multiple times and the specific pic he confirmed were rumours going around for a while so he might for real have random leakers in there cause he doesn't really care or check?</p>
