      <p>Requee discussed everything about gw when nobody on the intl Twitter side was even talking about it (it blew up along Kfans majorly) I donâ€™t think she discriminates ofcourse she likes gw but she discusses everything</p>

      <p>oh me and all my gpd oomfs were crying gunwook is already so hated on the kside we didn't need more troll material and it was just heartbreaking that people believed a badly edited thread and egg that much like the acc got 10k followers in 5 hrs i was actually ready to put a gun in my mouth.. also im just a tweaker

      <p>diff anon and are they really? I'm so confused I just scrolled their acc and it seems like ur typical kfan acc that tweets w.e is on their mind and has no filter, also see them tweeting nice stuff about other members and obv not liking some members like 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/9ejtcGB1TMw3AUp/status/1811743080850317561"></a>

      <p>No shes one of those people who have love hate relationships with people they stan but I remember around bp she genuinely hated gunwook and like she's the one that's kept his hate train alive and why people troll him so hard. Like she doesn't do it herself but she makes set up posts to get him dragged like she made the soccer thing get big she got him hate for dancing to magnetic she got him hate by saying he's more handsome than eunseok she's got him hate by making fun of dazes pics like she probably likes him a little but she's like that one huge gyuvin troll that hated him so much and then started liking him but continued to get him hate ðŸ˜­ I HATE THIS GIRL BTW LIKE UGHHH SHE MAKES EVERYTHING WORSE

      <p>Ik its more normal to see tweets with more RTs than likes depending on the culture but I feel you can tell someones a troll on the k-side when 90% of their tweets are ratioed even the seemingly harmless ones. i havent checked that user in months but thats how it used to be for them and sometimes as much as 10-20k RTs all set ups</p>
