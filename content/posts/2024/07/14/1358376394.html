i have seen this melon 2-3 times and during music core in japan more than one person in my tl was saying who made jebies mad, they are performing really well, so i was wondering if something really happened before their performance, sungchan really has this weird energy after joining riize especially after all seunghan/eunseok incidents</p>

      <p>Well nobody is throwing hands but hmmmmm I wouldn't even know who would start a fight on the zb1 side and jiwoong doesn't count cuz he's barely an invested member to be caring
