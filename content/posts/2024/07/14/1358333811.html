      <p>this has been going on for 4 days and no one knew about it outside of weibo til like yesterday bc of the that twitter post from minghao fanbase and everyone thinks it’s just about the haochan thing so everybody moved on. both fandoms have brought up a lot of shit with hundreds thousand of likes that don’t have proof so everyone thinks everything they bring up now is just to fuel fanwars and not real no one cares enough about weibo war outside of it and it better stay that way</p>
