      <p>the most discussed are Hao, jiwoong for sure then I'd say Hanbin and Gunwook on a similar level then Ricky taerae and gyuvin, Yujin and Matthew have loyal fans on here but they're not usually the topic of discussion but honestly besides Matthew and Yujin we really discuss the rest a LOT like all of them for taerae it's a recent upgrade</p>

      <p>For me it's more so that we usually criticise the members in some way here and I'm not sure how ok you are with gunwook critics or even jokes about him like we do with gyub</p>

      <p>yea also true I wouldn't even know where a serious criticism would come from and trust these angry anons would be airing shit if there were bigger things. for me I'm just like that I can make anything up in my head but like my jokes get misunderstood here all the time cuz half my anons understand me😭 that's why I'm hesitant but like Pewiod he's the king say that
