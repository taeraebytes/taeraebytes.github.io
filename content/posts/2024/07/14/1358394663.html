      <p>it's funny because allins lowkey believe that hanbin had some divine birthright to be center but everyone kind of just accepted him as the center because he was the producer pick and it would cause the least drama... funny that it all ended in the most dramatic way possible and now theres a fandom blood feud because of it im sure if the narrative wasn't that he was locked 1st place in from the beginning people would have been a little more chill about him losing</p>
