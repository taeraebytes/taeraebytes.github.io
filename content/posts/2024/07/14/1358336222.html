      <p>if you're not familiar with the nugu conditions it's CRAZY like i wouldnt suggest trying this unless you're going to big 4 guaranteed success the amount of stories ive heard of fucked up dorms, 20 dollars per day for a 6 member group to split to pay for meals these companies will treat you as poorly as they're allowed to and i'll bet it's even worse if you're not korean and can't advocate for yourself</p>
