      <p>This had to be for something personal because there’s no way they would send him out without staff or a company car</p>

 popped up on my tl and I'm ot9 (trying to be) so I see everything 😭 I def seen more riyangis being vocal about calling out certain riyangis when they're clearly spreading misinfo for a certain agenda and I think more and more are slowly realizing how damaging it can be. But yeah I think theyre a minority tho</p>
