      <p>This is kinda funny bc i feel like allins only tweak like once a month but they definitely don't even care about the rosins vs Allins beef anymore as they used to do.</p>

      <p>"allins tweak once a month" they were calling yuehuaz wakeone favs over youtube thumbnails when hanbin was getting solo gigs back to back and because of a magazine behind he got a few days letter, say hariboz should go back to china everyday and they can't be famous in korea bc they're Chinese and etc ntm they token stan a new member every week maybe they're not as loud as before i also don't care about them as much but i see my moots quoting them on private so i can still see those losers are still just as bad</p>

      <p>allins are just easier to disregard bc they're less powerful in mass than rosins (in eng/chn spaces, idk about others) and their mistreatment narratives are extremely and repetitively unconvincing to every other sf which is not to say other fans' narratives arent exaggerated or insincere sometimes but like c'mon no one likes a sympathy hog especially when its over shit like not being retweeted enough on main or being in the middle of the line/screen distributions</p>
