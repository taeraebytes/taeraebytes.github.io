      <p>I think ftp was alright the issue is it's super mediocre like it feels like wakeone works with very little artists and that their producers don't meet with the group, this is a song that was made to be liked by the public not a song that was made with a specific creative vision in mind</p>

      <p>i really wonder about the production process for this group because nothing about their music seems serious not only is most of it mid but the production sounds so weird on everything and their music isnt even all produced by the same people it's so strange</p>
