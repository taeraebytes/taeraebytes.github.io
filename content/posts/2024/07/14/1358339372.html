      <p>Yea dream was kind of a stupid choice since they were more popular in sea and korea but 127 had a hold on the west

      <p>127 is actually a great case of heavy promo in a country that actually worked, cause lets be honest bts was reigning supreme but sm still decided to say fck it and lets try. and it actually worked like by pandemic and kick it era 127 had solid american fanbase that topped many other groups and over there nct dream was just an afterthought if u were a nctzen u were a 127zen and thats that dhfdhjfdf</p>
