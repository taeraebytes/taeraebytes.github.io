      <p>Also on my last point about apologising it's why I wish hanbin and Taerae would stop addressing EVERYTHING it becomes si abundantly clear to your whole audience that you're hyper aware and insecure like be a little more nonchalant and assertive please!!! Hao with his non direct blow ups is bad too, control your emotions don't let too much of yourself to your insane audience ESPECIALLY if you don't like them</p>

      <p>Hanbin’s only every publicly apologised for two things and both those things needed an apology but I agree with Taerae directly adressing his fans complaints about the hair for example like don’t give too much power there</p>
