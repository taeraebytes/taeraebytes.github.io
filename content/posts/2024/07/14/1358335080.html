      <p>To move onto another topic theres a whole discussion that got opened up about female and male idols interacting bc of haos tiktok thing, but also about how fans use gay as a shield for their idols.  and korean feminists got some points in about how kfangirls always use gay as a way to deflect their idols from being a regular hannam. But some zh fans that are lwokey trolls were trying to convince them zh is an actual gay in the qrtssdfhjbdsjsdf</p>
