      <p>I’m original anon and idk why people are so mean :(. People are fine with hanbin having gf stans but why not hao. Predebut hao was more straight passing (i’m not saying he’s straight I accept him regardless). If you ignore the pink hair pics, he just looked like a gorgeous normal dude. Like his famous Fujian uni pic. That’s why he had fangirls and fansites during his uni days too. 

Also a lot of his kfans (outside of neulbin shippers) are gf stans. We call him male beast 😌😌. Just one chance and I will climb him like a tree!!! He knows how to feed the gf stans well (well all his different fans incl shippers too). And we are thriving!! It’s fine if he prefers men I can change his mind 😌

Thank u for giving us a safe space queef!! <3</p>

      <p>HBDNDNFNGNFKGKKFKDKMDMDK I just think it doesn't matter if he had gf Stan's cuz we have no confirmation and even if we did why does it matter. And yuppppp his kfans are gf fans down I spaced w some k rosins and they screamed at me for calling him gay 😭
