      <p>The people making it bigger were the rosins acting like the group would disband ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I didn't think it was worth the dramatics but here we are 5 hours later we're still fine

      <p>well i am someone who loves to share things with people, and it's not like nobody knows huangzi, she has a huge following ( i have been following her since i think 2020) so people who follow her or have access to weibo will always bring these here like the zhihu account ( which i think is the same account melody2k used to talk about)</p>
