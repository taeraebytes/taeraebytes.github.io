      <p>Requee discussed everything about gw when nobody on the intl Twitter side was even talking about it (it blew up along Kfans majorly) I donâ€™t think she discriminates ofcourse she likes gw but she discusses everything</p>

      <p>oh me and all my gpd oomfs were crying gunwook is already so hated on the kside we didn't need more troll material and it was just heartbreaking that people believed a badly edited thread and egg that much like the acc got 10k followers in 5 hrs i was actually ready to put a gun in my mouth.. also im just a tweaker

      <p>They've been around since bp they have luterally been tweeting gunwook shade since March 2023 they're not a fan and they're just more a general troll acc like bp had crazy trolls tuning and stanning a lot of the visual ctrainees she's that breed and she's like bffs with bbosongeee but she's just made everything harder for gunwook she's kept his hate train alive the whole soccer thing was her fault too
