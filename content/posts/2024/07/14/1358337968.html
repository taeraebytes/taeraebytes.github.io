      <p>To move onto another topic theres a whole discussion that got opened up about female and male idols interacting bc of haos tiktok thing, but also about how fans use gay as a shield for their idols.  and korean feminists got some points in about how kfangirls always use gay as a way to deflect their idols from being a regular hannam. But some zh fans that are lwokey trolls were trying to convince them zh is an actual gay in the qrtssdfhjbdsjsdf</p>

      <p>Im gonna be honest feminism in korea is its whole different genre, i get it because they had to adapt to try to protect themselves and other women from the terrible men there. but to outright call urself a feminist on twt, u usually would not be stanning a man and they are closer to a radfem where they genuinely even hate on male children</p>

      <p>Yea I understand that it has to be really extreme in order to protect themselves but I just didn't get that part but again I'd never understand like them. But hating on little boys jfjdnngmvmfmis well seeing the anti woman turn over I'd assume too
