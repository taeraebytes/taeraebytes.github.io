      <p>Yea we've been speculating here and so has Chanel that they wanted to drop him but probably took him back for the sake of the relationship w hanbin but he's like a last choice member to them

      <p>I kept this quite for ages but I have a moot who says they know someone who knows a lot of stuff / people and I didn't believe them but they said the theme of ftp would be cowboys and tennis and it was so I was like shit maybe they do know people. I remember a couple months before around March time they were spilling some tea on wakeone almost loosing a deal for hanbin but they never said which brand but could it be this?</p>

      <p>Possibly the theory we came up with was that they dropped jiwoong and wakeone stupidly made an ultimatum to get him back on which could've resulted in hanbin losing Gucci as well. But did ur moot say anything else of interest ab the group? Like I just wanna know if we're in good hands
