      <p>allins are just easier to disregard bc they're less powerful in mass than rosins (in eng/chn spaces, idk about others) and their mistreatment narratives are extremely and repetitively unconvincing to every other sf which is not to say other fans' narratives arent exaggerated or insincere sometimes but like c'mon no one likes a sympathy hog especially when its over shit like not being retweeted enough on main or being in the middle of the line/screen distributions</p>
