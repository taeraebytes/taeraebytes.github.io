      <p>was on aestas cc and kinda stole the idea but ugh wow making a bit of an exclusive private discord server would be smart like we need that. I'd have to figure out how to turn off invites and get crazy ab who joins but give me ideas</p>

      <p>Oh I have an alt and nobody knows me it's just up to me to pick the right people like hmmm we gotta do interviews but I feel like the server is much needed at this point I'd want it to remain small too

      <p>Nope I'll stay just as active but I don't have it in me to fight everyday and I miss the more radical discussions so a little corners just easier to deal with
