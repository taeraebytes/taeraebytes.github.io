      <p>All this talk about Hao being careless and having a terrible digital footprint makes me think of this rumour that has run in a few haobin space that apparently Hao using hanbin as his wechat pfp multiple times and the specific pic he confirmed were rumours going around for a while so he might for real have random leakers in there cause he doesn't really care or check?</p>

      <p>Yeah that was crazy. That made it to Alice iceberg before it was confirmed (so there's legit proof of this being a rumor before being confirmed) and basically the rumor was that Hao kept using Hanbin baby pics as his WeChat pp, and then some months passed and some fan on plus chat posted a baby pic of hanbin   and Hao was like Oh I used that one as my profile pic once. So he confirmed it.

Like he's honestly just so careless.</p>
