      <p>not anon but I've never being fan of english speaking idol so they're pretty much not real to me but since matthew acknowledges and interacts a lot with ifans he seems pretty close to me so I got jealous af whenever he interact with sofia or the white girl like boy are u dating them or what? what about me? 🤨🤨 maybe that's why allins tweaking over hanbin and that shelby girls interactions</p>
