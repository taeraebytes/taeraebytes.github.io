      <p>i don't wanna sound like those gg stans that go "if it was a woman" or shit like that but you guys are really underestimating how much a male idol can get away with things, he'll be fine because his fans won't leave and that's all that matters for male idols anyways, people may use it on fanwars but that's it, the group will be as fine as it was yesterday there's no need to be dramatic üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the only good thing about having someone like jiwoong in the group it's that his controversies overshadow the ones of the other members so he's the first one to get dragged and the other guys just receive minimal heat</p>
