      <p>To move onto another topic theres a whole discussion that got opened up about female and male idols interacting bc of haos tiktok thing, but also about how fans use gay as a shield for their idols.  and korean feminists got some points in about how kfangirls always use gay as a way to deflect their idols from being a regular hannam. But some zh fans that are lwokey trolls were trying to convince them zh is an actual gay in the qrtssdfhjbdsjsdf</p>

      <p>Im gonna be honest feminism in korea is its whole different genre, i get it because they had to adapt to try to protect themselves and other women from the terrible men there. but to outright call urself a feminist on twt, u usually would not be stanning a man and they are closer to a radfem where they genuinely even hate on male children</p>

      <p>Yea I understand that it has to be really extreme in order to protect themselves but I just didn't get that part but again I'd never understand like them. But hating on little boys jfjdnngmvmfmis well seeing the anti woman turn over I'd assume too

      <p>No... I know about radical feminism too and men who socialize with women are not deemed as misogynistic or anything bc of it. Radical feminism wants women to separate from men and stop interacting and associating with them, and if women don't do it they just think that they are not radical feminist and just libs. And also radical feminism also thinks that since men were born in a society that favors them, even if they are not some crazy POS who shits on women 24/7, they still think that all of them have misogynistic traits bc they were born on this society and it's something that all men need to work on so they can delete that mindset.</p>

      <p>ouuuu but I can kinda agree with that it's like a spectrum of misogyny to me unless they were raised anti misogynistic which is like ... 0.1% I always assume there's a some there
