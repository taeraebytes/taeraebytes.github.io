      <p>the most discussed are Hao, jiwoong for sure then I'd say Hanbin and Gunwook on a similar level then Ricky taerae and gyuvin, Yujin and Matthew have loyal fans on here but they're not usually the topic of discussion but honestly besides Matthew and Yujin we really discuss the rest a LOT like all of them for taerae it's a recent upgrade</p>
