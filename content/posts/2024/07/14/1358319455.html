      <p>Weibo fights can get so nasty and messy a few days ago ningning and winter stans were fighting because they both sang heya by ive in one of their content and you know how that song was perceived in china ðŸ˜­ ningning fans were accusing winter of asking her to sing it and the others were accusing ningning of betraying her country for singing it like it was bad</p>
