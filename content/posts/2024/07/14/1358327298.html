      <p>He reposted a reply to this post but I'm pretty sure timing was it was around when he broke up w his first bf so I think this was about it it's just that the og question was specifically about ex gfs</p>

      <p>Q: Do you still remember that girl that you loved before how are they doing now?

Repost A:
I don't want to know. Where there is love, there is also resent.

Scared that the other person is doing well, but also scared that the other person isn't doing well...</p>
