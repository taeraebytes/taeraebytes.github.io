      <p>Idk if you guys saw that empire state of mind that someone did with 127 but omg that edit still gives me goosebumps. 127 ran the states idc. 

They could be royalty and more but sm decided to favor nct dream like fuck them.</p>

      <p>Yea dream was kind of a stupid choice since they were more popular in sea and korea but 127 had a hold on the west

      <p>Speaking of do you guys think slowly but surely it's over for Hybe and sm? Clearly things have been crumbling for a while but they're still dominating the Market for now, what will it take for them to fall for good or will it just be a slow process like yg</p>

      <p>hybe... no for sm it's just that they're no longer living up the name but they can still produce quality but they're dying from the inside and aren't as big
