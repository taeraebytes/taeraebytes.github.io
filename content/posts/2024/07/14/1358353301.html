      <p>I think he's just not comfortable with his English yet even tho he's learning sooo fast and he's not as americaboo as you'd think it's just he loves western music and Matthew. He likes to joke with his fans and they tease him a lot so it's just easier to create that really fun and fast paced environment with the Korean fans I wish we got some interaction but it's still fun regardless
