      <p>I would’ve opened a dedicated hate page for him if he did that. Gunwook isn’t even my fav but I felt bad for him 😭 he not only pushed him hard to the point he nearly tripped but also later when they were trying to pin the opponent down, jiwoong was so unnecessarily aggressive like gunwook was even saying that he’s scared</p>
