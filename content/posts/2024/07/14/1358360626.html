      <p>Oh I have an alt and nobody knows me it's just up to me to pick the right people like hmmm we gotta do interviews but I feel like the server is much needed at this point I'd want it to remain small too

      <p>Nope I'll stay just as active but I don't have it in me to fight everyday and I miss the more radical discussions so a little corners just easier to deal with
