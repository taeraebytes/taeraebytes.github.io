      <p>Thatâ€™s a lie sheâ€™s friends with multiple of the girls and while she wasnâ€™t my pick I think she will be a good addition. All throughout the show she was the only one who Iâ€™d say had a consistent â€˜for the groupâ€™ mentality rather then individualistic and always took lesser parts and never contested for more when it was in the best interest of the team and she was always helpful to the other girls where she could be. Do I think she should have debuted, no, but she is and she wonâ€™t be a bad addition in any sense.</p>
