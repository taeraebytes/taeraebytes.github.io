      <p>lowkey i was also thinking they chose a day without hanbin to have female guests bc hanbin gets shipped with female idols (well mostly karina) for his prince-like visuals since fans like that and they might start dating rumours, no one's gonna ship goofy ass fanboy and chum chum with stayc girls üò≠</p>

      <p>That's what I thought too like not to be blunt but myungjae and sohee aren't good looking and also don't have the big fanbase Hanbin has especially one as schizophrenic as allins (Hanbin was still apologising for missing mcd today like the man is SCARED) I think they're realllyyyy worried about the reactions esp since Hanbin is very comfortable with women</p>
