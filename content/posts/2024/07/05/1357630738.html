      <p>I started crying as soon as I saw what they did to taerae ðŸ™‚ðŸ”«

the fact that theyâ€™re doing this to him when his entire kr fandom is still traumatized by the purple hair is insane I genuinely canâ€™t believe it. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re actively trying to make all of his fans leave
this is the #1 thing that they have a problem with and itâ€™s also their ONLY REASONABLE DEMAND?? like i donâ€™t think itâ€™s unreasonable for people to want him to have eyebrows and hair on his scalpâ€¦?
I love him and Iâ€™ll never leave no matter what but I canâ€™t even blame people for leaving at this point Like the entire period where he had purple hair was so fucking miserable EVEN AZURE LEFT LMFAO

HE HAS NO EYEBROWSâ€¦..THEYâ€™RE GONEEEEE</p>
