      <p>I mean yujin was part of the lineup why would he get pd picked but no the producers didn't care ab keita we definitely would've had to get park shitbin if it was up to the pds and they would've replaced taerae or ricky

      <p>No I meant with our line up cuz ricky was 4 and taerae was 6 and and yujin and jiwoong was 8 and 9 so they'd be our ver of 'pd' pick</p>

      <p>diff anon and I think they'd go for keita tbh. the pds were equally sucking both their dicks maybe an extra luck for phanbin but think they really wanted a Japanese member in no matter what knowing how important the Japanese market is (ofc now we know we don't need a Japanese member to still do really good but back then they didn't know) and personally phanbin just gives me bad vibes</p>

      <p>Keita...? So the group could be massacred before they stepped out yea nah keita was HATED in korea severely and hanbin was liked idt they'd choose him over phanbin and they don't even need a Japanese member for that gunwook got the most votes from japan anyways those ppl dgaf😭

      <p>True like at least phb isnt THAT hated (i think his controversy would have blown up if he was zb1 though), keita in zb1 is instant suicide where they wouldnt even be allowed to gain the kfanbase they have now, most ppl would drop the group from the beginning. and intl fans dont want to stan a group that doesnt set the same records as x1/iz1 so likely they would have less intl interest too. and thats coming from me i bias keita, but people were going to monks to pray he didnt debut bruh💀</p>
