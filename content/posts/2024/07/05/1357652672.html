      <p>suddenly the iland storyteller job is "important". it probably has one of the worst viewership ratings for a survival show from mnet but alright ðŸ˜‚ this discussion is getting boring real fast cause its always the same anons having the same opinions about hbs different jobs</p>

      <p>ok hes not some industry plant fr but people see him as one bc cj does too much for him compared to the others ofc it canâ€™t be compared to what sm or hybe can do for their artists cj is small scale but they still back him up like crazy in the industry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ even non fans think cj does too much and provide so much for zb1 individually bc of his gigs when thatâ€™s not the case at all for all the members</p>

      <p>hybe is not stronger than cjnm i promise you ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ hybe's biggest strength is a lot of company stan while cjnm has connections everywhere; many subsidiaries, several cable TV channels and so on. hybe's rookie idols don't even have solo osts but zb1 has 3 and two of them are for big show (love transite, queen of tears), then one of them is a month after debut ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>even if it is the OSTs is the most they've done for the group they haven't pulled much else and hybe literally buys AMBASSADORSHIPS... for their idols ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ cj may control things but hybe and sm work things outside of that thatre pretty important as well
