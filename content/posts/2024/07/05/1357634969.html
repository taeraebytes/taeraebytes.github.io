      <p>hanbin actually looks good, i think he coloured it yesterday thats why it seems a bit off to me, after a few days it will look better. especially in his clip he looks really nice

      <p>no he really doesnâ€™t look like hao ðŸ˜­ idk why but this cracked me up itâ€™s like ur vision cleared but it cleared towards the wrong side? haobinists have been gaslighting the haobin lookalike thing and u resisted it all these months only for u to accept it at a time when they def donâ€™t look alike ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
