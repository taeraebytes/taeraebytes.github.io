      <p>He got angel lighting from being unscathed from riizes plethora of monthly scandals, he has a cuter image from the group and he's the main vocal of the group he's so essential that you can't really hate on him if you like the group it's also riize getting popular that just automatically gives him positive attention. I honestly saw it coming but nobody likes his visuals still he's just been on good behavior and he's rising in popularity so they can kick it w him
