      <p>ehhh not really i know for sure hao is not renewing because in every yuehua report they keep emphasizing on him and they have plans for him etc they'd be stupid to let him renew when he can bring them more profit than when he's under wakeone</p>

      <p>I agree it‚Äôs less about looks rather than general perception I mean look at runext and iland they were practically pushing out anyone that was close to 20s. Also 7 years isn‚Äôt big when you consider the know eachother but remember Yujin probably won‚Äôt be the maknae at 18/19 and there very well could be someone with a 10+ year age gap there, rather than it being acceptable do you think at 26 with an established career that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs going to want.</p>
