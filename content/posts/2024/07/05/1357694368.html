      <p>sungchan is rlly handsome but he's not striking and that's why he never would've been the riize center over wonbin who easily fluctuates and has more of a controversial visual but they're all good looking it comes to preference and charisma and I feel like jiwoong had it he just is ruined and yujins growing it
