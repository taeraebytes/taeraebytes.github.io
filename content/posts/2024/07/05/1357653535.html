      <p>ok hes not some industry plant fr but people see him as one bc cj does too much for him compared to the others ofc it can’t be compared to what sm or hybe can do for their artists cj is small scale but they still back him up like crazy in the industry 😭😭 even non fans think cj does too much and provide so much for zb1 individually bc of his gigs when that’s not the case at all for all the members</p>

      <p>hybe is not stronger than cjnm i promise you 😭 😭 hybe's biggest strength is a lot of company stan while cjnm has connections everywhere; many subsidiaries, several cable TV channels and so on. hybe's rookie idols don't even have solo osts but zb1 has 3 and two of them are for big show (love transite, queen of tears), then one of them is a month after debut 😭😭😭</p>

      <p>even if it is the OSTs is the most they've done for the group they haven't pulled much else and hybe literally buys AMBASSADORSHIPS... for their idols 😭😭 cj may control things but hybe and sm work things outside of that thatre pretty important as well

      <p>Like why do literally no one to1 or kep1er had cj payola obviously zb1 got gigs through their connections but also because they actually have demand, they're under wakeone not remotely directly under cj

Literally any idol debuting under SM and hybe is guaranteed some kind of success, heavy promo, huge connections with the entire industry and financial security, it isn't even remotely comparable</p>

      <p>Also another thing I was gonna point out zb1 are under wakeone known to sabotage idols while hybe idols or sm idols ARE DIRECTLY OR ALMOST DIRECTLY INFLUENCED😭😭😭😭 it's in no way comparable when there's more than the connection the name alone is enough to give you hype wakeone isn't publicly recognized to be attached to cj like that and it's an affiliate company... sorry this convo is crazy like what're u even talking ab 😭
