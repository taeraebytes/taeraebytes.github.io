      <p>suddenly the iland storyteller job is "important". it probably has one of the worst viewership ratings for a survival show from mnet but alright 😂 this discussion is getting boring real fast cause its always the same anons having the same opinions about hbs different jobs</p>

      <p>ok hes not some industry plant fr but people see him as one bc cj does too much for him compared to the others ofc it can’t be compared to what sm or hybe can do for their artists cj is small scale but they still back him up like crazy in the industry 😭😭 even non fans think cj does too much and provide so much for zb1 individually bc of his gigs when that’s not the case at all for all the members</p>

      <p>hybe is not stronger than cjnm i promise you 😭 😭 hybe's biggest strength is a lot of company stan while cjnm has connections everywhere; many subsidiaries, several cable TV channels and so on. hybe's rookie idols don't even have solo osts but zb1 has 3 and two of them are for big show (love transite, queen of tears), then one of them is a month after debut 😭😭😭</p>

      <p>even if it is the OSTs is the most they've done for the group they haven't pulled much else and hybe literally buys AMBASSADORSHIPS... for their idols 😭😭 cj may control things but hybe and sm work things outside of that thatre pretty important as well
