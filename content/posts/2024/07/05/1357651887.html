      <p>ok hes not some industry plant fr but people see him as one bc cj does too much for him compared to the others ofc it canâ€™t be compared to what sm or hybe can do for their artists cj is small scale but they still back him up like crazy in the industry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ even non fans think cj does too much and provide so much for zb1 individually bc of his gigs when thatâ€™s not the case at all for all the members</p>
