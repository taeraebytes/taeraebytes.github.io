      <p>suddenly the iland storyteller job is "important". it probably has one of the worst viewership ratings for a survival show from mnet but alright 😂 this discussion is getting boring real fast cause its always the same anons having the same opinions about hbs different jobs</p>

      <p>no he is getting called that because go to their socmed accounts and scroll through, give twitter a go 
also being a survival show mc, having the privilege to announce the final lineup and replace one of the trendiest actors of 2024 is not tiny but you do you</p>

      <p>Right because even with song kang as the mc the ratings stayed on the floor and the 13 people watching the show hated him.. song kang just like every other factor of the show did absolutely nothing being a hybe show didn't help having rose sing their signal song didn't help having tbl mentors didn't help having taeyang as a judge didn't help and even somi as the co mc didn't help...............

      <p>I’ve been seeing this discourse for a while but actually rosins tweaking about the groups twitter, which mind you is their least followed socmed, being full of hanbin like 90% of that shit isn’t just mca rt and a weekly mca zerofocus. It’s the same reason yujins post numbers are now spiking on the groups X because he has a weekly job they rt. Also why do you guys always tweak over x but not the other social media because I remember a good period of time where every other insta post was hao and every other tiktok was him too and he still leads post wise on both platforms .</p>

      <p>omg I rmbr when hao was every damn tiktok video I WAS GETTING IRKED😭 and their twitter is so inactive its only retweets from current schedules so only hanbin and yujin the members rarely post🤦‍♀️ i get it since most fans operate on twitter so you just look towards that socmed acc more but yea there's other social medias that people constantly leave out I just feel like dying over this is dumb atp like we ain got time for that🤦‍♀️
