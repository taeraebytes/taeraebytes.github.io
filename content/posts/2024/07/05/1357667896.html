      <p>no he is getting called that because go to their socmed accounts and scroll through, give twitter a go 
also being a survival show mc, having the privilege to announce the final lineup and replace one of the trendiest actors of 2024 is not tiny but you do you</p>

      <p>Right because even with song kang as the mc the ratings stayed on the floor and the 13 people watching the show hated him.. song kang just like every other factor of the show did absolutely nothing being a hybe show didn't help having rose sing their signal song didn't help having tbl mentors didn't help having taeyang as a judge didn't help and even somi as the co mc didn't help...............
