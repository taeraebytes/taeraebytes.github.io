    "question": "what were ur thoughts on cheeky icy thang? i get why it’s so divisive bc the “i’m cool as ice” bit in the chorus sounds a bit weird with the high instrumental and then vocals, tho i got used to it, and the title is odd but i personally quite like it bc it reminds me of old kpop like, idk, t-ara and it sounds closer to their run 2 u/so bad sound which i much prefer over teddy bear/bubble",
    "reply": "I've only heard the chorus snippets and I'm honestly confused as to why everyone's so mad I rlly liked it I see the run2u comparisons but the beat is wayyy better I liked it"
