      <p>hanbin actually looks good, i think he coloured it yesterday thats why it seems a bit off to me, after a few days it will look better. especially in his clip he looks really nice

      <p>no he really doesn’t look like hao 😭 idk why but this cracked me up it’s like ur vision cleared but it cleared towards the wrong side? haobinists have been gaslighting the haobin lookalike thing and u resisted it all these months only for u to accept it at a time when they def don’t look alike 😭😭😭😭</p>

      <p>I see a resemblance I think hanbin and yujin looks strongly alike Hanbin just has a strong jaw and when I pass blond Hanbin picture sometimes he looks like blond Hao but Hao doesn't look like yujin but they have similar vibes, both hanbin and yujin can also kinda look like gunwook at times but not Hao and yujin sometimes also looks like Ricky lmao I think when they debuted a lot say they all look similar and I agree</p>
