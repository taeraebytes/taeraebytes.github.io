      <p>I started crying as soon as I saw what they did to taerae ðŸ™‚ðŸ”«

the fact that theyâ€™re doing this to him when his entire kr fandom is still traumatized by the purple hair is insane I genuinely canâ€™t believe it. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re actively trying to make all of his fans leave
this is the #1 thing that they have a problem with and itâ€™s also their ONLY REASONABLE DEMAND?? like i donâ€™t think itâ€™s unreasonable for people to want him to have eyebrows and hair on his scalpâ€¦?
I love him and Iâ€™ll never leave no matter what but I canâ€™t even blame people for leaving at this point Like the entire period where he had purple hair was so fucking miserable EVEN AZURE LEFT LMFAO

HE HAS NO EYEBROWSâ€¦..THEYâ€™RE GONEEEEE</p>

Iâ€™ve seen surprisingly few complaints so far Iâ€™ve mostly seen them saying that it looks good and telling ppl not to say anything bad in public because heâ€™ll see it
but theyâ€™re definitely all committing mass suicide on their private accounts right now like they went from having pretty much exactly what they wanted after suffering through the purple hair poverty for months and then having it taken away from them almost immediately and replaced with something far worse than the purple
 

iâ€™m pretty sure his goal is to literally have white hair. like he has been fixated on this idea for soo long now but he needs to GIVE UP They already bleached it 5 times and itâ€™s NOT HAPPENING</p>
