      <p>Hao blonde was better, it gave him a popular viral post in theqoo and he got hit tweets in k side of the fandom and the koreans loved it. I don't see anyone enjoying hanbin's hair, and tbh it doesn't look that good.</p>

      <p>People are enjoying Hanbin’s hair what are you saying ? And whenever you do such a drastic change you’ll get some mixed opinions but I didn’t see anyone openly hate it or call it ugly and all the Kfans I follow have been gushing over it, it received multiple hit tweets too on the kside as well as the intl side so idk what’s up, even the whole instiz is filled with only praise, there are multiple posts on pann too talking about how blonde suits him well too. Even the fans who attended the finale were all tweeting about how he is looking more like an ice prince</p>
