      <p>kfans love yujin-hao-ricky combo down but i dont see them involve gyuvin when talking about yuehuaz that much and he's even the one who keeps mentioning it üò≠ this is what he gets for 2binz that demonic ass duo</p>

      <p>It's kind of not that big anymore and I'm seeing more and more ppl shit on the ship and since gyuvin dropped yujin nothings keeping it alive i think yujin fans like the DUO (not ship nobody say anything weird) with hao more now

      <p>That ship still gets many postype stories though. The nb ship has gone down a bit though. Probably because zb1 isn't as popular as before.</p>

      <p>there isn‚Äôt that much material anymore so i think that‚Äôs why it feels like they‚Äôre not as big anymore. but that one fansign where they posed together in the adidas jackets fans went crazy.</p>

      <p>Wakeone were dumb to not capitalise off of Gyujin at all, I'm not saying fanservice or interactions I don't think they really interact or are close, but pictorials or duo photoshoot etc in general I'm always dumbfounded that they don't really profit off of the maknae line</p>

      <p>They definitely should have gotten that duo content or pictorial like for dazed, giving that for the group but keeping the other one for woongsungz in the midst of ssibal gate was crazy. 
I think that given the overly positive reaction to naughty they should have a full cover for the tour, I'm just not sure what to do with the rest of the members 
Gunwook Yujin 
Matthew Ricky 
Gyuvin Matthew

      <p>Idc im glad the dazed shoot turned into a group thing but they def could've got a duo mag after and yes a full cover would be so good on tour 
And do u mean duo mags or like performances? hmmm I can see some dance thing for maknaez and then rnb performance for mattrick the rest can kick rocks like idk we're not doing gyuvin and jiwoong... taerae erm idk

      <p>For the groups for the tour it's probably gonna be 3 groups of 3 so imo
Hanbin Hao Jiwoong (he needs to be somewhere so hyung line+haobin hype will cover him up) they can do NCT perfume 
Ricky Matthew Gyuvin (English speakers they can cover an English RnB song like uuuuh soldier destiny's child)
Gunwook Yujin Taerae (gunjin can have a duo breakdance moment and Taerae can cover the vocals they can do exo blooming days)</p>
