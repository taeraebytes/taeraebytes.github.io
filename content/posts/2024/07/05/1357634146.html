      <p>Hao blonde was better, it gave him a popular viral post in theqoo and he got hit tweets in k side of the fandom and the koreans loved it. I don't see anyone enjoying hanbin's hair, and tbh it doesn't look that good.</p>

      <p>People are enjoying Hanbin‚Äôs hair what are you saying ? And whenever you do such a drastic change you‚Äôll get some mixed opinions but I didn‚Äôt see anyone openly hate it or call it ugly and all the Kfans I follow have been gushing over it, it received multiple hit tweets too on the kside as well as the intl side so idk what‚Äôs up, even the whole instiz is filled with only praise, there are multiple posts on pann too talking about how blonde suits him well too.
