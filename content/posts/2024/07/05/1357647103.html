      <p>what are they getting??? if you're talking about big company payola it's for their entire groups like i wish we had that payola for zb1 and their charts and  even the most popular ones like wonbin and shinyu have zero solo gigs and also cj is literally just as big they have connections in every single corner of the industry please</p>

      <p>I'm aware it's group stuff but nothing hanbin has gotten is on the level so how r we calling this broke dh gate level payola biggest industry plant stuff like come on😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 and yes cj is capable but clearly they don't care because it's been a year and they've barely pulled strings for the whole group outside of 2 weeks of in bloom promo like i can call hanbin favored or privileged but this is no "biggest industry plant" stuff... HE MCED FOR THE WORST SURVIVAL SHOW EVER 😭😭😭😭😭😭 all im saying is to call him the biggest industry plant is crazy yall haven't seen nothing big yet

      <p>wonbin didn't get 10% of what hanbin got since debut and media play can only do so much they're not forcing people to like him tf 😭 i know big company privilege is a thing but let's be real actually</p>

      <p>ur underestimating just how much media play he got and how much it works like how do u think propaganda works😭 like if someone is everywhere 24/7 and hyped 24/7 it's a fake it till you make it kinda thing it's how new jeans got famous and it's how like literally everyone in this day and age gets famous even outside of kpop it eventually turns into real hype
