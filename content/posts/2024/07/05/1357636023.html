      <p>My thoughts:
I loved Hanbins blond moment actually!! Didn't expect it but he looks really soft, I hope they go fully white and silver next let's get the full ice prince look
Hao is superr handsome wow I was surprised every time I saw a clip of him outside of the hair I think times and times again despite his personal preference for colorful clothes it's proven that dark clothes are IT for him
It took me a moment to get used to Yujin light brown hair eh I still feel like he should've been the permanently black hair members but it's not bad he looks very anime like, I'd love to see him go blond next actually 
Unpopular I see the blond taerae vision they just need to tone it and darken his brows but I feel like it'll fit him idk

I love that they picked some unexpected members like Hanbin and yujin for color change
Prediction for the rest
Ricky and jiwoong still black 
Matthew back to brown
Jiwoong silver
Gunwook flashy red
Gyuvin brownish red</p>

      <p>It took some time to grow on me but I rlly like the icy ash moment he stands out in a different way now I wonder how it'll work with a summer cb

and omg haos hair gagged me we needed that so bad I love that it's darker than the og wine red and yea he needs to get in Ricky's closet asap

Me too it took me a while to adjust to yujin hair but now it's actually my favorite he looks sooook gorgeous 

SAME AGAIN I was saying I weirdly like it like I can see where this is supposed to go it's def not the final product 

Gunwook said everyone changed their hair so smth had to have changed with Ricky and jiwoong idk..
But Matthew needs that's honey blond again 

But ouuu gyuwook red I want to see gunwook in a deeper red flashy red omo don't scare me
