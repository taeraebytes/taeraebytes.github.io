      <p>did gyuvin not get whacked for saying that hanbin isn't qualified to do the zipline bc he doesn't fit the weight limit (30-100kg) in the new busan video and it's clear what he was implying ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i don't go to that demonic side of twitter for a reason but i wouldn't be surprised if allins were like "aw uri silly 2binz, gyuvin loves hanbin so much" about it wow the nugu member privilege is crazy.... idc too much i'm used to kpop weight talk especially with zb1 but i'm just a bit surprised no one gaf</p>
