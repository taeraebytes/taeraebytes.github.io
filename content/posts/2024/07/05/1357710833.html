      <p>Anon do you have a link because I‚Äôve just filtered though the entire account with his name and the only articles I see for him are job related 

His allure shoot with kenzo 
His iland mc role 
Mca mc with Yujin and Gunwook 
Mc mc announcement 
His ost release 

Not a single one about him being a leader or calling him a golden leader</p>
