      <p>I’m actually so irate because I’ve been waiting for ggs to be invited to the mca live for ages and the one week they finally are hanbin isn’t even there and the mcs are so bad I can fully see these companies never again agreeing to letting their gg go there. Like how’d they actually ruin this for us. Should have appreciated that miyeon hanbin duo more like istg get another female mc please.</p>

      <p>Like literally so unfair to female idols like:
-Yes daechinso is small but it's still promo and a form of a promo you don't have access to bcs of your gender
-You get in and the mcs are supperrr awkward with you 
-You still try to make conversation even though if there's backlash most of it will fall on you 
-they stay dry and awkward and make you feel unwelcomed</p>
