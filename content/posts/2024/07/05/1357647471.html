      <p>I like the lineup but no gunwooks gonna be the bastard child😑...... yuehua fans already have an allegiance to one another (these whores also used to be some of gunwooks biggest haters..) and the members themselves have time on gunwook like the company squashing their own groups aside I CANT SUBJECT GUNWOOK TO ALIENATION!!!!!!!!!!! I do like the lineup tho

      <p>kfans love yujin-hao-ricky combo down but i dont see them involve gyuvin when talking about yuehuaz that much and he's even the one who keeps mentioning it 😭 this is what he gets for 2binz that demonic ass duo</p>

      <p>I think it's partially cause he completely gave up Yujin after bp and ris don't like him for Valid reasons, I have no idea why rosins don't like him tho is it just the Hanbin proximity?</p>
