      <p>Gunwook needs to start Yujin son agenda which is corny but atleast we will get rid of mattwook fanfics, Gunwook ain't obessed with mathew you all need to chill please, they are projecting Gunwook as someone hungry for Matthew attention but Matt is in love with jiwoong writing some cringey ass love triangle fanfics.</p>
