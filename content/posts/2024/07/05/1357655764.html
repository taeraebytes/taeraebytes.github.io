      <p>lmao wasn't there a rumour some months ago that he was gonna be in a short web drama? that was for sure fake but i could see them pushing him in the acting direction bc of his visuals but they really shouldn't like he's just so awks omg, just push the dance prodigy and maknae image, then also get him to improve vocals like a taemin 2.0</p>

      <p>I mean yeah Taemin was shit but you also have to be born with it. You can improve to a proficient singer as long as you were born with singing talent.</p>
