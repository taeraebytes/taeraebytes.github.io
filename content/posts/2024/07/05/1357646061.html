      <p>I like the lineup but no gunwooks gonna be the bastard childüòë...... yuehua fans already have an allegiance to one another (these whores also used to be some of gunwooks biggest haters..) and the members themselves have time on gunwook like the company squashing their own groups aside I CANT SUBJECT GUNWOOK TO ALIENATION!!!!!!!!!!! I do like the lineup tho

      <p>kfans love yujin-hao-ricky combo down but i dont see them involve gyuvin when talking about yuehuaz that much and he's even the one who keeps mentioning it üò≠ this is what he gets for 2binz that demonic ass duo</p>

      <p>It's kind of not that big anymore and I'm seeing more and more ppl shit on the ship and since gyuvin dropped yujin nothings keeping it alive i think yujin fans like the DUO (not ship nobody say anything weird) with hao more now

      <p>That ship still gets many postype stories though. The nb ship has gone down a bit though. Probably because zb1 isn't as popular as before.</p>

      <p>there isn‚Äôt that much material anymore so i think that‚Äôs why it feels like they‚Äôre not as big anymore. but that one fansign where they posed together in the adidas jackets fans went crazy.</p>

      <p>Nb or gc ? I think gc still get fics but most of their fans left they're not as big of a ship anymore and a lot of yujin bias in particular moved on and Gyuvin doesn't really have fans so it was the majority, nb def isn't dying they're top 10 on the zb1 instiz pretty much all the time</p>
