      <p>this is the problem with ricky's fans, they are kind of casual so they are not really helpful for him or the group, we should find out a way to market ricky to plave fans so that they can stream the songs

      <p>i mean his selling power in terms of merch has increased a lot though streaming the music just won’t happen because the type of music zb1 makes doesn’t appeal to the fans he attracts it would be perfect if the group got an opportunity to do an anime/game ost</p>

      <p>Honestly their songs just need to be taken up a notch it's easier to get streams that way and anime fans don't only listen to ops and endings 😭
