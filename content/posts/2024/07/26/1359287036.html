      <p>I think allins never liked her and zeroses started calling her out during ftp fancalls because she's just schizo and gen believes Hanbin loves her and gives her special treatment. And to allins that does not sound good and can turn into nasty rumors by antis and she just weird when it comes to the other members.</p>
