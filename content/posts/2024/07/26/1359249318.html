      <p>I do think rosins are the worst fandom by far but I always forget how bad allins are until I come accros their spaces literally so evil racist and angry towards Hao on his bday just because Hanbin wished him hbd, these people that I've argued with in the past for hating on Matthew and Yujin and one who threw gyuvin under the bus first thing first when hanbin was called out for fatphobia are now pretending theyre the best members ever like I cannot believe people have so much anger and hypocrisy all over some okay Korean man they do not even remotely know like I wonder if they feel so strongly about their own family</p>

      <p>that’s interesting cause seeing anon list it like this imo allins are still nastier by a bit, rosins tweak over big and small things by calling it mistreatment and attack members over center position but they’re mostly angry at wakeone and being overprotective schizo about hao, whereas allins are straight up racist and attacking the members unprovoked for merely interacting with hanbin. allins seem milder now cause they’ve alienated themselves from the fandom but i still think they’re worse when i come across their tweets… idk but losing morals and being racist over kpop and a korean man who doesnt know you is crazy to me</p>
