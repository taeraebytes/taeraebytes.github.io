      <p>Ok icl that one seems back handed to me and I don’t think it’s done intentionally but when you look at the pics they use the size difference is never about height it’s always about hao being skinnier and hanbin being bigger 💀</p>

      <p>I think it comes off wrong because ppl just push it to the max and it comes off as weird about it but what they usually focus on is hanbin’s chest/shoulders being broader than hao’s and yeah they’re right but they just overexaggerate it</p>
