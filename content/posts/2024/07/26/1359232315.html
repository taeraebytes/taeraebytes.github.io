      <p>omg stop I've been beating myself up over this all day... when the prices and lineup were released I had just been in la a month prior and was kinda cool off the city and everything was being managed worse than last yr not to mention the hiked prices and loss of benefits. I just didn't think it would be worth it especially since I'm planning to go to Korea at the end of the year.... I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ZB1 WOULD BE HOTEL BOUND AND LOSERS AGAIN BUT THEY ACTUALLY DECIDED TO POP OUT THIS YEAR LIKE FUCKKKKKKKK me and jang have been crying about it all day it's nobody's faults but ours that were not there ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è sorry for the paragraph I'm just going through a demonic time
