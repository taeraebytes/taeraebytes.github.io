      <p>In that sports show it was revealed that Hanbin weighs 67kg and when I went to dc, I see all of them being shocked, some wanting him to lose a little more weight, some expecting him to be very less, some saying that he should maintain it, some saying that he has a little bigger skeleton. Weight is that serious to them? I got scared reading those things.</p>
