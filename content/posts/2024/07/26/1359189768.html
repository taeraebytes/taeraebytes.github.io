      <p>sometimes I think Zb1 is cursed.. like Jiwoong fainting during their debut showcase, Gyuvin getting an eye problem right at the start of award season, always against big groups during their album releases THERE IS AN EVIL EYE</p>

      <p>There’s some nasty work going on. For debut, same day as exo and dream the week after. And zb1 actually had a chance of winning mubank but were missing broadcast points bc they missed a mubank.

Crush same tracking week as skz and aespa

Ftp we were almost in the clear bc aespa announced late May early on but then did a prerelease the same day (has paks like nobody else would be winning against them either)

I think it’s partially an over saturation of groups debuting. Esp from big companies. But is SM doing some nasty work to block zb1?? They cant be that petty right? They even suck ass with scheduling their own artists around the same time

Zb1 better not have the same tracking week as lsf i will be sooooo mad. I’m also traumatized bc of that lsf zb1 hate twt</p>
