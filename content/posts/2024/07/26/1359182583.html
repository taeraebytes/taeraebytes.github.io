      <p>Excuse me?? I am an allin but no one is calling Matthew a leech. It was some of Jiwoong fans as far as I remember. In fact, we are laughing at them because its clearly a tease and hanbin didn't  even get affected by that. Tbh, it maybe because matthew misses their old times hanging out with just the 2 of them and went to places that they used to go.  

I hope Req will show this🫶</p>

      <p>We need more big ot9 accounts who bully akgaes cause even though they're in their own spaces now they still very often manipulate truths and run fake narratives and if you heavily borderline solo a member like most of us do you probably fell for several things they spread at some point, when we get several of these accs I think we can fully ignore akgaes and we'll get more hit tweets and more casual fans</p>
