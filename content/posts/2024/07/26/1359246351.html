      <p>maybe itâ€™s bc iâ€™ve never been to a kpop concert/event so i wouldnâ€™t understand the â€˜pressureâ€™ or whatever but why does it feel like everyone who goes is shit at recording bc everyone posts the exact same thing and u would think only 1 thing happened at the event or noting things said without context when u know ppl will be confused or in bad cases could even be taken wrong like it should not be that hard to document what goes on. all this to say I NEED THE VIDEO OF THIS ASAP
