      <p>LOL ok um my bias is hao but me and my friends main goal was to see them and say hi to them all also im 5'8 for ref and 2-3 ppl were always in front of me so I wanst super close but close enough to witness them with my eyeballs

ricky came out first and omfg hes bigggg af like he def aint lying bout his height cuz I seen some '186' idols before and they my height üò≠ also hes fucking HANDSOME like his features are clear af and his tzone legit knocks u out cuz its so pretty and I screamed welcome home and he smiled gently like hes so cute when he does that

hao I went physco I told him happy birthday like 10 times and tried saying it in chinese but butchered tf outta it and hes so cute he kinda had this clueless puppy look and omfg I just love him and bitches kept shoving me atp

the other members were wearing masks and sunglasses so I cant really describe their faces so pls dkm

gunwook BIG af too and he was on my side so i screamed welcome to la gunwook! and he waved at me üò≠ im being delulu he prob wasnt waving AT me but just in my direction but his eyes are gorgggg

matthew was kinda hidden behind gunwook from where im at so i couldnt really see him üò≠ but i still scream i love u matthew

then i got shoved to the back and next thing i know i was outside staring at the back of gyuvins head because his head was peaking through the hoard of ppl and guards and hes tall af too 

I'm sad I couldnt really see taerae and yujin like I saw glimpses but still shouted like a physco i love u taerae and yujin LOOL ahh i love them and sad I cant go to kcon cuz im going to hawaii for fam trip and its why i wanted to see them at the airport so bad</p>
