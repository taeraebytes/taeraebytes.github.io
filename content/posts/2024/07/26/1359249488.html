      <p>oh if its jiwoong then yeah probably pupsamz then minamz? pupsamz were huge here back during bp and 2023 zb1 but they kinda went dry cause they barely interacted in 2024 and jiwoong keeps posting ricky on his bubble and interacts with him more so I think minamz > pupsamz now but that duo aint that popular compared to other zb1 duos</p>

      <p>hmmm I feel like minamz just did not catch on with Americans... like I felt doodoosamz being big here but minamz isn't nearly as impactful
