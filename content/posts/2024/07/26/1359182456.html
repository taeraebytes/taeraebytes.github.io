      <p>Excuse me?? I am an allin but no one is calling Matthew a leech. It was some of Jiwoong fans as far as I remember. In fact, we are laughing at them because its clearly a tease and hanbin didn't  even get affected by that. Tbh, it maybe because matthew misses their old times hanging out with just the 2 of them and went to places that they used to go.  

I hope Req will show this🫶</p>

      <p>It was a lot more than that there was a huge era were Matthew was enemy number two after Hao and no one talks about it(yes I know it's not comparable and Hao had to deal w way more etc etc) like whenever he would mention Matthew the comments in his live would get so shady, I think the cumulative point to me was hanbin making that comment about Matthew being huge when Matthew was clearly suffering from thr hate comments about this already and allins got mad AT him for receiving the comment??
