      <p>I felt bad for that Shelby person when the shippers were jumping her and thought they were overexaggerating but ngl reading her tweets it seems like she really does think hanbin is crazy about her or something</p>

      <p>It’s so funny because she’s always like omg he noticed me or remembered me and it’s like sis you have been to nearly every fancall he’s probably seen your face more than his own mama I’d be suprised if he didn’t remember you 😭</p>

      <p>she is actually way more delusional than shelby the questions from the repos she sent: “how would you express that you like me?”
“what would you do if nari is sad?”
“if one day nari suddenly disappears what would you do?”
she bought couple rings and gave one of them to hanbin. she is a c-allin currently living in the us but she went to so many fansigns in korea it’s actually crazy. her acc is nari_li3</p>
