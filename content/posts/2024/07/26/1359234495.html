      <p>Arenâ€™t only woongdeongies and rosins going for it though? I know all four made it to the final round but I donâ€™t think the other two are actively promoting it / voting like they only had to be top 30 to make it to the final</p>

      <p>I've only heard of them voting so I guess that's the case I wasn't even aware that hanbin and Ricky made it
