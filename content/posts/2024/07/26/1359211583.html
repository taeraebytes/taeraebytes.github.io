 i know it's a sensitive topic round these parts lmao but gyuvin's fr locked in with that music core mc gig... do u know when their contracts are up? bc i feel like it'd make sense of gyuvin to actually get a permanent role but also 3 members of the same group getting mc roles for different broadcasting stations all at the same time seems like something that's never been done before</p>

      <p>Music core does a heavy amount of special mcing so it doesn't really mean much they toted juyeon the most out of tbz but younghoon got the gig but it hasn't been a full year since the trio and I forget if mucore does more than 1 year for mcing. Ur right 3 is definitely too much and unrealistic I don't see why that would actually happen but wakeone was made to torture and hurt me so congrats gyuvin u can have it ✌️ don't come round my block no more tho
