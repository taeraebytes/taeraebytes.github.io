 this season has produced atleast 3-4 stars I can see them going on the known influencer route or doing more reality tv</p>

      <p>Next seasons casting rollout is gonna be soo good because the producers are gonna have sooooo many options to choose from with the new popularity and they wonâ€™t struggle with getting boys like they did in the past. My only problem is that the show has caught the eye of a bunch of TikTok influencers and insta models so I hope production doesnâ€™t just start casting a bunch of them and make the show boring after a viral season like UK did just cast ppl with good personality</p>
