      <p>I do think rosins are the worst fandom by far but I always forget how bad allins are until I come accros their spaces literally so evil racist and angry towards Hao on his bday just because Hanbin wished him hbd, these people that I've argued with in the past for hating on Matthew and Yujin and one who threw gyuvin under the bus first thing first when hanbin was called out for fatphobia are now pretending theyre the best members ever like I cannot believe people have so much anger and hypocrisy all over some okay Korean man they do not even remotely know like I wonder if they feel so strongly about their own family</p>

      <p>they havenâ€™t changed a bit from what i can tell from sometimes seeing some of the stuff they say, they just fully alienated themselves from the fandom and are acting like heâ€™s a soloist and mcd is his main job and jaehyun and sohee are his groupmates and zb1 is some side project, which is in a way is great lol but they are still nasty and racist you just donâ€™t see it</p>
