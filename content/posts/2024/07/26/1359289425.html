      <p>magazine sales ğŸ˜­  

I know that #Han Weichen# is not good at math and can't understand quadratic equations at his age, and his fans also follow him and only got 7 points in math. But can you help me see why Han Weichen's magazine, which has been sold for 7 days, can't compare to the data of #Shen Quanrui#'s magazine in the first five minutes in terms of quantity and total amount? Oh my god, is it because the fans are so good at exaggerating that they have blown the steamed food into a steamed bun?

LMAO</p>
