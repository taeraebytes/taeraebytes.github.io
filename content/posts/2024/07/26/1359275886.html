      <p>Zh Ina and the c bar getting lashed for the solo lightstick 😭 like individual fans buying it is one thing but a whole regional fanbase promoting and selling them for the group concert is weird and the c bar is catching it for making it and working with local fanbases to sell them for concerts 💀</p>
