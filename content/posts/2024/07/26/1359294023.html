      <p>the only ones who ate at the dance challenge are gunwook and hanbin. there ive said it 🙄 yujin was lacking detail, ricky and matthew put too much power into their moves to the point of it looking sloppy. the others... i dont even have to start, everybody can see why the others are non dance line members (including ricky).</p>
