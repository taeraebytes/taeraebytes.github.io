      <p>hmmmm Matthew and Ricky are leading and I think we'll see Ricky at his littest gunwooks about to be on some freak timing with the fans 🤦‍♀️ hao might get to do a little smrh special since it's his bday hmmm jiwoong will tweak gyuvin might get to handle some talking too and he's pretty good at interacting i feel like yujin is gonna be more talkative than last yr and taerae might try some english he seems better like idk what else to predict they have soooo many things to do this time around plus they'll have small fan events like making lunch boxes and lipkits 😒

      <p>When have you praised him? As far as I remember sometimes you just doesn't agree with anything hateful rosins say about Hanbin but would agree to them if he got something. That ain't praising him.</p>
