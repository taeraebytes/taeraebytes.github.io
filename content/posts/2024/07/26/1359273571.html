      <p>Idk about saebi but based on public speaking I don’t think it will be jeemin. I get the og anon doesn’t like hanbin and despite cj liking hanbin i think if he was a shit mc he wouldn’t have got the job like despite personal feelings it doesn’t mean I’ll lie and call him a bad mc because he’s not he’s a really good mc so if it were to go to an in girl they will definitely go for whoever does the best at it. Also all these girls are under wakeone anyway permanently pushing 1/2 doesn’t change anything for them because all the girls are staying</p>
