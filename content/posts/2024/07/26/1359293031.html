Like last yr I didn't have a queue number they ran out I had a ticket and everything but ur supposed to go in the morning that's where the campers usually stake out then once its open they all rush which basically pushes them to have the first few hundred numbers for queuing WHICH AGAIN STILL HAS NO GUARANTEE so theres no point it's just paranoia"
