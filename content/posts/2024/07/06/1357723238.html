      <p>Nah rosins try to claim that gp spot as much as allins do. The gag is that even if one of them gets big with the public, unless wakeone changes their music direction they still won't chart. Look at Eunwoo, the music that he released was boring so it didn't chart despite all of the country knowing who he is. 

I think you guys are thinking that promotion will give us gp success which it's a good contribution but first they need to change their music direction and give them a choreography that the GP can enjoy. TikTok payola (aka paying known influencers to do the choreo like sm did with good a guitar) + a catchy song + a good choreo will give them more success than any guesting on a youtube or tv channel.</p>

      <p>I mean now that they're reliant on the fandom and hao has the biggest one ig? Idk but yea I agree good music and marketing can do just as much heavy lifting as group promo probably even more like media play could do a lot for us
