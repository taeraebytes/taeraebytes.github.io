      <p>Itâ€™s just actually crazy to me how those Weibo melon accounts predicted this (along with alot of other stuff) like how would you even know that. But I try not to trust them too much because their other zb1 predictions are depressing.</p>

      <p>It could be but like predicting that jiwoong would reactivate his insta by the end of this year is a little too accurate to be just a guess ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Really? I feel like it wasn't lmao but we'll have to see this could all be nothing and the group disbands with the ominous reactivations all I want is for him to exit the group EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
