      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>nobody's discrediting him???? saying hanbin carries in korea is not true like im crying u even comparing hanbin to jiwoongs scandal is crazy because hanbin isn't even close to being known on that levelðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ur just feeding urself a delusion that everyone else in the group is helpless without hanbin he doesn't even have the biggest fandom in Korea anf the group is completely disregarded by the gp so please tell me what heavy lifting he's doing for these so called poor broke unknown members puhlease ðŸ˜­

      <p>Okay i know you don't like hanbin but do you even hear yourself? if he's the most known by the gp then that means he's doing the biggest job of keeping them relevant???? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ you said his solo schedules only benefit him that's not true he had fans from different fandoms interested in zb1 after doing challenges with their idols like you just sound so bitter i'm sorry lmao</p>

      <p>yall take the most "known by gp" thing as the only one known U SOUND CRAZY yujin is known and he's growing a lot faster hao is known like that doesn't mean he is the only member known by the gp like we're not stupid an almost yr long consistent exposure on public broadcast will do thatðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ do I have to walk u thru everything this so called "carry" has done nothing for the group because why would it it's a solo weekly thing even sohee and myungjae haven't grown their groups from mcing hanbin doesn't carry the group because they rely solely on their fandom the gp gave up on them a long time ago so what does any of this do for us they will always and only ever rely on their fandom which again hanbin doesn't even have the biggest one. It's kinda crazy how i quite literally never said anything negative but yall act up this bad

      <p>Also I'm a Hanbin defender but hanbin isn't known by the GP by any metrics.. anyone who knows hanbin would already be very well familiar with zb1 and probably Hao and yujin too, the gp doesn't care about zb1 let alone hanbin and ain't nothing wrong with that</p>
