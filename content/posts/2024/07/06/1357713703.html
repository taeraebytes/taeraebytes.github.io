      <p>Keplians are actually pissing me tf off they acting like they did so much for us but they brought in negative profit and they have 10 fans so doing tiktoks or collabs with them literally does nothing for us and probably why we rarely do them in the first place. With rice they got nct, aespa and exo and bnd got txt, enhyphen and seventeen etc and those groups actually have fans and can support them and can contribute to sales or streams no matter how shit their company is but all we got is keplers 10 fans and the ones yapping on twitter blaming us for wakeones doing as if we got a say like where's are unity at. They were never our sister group just spawn of a parasite sucking off our resources esp now</p>
