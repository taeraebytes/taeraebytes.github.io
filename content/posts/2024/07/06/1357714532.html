      <p>This is funny cause i had the opposite reaction üò≠ something about it brings out his flaws more (long philtrum, weird cheekbones, bad eyes)</p>

 he‚Äôs lost a lot of weight since debut and this was for yhmah so probably taken around April time but his cheeks look even less now. I mean you know it‚Äôs getting a bit too much when these almond mom k fans start noticing how thin he‚Äôs getting.</p>

      <p>They have been like that for ages tho since debut I‚Äôve seen multiple fan calls and fansign videos where they straight up tell him that he looks better skinner but they don‚Äôt always word it like that like it‚Äôs so backhanded because they will be like eat well but in the same breath say he‚Äôs gotten so handsome now he‚Äôs managing himself. Like no wonder he has the mindset he does, plus he‚Äôs already lost a shit ton of weight so this extra validation from his own fans that thinner = better isn‚Äôt going to help him.</p>
