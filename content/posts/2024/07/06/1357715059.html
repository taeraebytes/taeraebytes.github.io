      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>diff anon but what exposure they got to the gp? literally nothing they get ever compares to what hanbin gets og anon was probably exaggerating with that melon top20 but i think he should at least bring in fans and it reflects on the group's success like isnt that the whole argument allins had during sept/aug saying him getting more schedules was good for the group too if he gets promoted this much like why yall acting like it's a weird concept;g,b,g?</p>

      <p>first and foremost emka mcing is only helping hanbin himself even sohee and myungjae are only getting exposure for themselves it's part of the reason why sohees  image changed and myungjae remains the only member of bnd anybody knows so that's not helping us and outside of that there's not much else like sorry I've said it ALWAYS and I'll say it again solo promo does almost nothing for a group ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like we knew that alr
