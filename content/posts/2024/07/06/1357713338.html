      <p>this is the problem with ricky's fans, they are kind of casual so they are not really helpful for him or the group, we should find out a way to market ricky to plave fans so that they can stream the songs

      <p>i mean his selling power in terms of merch has increased a lot though streaming the music just wonâ€™t happen because the type of music zb1 makes doesnâ€™t appeal to the fans he attracts it would be perfect if the group got an opportunity to do an anime/game ost</p>

      <p>Honestly their songs just need to be taken up a notch it's easier to get streams that way and anime fans don't only listen to ops and endings ðŸ˜­

      <p>I feel like a korean yura yura typa song would do well, it got anime vibes especially the first trailer I thought I was watching an anime opening and probably because its Lapone? / Sony so the quality was just so much better + kzeroses were malding because of how good yura yura was but it was a Japanese song ðŸ˜­ PLEASE SWING SAVE USSSSS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
