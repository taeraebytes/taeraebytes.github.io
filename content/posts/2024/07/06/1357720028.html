      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>What about the exposure the other members have been getting ? Or do you realise that’s not exactly how that works</p>

      <p>diff anon but what exposure they got to the gp? literally nothing they get ever compares to what hanbin gets og anon was probably exaggerating with that melon top20 but i think he should at least bring in fans and it reflects on the group's success like isnt that the whole argument allins had during sept/aug saying him getting more schedules was good for the group too if he gets promoted this much like why yall acting like it's a weird concept;g,b,g?</p>

      <p>first and foremost emka mcing is only helping hanbin himself even sohee and myungjae are only getting exposure for themselves it's part of the reason why sohees  image changed and myungjae remains the only member of bnd anybody knows so that's not helping us and outside of that there's not much else like sorry I've said it ALWAYS and I'll say it again solo promo does almost nothing for a group 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like we knew that alr

      <p>The only way to bring in more fans for the group is to actually promote them as a group, send them to shows as a group, say it’s the group or nothing. Like that’s why it’s ultimately working for bnd and riize because aside from their MCs in both groups they do everything as a group I don’t think there is any other solo schedules and for a group that isn’t even a year old zb1 has an insane amount of solo and unit work</p>

      <p>This whole argument is useless cause it could do some heavy lifting for the group if he was actually known by the GP but he simply isn't, like, at all..and that's not his fault either were not getting the gp hype or expanding the fandom because of wakeone shitty promo tactics</p>

      <p>Why are people dumping everything on Hanbin as if there's not other members who are getting promotions too? Yujin is on Inkigayo which it's a public channel with Leeseo who is bigger than Sohee and Myungjae and he has been getting two magazine covers in less than 1 month, then we have Ricky and Zhang Hao who has been getting work in both china and Korea and yet the anons here don't pin the same pressure on them.</p>

      <p>Well yea but I think they're trynna say the China gigs would translate into smth for Korea 😭? Idk but I'm sorry people placed this crazy incorrect importance on hanbin so he'll always get responsibility even tho nothing is his fault it's the fans🤷‍♀️ you can't have ur cake and eat it
