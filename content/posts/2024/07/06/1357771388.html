      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>What about the exposure the other members have been getting ? Or do you realise that’s not exactly how that works</p>

      <p>diff anon but what exposure they got to the gp? literally nothing they get ever compares to what hanbin gets og anon was probably exaggerating with that melon top20 but i think he should at least bring in fans and it reflects on the group's success like isnt that the whole argument allins had during sept/aug saying him getting more schedules was good for the group too if he gets promoted this much like why yall acting like it's a weird concept;g,b,g?</p>

      <p>first and foremost emka mcing is only helping hanbin himself even sohee and myungjae are only getting exposure for themselves it's part of the reason why sohees  image changed and myungjae remains the only member of bnd anybody knows so that's not helping us and outside of that there's not much else like sorry I've said it ALWAYS and I'll say it again solo promo does almost nothing for a group 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 like we knew that alr

      <p>The only way to bring in more fans for the group is to actually promote them as a group, send them to shows as a group, say it’s the group or nothing. Like that’s why it’s ultimately working for bnd and riize because aside from their MCs in both groups they do everything as a group I don’t think there is any other solo schedules and for a group that isn’t even a year old zb1 has an insane amount of solo and unit work</p>

      <p>The korean fans always talk about wanting a group live. I think that would do good too. I have stanned many kpop idols but I never spend time watching their bbl or ig lives like I do with hanbin. I think the members in general are so good with the fans in live content.</p>

      <p>I love solo lives but whenever we get any pair or group lives even very professional and monitored ones like the Hao Ricky jiwoong hanbin one I prefer it sm cause members can actually bounce off of eo like no matter what you need that group dynamic</p>

      <p>it also just sucks because we don't have much time with the group left and there's barely anything to look back on group wise that's so sad like imagine wanting to reminisce the group AND ALL U HAVE IS SOLO LIVES WHERE THE MEMBERS INTERACT W THE CHAT HALF THE TIME🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

      <p>Also don't kill me but some of those duos that wakeone likes to push for lives and self produced content don't even have that much chemistry or fun in them. Like Luckyz is boring, Woonghao are awkward as hell no matter how much time has passed, yujin x gyuvin is boring as hell too.</p>

      <p>I know you like to defend Yujin but he is kinda boring by himself so you need someone that he's friends with to get the fun out of him, that's why they need to pair him with people like Gunwook, he's even more funnier with Matthew than he is with Hao/Gyuvin/Jiwoong.

Jiwoong should stay away from Yujin bc their content is bad and they need to stop trying it with Woonghao. Maybe they can get him with Taerae bc at least with him he acts kinda normal.

For hao he's fine with his little men (hao2binz) and I also enjoy haorae. Him and matty sometimes it's a hit or a miss and I hope people here don't kill me but hariboz don't even have that sauce anymore, like they were fun at the start but now those two barely know each other.

For Hanbin, 2binz it's tired already. Cheonanz is boring as hell. Imo the funnest moments with him is when he's with Hao or Gunwook.

Gunwook can be with anyone except jiwoong like they don't bring anything to the table.

Taerae it's fine with anyone but not Gyuvin bc he starts tweaking. Same for cheonanz, they are boring together. 

Gyuvin needs to let go of Yujin. And you already know my opinion about him and Taerae. He should be paired with Gunwook or Ricky imo.

Matthew should be paired with Gunwook or Taerae. I like his interactions with Yujin too.

Ricky is fun when he's with Gyuvin, Gunwook and also Matthew. I like how he treats Yujin too and they are not an usual pair.</p>

      <p>well yea I like him😭😭 but it's true he's not versatile enough to be interesting with everyone I prefer him only with the younger members tbh 

Jiwoong just stay away from everyone 

hariboz never had sauce sis... but those are fun I used to like gunhao a lot but idk if the relationship prevails now that they're separate 

It's already slim pickings but yea 

Exactly no jiwoong thanks 

Ugh exactly sis gyurae is terrible 

Gyuvin already let go of yujin tbh and yea he's best with riwook idc

Matthews pretty versatile too I kinda like him w Ricky more now even tho we don't see a lot 

People are really coming to like yujin and Ricky a lot and they seem fun to me so just like yujin Ricky's best w the younger members and matty
