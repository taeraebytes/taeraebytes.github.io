      <p>Hanbin has said before that the best compliments that he could get were related to him loosing weight so yeah he's pretty much disordered which I kinda understand why, when people lose tons of weight and the skinny privilege starts hitting it makes them feel pretty good bc you keep receiving compliments and better treatment from people. So add that to the fact that he's on an industry on where the cameras are on him all the time and you are subject to the public opinion, on an industry on where visuals matter a lot...</p>

      <p>I am a bbhl and Baekhyun has weight problems too. He recently said he lost like 6 kgs that should mean he is around 56 kg rn (he mentioned his weight being 62 before his tour), and the kfans were all worried about him losing weight but he said"you all say that but enjoy it when I look good after losing weight"..... That is so true. People are so hypocritic, they be asking them to eat well and stop losing weight but then go around saying they look good after they lose some weight. Hao looks like he lost a lot of weight too during that iland2 finale and you are all out there saying it is his best look, ofc they might want that praise again.</p>
