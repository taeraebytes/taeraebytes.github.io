      <p>Queef and anons, what do yall want for this comeback? Music and concept wise. I personally like the season theme they got going on. They have done summer, spring and winter. So fall is left, and it reminds me of the very first teaser they released with haobin. It was actually intriguing but well, they expanded nothing on that. Would love it if they developed the video game concept more like you could do so much with it. As for music, hoping its cohesive like yits and the songs to be on their range like run run cover. I actually want it to be a full length album this time.</p>
