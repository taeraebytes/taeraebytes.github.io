      <p>With the amount of exposure hanbin has gotten in june alone right after their promotions ended i'm expecting them to crack melon top20 at least with their next comeback. They better.</p>

      <p>diff anon but what exposure they got to the gp? literally nothing they get ever compares to what hanbin gets og anon was probably exaggerating with that melon top20 but i think he should at least bring in fans and it reflects on the group's success like isnt that the whole argument allins had during sept/aug saying him getting more schedules was good for the group too if he gets promoted this much like why yall acting like it's a weird concept;g,b,g?</p>

      <p>first and foremost emka mcing is only helping hanbin himself even sohee and myungjae are only getting exposure for themselves it's part of the reason why sohees  image changed and myungjae remains the only member of bnd anybody knows so that's not helping us and outside of that there's not much else like sorry I've said it ALWAYS and I'll say it again solo promo does almost nothing for a group ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like we knew that alr

      <p>The only way to bring in more fans for the group is to actually promote them as a group, send them to shows as a group, say itâ€™s the group or nothing. Like thatâ€™s why itâ€™s ultimately working for bnd and riize because aside from their MCs in both groups they do everything as a group I donâ€™t think there is any other solo schedules and for a group that isnâ€™t even a year old zb1 has an insane amount of solo and unit work</p>

      <p>This whole argument is useless cause it could do some heavy lifting for the group if he was actually known by the GP but he simply isn't, like, at all..and that's not his fault either were not getting the gp hype or expanding the fandom because of wakeone shitty promo tactics</p>

      <p>Why are people dumping everything on Hanbin as if there's not other members who are getting promotions too? Yujin is on Inkigayo which it's a public channel with Leeseo who is bigger than Sohee and Myungjae and he has been getting two magazine covers in less than 1 month, then we have Ricky and Zhang Hao who has been getting work in both china and Korea and yet the anons here don't pin the same pressure on them.</p>

      <p>well tbh we tried but then you guys always discredit it

Hao - Only popular in China and Japan and his fandom can only bulk buy so he's useless
Yujin - Pushed but he's quiet and has no personality so he's useless
Matthew - Short so he's useless
Taerae - Can sing but lacks the idol visual and persona so he's useless
Ricky - Can only go viral, only attracting anime, game nerds and casual fans so he's useless
Gunwook - Can sing, dance, rap but he's not Hanbin so he's useless
Gyuvin - Can't sing can't dance so he's useless
Jiwoong - Useless

Like we're trying to help hanbin out and split the load, hariboz carry in china, yujin carry in visuals and reaching younger demographic, hao carry in sales, ricky carry in viralism/ reaching casuals, gunwook carries as the all rounder, matthew carries as the short main character guy with power buffs, gyuvin carries as the useless child that we can never hate and love dearly because he brings the fam together, taerae carries in vocals and ballads, jiwoong carries in- 

but noooooo it's all gotta be hanbin, only hanbin is capable of carrying and give results, only hanbin fans can bulk buy because majority of hao fans are chinese and we don't care about chinese ppl buying albums because they're FRAUDS, only hanbin can mc and reach kgp yet yujins been going viral for his visuals but nahh he's boring and has no personality the gp will forget about him, only hanbin can go viral on kforums and thank god because we need kgp to know about us so bad so idc if they only know hanbin as the handsome mc but when ricky did the same thing its suddenly ehh so what they only know him as the fashion 2d looking guy etc etc. I could go on and on but allins brought this upon themselves always discrediting the members ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Different anon and am I being sensitive because how is this anon gonna say everybody useless when it's literally just Jiwoong and wakone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

We were able to reach so many sales goals, break records because of Hao's fandom buying power lbfr,  
Yujin is getting more and more recognition everyday and skills are constantly improving, 
Matthew is talented and gives us fun cringe content we desperately need in this dooms day type fandom, 
Taerae blessing us with his vocals and was a part of a popular netflex kdrama reaching drama lovers, 
Ppl discredit Rickys viralism because its was only american tiktokers but now he goes viral in Japan and Korea and is giving us more exposure to normies and non kpop fans, 
Gunwook is literally the reason why were able to try out so many concepts because of his ace capabilities able to fill in any roles, 
Gyuvin cant sing and dance but hes our happy pill if not our members would lowkey be depressed all the time and he's improving his skills, 
Even Hanbin is busting his ass off every week to mc despite his busy schedule (Yujin too) and its paying off because he just went viral on pann and I'll admit he's our second ace.

Every member is doing incredibly well and being extremely useful in their retrospective categories ESPECIALLY because were trying to climb out of the shitters Jiwoong caused. Anon doesn't understand how mentally depressing it must be for the members to have it all and then suddenly dropped by the gp over one scandal they had no involvement in yet look, sales still up, Yujin getting more popular day by day, multiple member viralism internationally AND domestically, OST in a popular kdrama all AFTER Jiwoongs scandal.
