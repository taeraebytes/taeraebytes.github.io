      <p>Eh checked the video and it's really not a real issue like no desi person will careðŸ˜­I'm saying this as a desi person you can tell most of the quotes are rosins who are absolutely not south Asians</p>

      <p>Yeah! honestly I'm more out off by the quotes clearly instrumentalising desi people than this very small gesture, it's kinda dehumanising</p>

      <p>Same but I know south Asians in the west sometimes feel differently I don't think any desis person here at least would even remotely care (Pakistani) zb1 barely have desi fans too so most of those quotes are definitely white or sea</p>
