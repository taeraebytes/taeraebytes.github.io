      <p>Hanbin lost the most tbh. He was crazy popular in korea once. I am a predebut allin and his kfandom has been decreasing in size with time. it was always concerning for me. And I really hate those solo iallins who think he is doing well in korea and set him up against rosins. Like no, I don't think they were there during bp. I remember all tweets getting thousands of likes in seconds and minutes when he went to visit his ads. Now he rarely gets 1k likes. And those viral tweets don't do him any good. I'm not bragging about one 10k likes tweet when he used to get multiple ones easily before. And for intl side, his biggest account shbcloud is no longer active, the other accounts like namubin are all blocked by haobinists.</p>

He's still the second most popular and he has improved so much, I feel like he can start expanding his fanbase and if zb1 gets more popular lock in more loyal fans if he's willing to take some risks</p>
