      <p>tbh i think everyone lost lots of fans everywhere esp in korea but members who had bp fandoms built more in places that comparatively aren't seeing as drastic fan loss (cn, japan) may have felt it a bit less?  still this is normal though survival show groups usually peak on debut night & keep going down from there we should just enjoy the time we have left</p>
