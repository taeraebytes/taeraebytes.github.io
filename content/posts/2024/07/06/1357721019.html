      <p>I think the funniest example of this was Hanbins TL accounts not translating haos bday surprise but shouting out trsr passing by and wishing him happy bday broðŸ˜­like even if you dislike Hao that was very sweet and it's admirable how much they've preserved their relationship through everything, 

even if I feel iffy about gyuvin and gyubrik I will always be grateful for gyuvin for supporting Ricky sm and being a genuine friend to him I could never be an akgae lol like I will always love a little anyone who loves my bias</p>
