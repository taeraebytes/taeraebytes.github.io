      <p>nobody's discrediting him???? saying hanbin carries in korea is not true like im crying u even comparing hanbin to jiwoongs scandal is crazy because hanbin isn't even close to being known on that levelðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ur just feeding urself a delusion that everyone else in the group is helpless without hanbin he doesn't even have the biggest fandom in Korea anf the group is completely disregarded by the gp so please tell me what heavy lifting he's doing for these so called poor broke unknown members puhlease ðŸ˜­
