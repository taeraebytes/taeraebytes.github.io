      <p>I think the funniest example of this was Hanbins TL accounts not translating haos bday surprise but shouting out trsr passing by and wishing him happy bday broüò≠like even if you dislike Hao that was very sweet and it's admirable how much they've preserved their relationship through everything, 

even if I feel iffy about gyuvin and gyubrik I will always be grateful for gyuvin for supporting Ricky sm and being a genuine friend to him I could never be an akgae lol like I will always love a little anyone who loves my bias</p>

      <p>Riyangis who still like Gyuvin unitelike same I'm really not a fan of some of the shit he did but clearly he really does love Ricky even if he hasn't always respected him and Ricky does too, he supports him and is clearly a genuine friend to him I could never hate</p>
