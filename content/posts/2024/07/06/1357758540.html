      <p>I think the funniest example of this was Hanbins TL accounts not translating haos bday surprise but shouting out trsr passing by and wishing him happy bday broüò≠like even if you dislike Hao that was very sweet and it's admirable how much they've preserved their relationship through everything, 

even if I feel iffy about gyuvin and gyubrik I will always be grateful for gyuvin for supporting Ricky sm and being a genuine friend to him I could never be an akgae lol like I will always love a little anyone who loves my bias</p>

      <p>Riyangis who still like Gyuvin unitelike same I'm really not a fan of some of the shit he did but clearly he really does love Ricky even if he hasn't always respected him and Ricky does too, he supports him and is clearly a genuine friend to him I could never hate</p>

      <p>Girl let's be real half of rosins and allins don't even like them they just like the competition they have within each other and the brag rights that those two can give them. So yeah they won't be like omg but Hao loves Hanbin so I will stop hating on him bc they don't care about him on the first place.</p>

      <p>There's some truth to that because a lot of the time the hate outweighs the love for their bias it's crazy like even I would slightly hate jiwoong less if gunwook was super close to him or smth (THANK GOD HES NOTüòÇüôè)

      <p>Bruh rosins were harassing a girl who spotted haobin eating outside because they thought she was paid by wakeone she was dumbfounded cause she's not a fan at all, they're on another level like they really don't want to accept they're close remember the meltdown after Hao said Hanbin was his WeChat pfp I have NEVER in all my years of kpop seen this and I was a nctzen before like that's crazy</p>
