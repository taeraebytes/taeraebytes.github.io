      <p>I'm not blind.. and them being genuine wouldn't even change anything because it's about closeness and both of them have other members they're closer to their friendships pretty limited anyways

      <p>ur young but when you get a little older time wouldn’t really matter in friendships i have friends i’ve known since middle school now I graduated college and we cant keep a conversation bcs we changed a lot as ppl and im more comfortable with my other friends that i made in college so its normal really that the friends you have known the longest aren’t the closest to you</p>

      <p>I know you can outgrow people but Matthew and hanbin have only known each other for like 2-3 years so it's not rlly like the whole childhood friend thing versus growing into a new person it's like Matthew and hanbin just know each other better compared to the others but I think hanbin has different relationships with all 3 anyways
