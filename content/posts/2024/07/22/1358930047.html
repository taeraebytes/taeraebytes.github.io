      <p>On the topic of zb1 content yes I do wish they had more ot9 content ofc because they're funny and I want to see more of them but I think the whole "lack of content" thing is just a teensy bit overblown they have quite a bit of content spread around different places for a group that's been around for 1 year and comparison to wanna one is also false equivalence because things ran VERY differently back then those seperately sponsored variety shows like back to zerobase was their only source of content and these several different youtube contents did not exist and most groups operate with variety shows in similar manner now but yes zbtv and zbfolder could be way better and I wish they brought in camp zb1 s2

that being said I have this non zerose friend who has just been watching all of their content from different places and been loving it because she finds them entertaining and she told me there's actually so much content for her to get through so ya trust me guys ppl who want get into them will get into them no matter what</p>
