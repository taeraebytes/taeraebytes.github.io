      <p>half the group is confirmed to have renewed already even tho Kevin has had the most issues with ist I think he'll still renew they're just pushing for better terms I don't see any of them leaving the group but maybe it's possible they leave the company since they're all starting to venture into their own stuff but I have a feeling they'll most likely just renew and continue as 11

      <p>If we are talking about having a future secured I can see younghoon, juyeon and hyunjae leaving... Even sunwoo. But I don't see why would Kevin leave even if he's pissed at IST when he knows that there's no much opportunities for him out there</p>

      <p>younghoon has his stale dramas hyunjae kinda has no real prospects juyeon would be fine but kevin has probably been treated the worst by the company and they spite him a lot he has no prospects but id understand if he left
