      <p>fr though xhs people are everywhere like it's really the app to go if you want to see random sightings of the members and a lot of the times it's like actually random people that meet them not zerosesğŸ˜­ i definitely prefer it to weibo</p>

      <p>me too i prefer it to weibo I barely go on there I feel like the only thing better about it is it's like twitter you don't need to post smth to write what u want so it's easier to see rumors and scandal but omgggg yes I'll see a crazy sighting and then u click their page they're a normal person

      <p>haos on tea and I feel like for someone who doesn't understand or read Chinese xhs is just easier to navigate and someone mentioned her before once I think ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­
