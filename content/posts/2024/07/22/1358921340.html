      <p>I'm not blind.. and them being genuine wouldn't even change anything because it's about closeness and both of them have other members they're closer to their friendships pretty limited anyways

      <p>ur young but when you get a little older time wouldn’t really matter in friendships i have friends i’ve known since middle school now I graduated college and we cant keep a conversation bcs we changed a lot as ppl and im more comfortable with my other friends that i made in college so its normal really that the friends you have known the longest aren’t the closest to you</p>

      <p>I know you can outgrow people but Matthew and hanbin have only known each other for like 2-3 years so it's not rlly like the whole childhood friend thing versus growing into a new person it's like Matthew and hanbin just know each other better compared to the others but I think hanbin has different relationships with all 3 anyways

      <p>Oh it wasn't 2-3 years recently I calculated matthews trainee periods for funsies and matthew has said he was at hybe before he went to cube and then mnh he has also said he was in the line up of &audition which happened in mid 2022 so i assumed he was still in there till early 2022 or maybe late 2021 and he was already with mnh in aug 2022 because that's when bp auditions happened so between hybe and mnh his time in cube would've been only for a few months so ya hanbin did know matthew for a few months more than he knew the rest and def had a close enough relationship to write a letter to him on leaving (altho I have this striking feeling hanbin is one of those ppl that has a big heart and considers everyone close friends but anyways) but it's not 2 3 years like a lot of ppl think just a fun tidbit</p>
