      <p>i will explain so in the Premier League which is in England there's what we call the "Big Six": Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, and Liverpool. 

mancity have won the league in the last 6 year, but Manchester United used to be much more successful and holds the record for the most league titles with 20 but their last was in 2012 they are shit now and they haven't won anything significant in yearsss they suck so bad tbh

In La Liga, which is in Spain, there are two major teams: Real Madrid and Barcelona. They literally arch enemies they hate each other and the rivalry has been going on for ages cristiano ronaldo used to play for Real Madrid while Messi played for Barcelona their match is called a El ClÃ¡sico and where i live we called it the earth clÃ¡sico bcs the whole earth will be watching that match ðŸ˜­(except you guys in the us maybe) 

the Champions League is competition where the best teams from different countries in europe compete every year and its pretty big deal and real madrid has the most titles with 15 for comparison AC Milan has 7, Barcelona has 5, and Liverpool has 6, while manchester united has 3 real madrid dominates football nowadays which is honestly fucking irritating 

a lot of their fans especially the young ones come off to me as glory hunters bcs these ppl have never struggled a day in their life supporting a club that quite literally wins  everything is so easy</p>
