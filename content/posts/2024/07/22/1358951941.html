      <p>I'm not blind.. and them being genuine wouldn't even change anything because it's about closeness and both of them have other members they're closer to their friendships pretty limited anyways

      <p>ur young but when you get a little older time wouldnâ€™t really matter in friendships i have friends iâ€™ve known since middle school now I graduated college and we cant keep a conversation bcs we changed a lot as ppl and im more comfortable with my other friends that i made in college so its normal really that the friends you have known the longest arenâ€™t the closest to you</p>

      <p>I know you can outgrow people but Matthew and hanbin have only known each other for like 2-3 years so it's not rlly like the whole childhood friend thing versus growing into a new person it's like Matthew and hanbin just know each other better compared to the others but I think hanbin has different relationships with all 3 anyways

      <p>Oh it wasn't 2-3 years recently I calculated matthews trainee periods for funsies and matthew has said he was at hybe before he went to cube and then mnh he has also said he was in the line up of &audition which happened in mid 2022 so i assumed he was still in there till early 2022 or maybe late 2021 and he was already with mnh in aug 2022 because that's when bp auditions happened so between hybe and mnh his time in cube would've been only for a few months so ya hanbin did know matthew for a few months more than he knew the rest and def had a close enough relationship to write a letter to him on leaving (altho I have this striking feeling hanbin is one of those ppl that has a big heart and considers everyone close friends but anyways) but it's not 2 3 years like a lot of ppl think just a fun tidbit</p>

      <p>wait so, i guess this is more to anon bc idt you'd know requeef haha, when did hanbin leave cube bc for some reason i imagined that he left in late 2021 or so since mid 2022 (a confirmed time in which mattbin were in different companies and i'm p sure hanbin left cube before matthew since they've mentioned that hanbin wrote him a letter before he left) is so close to bp. granted, he joined studio glide bc of former cube staff so he probably didn't have a whole audition process and therefore it'd be less time consuming than just normally getting into a company but idk i just assumed he was in studio glide longer than only a few months before bp ðŸ˜­ but also wow they were friends for such a short amount of time at the start of bp then that's crazy</p>

      <p>Hanbin left cube yes but that doesn't mean they didn't contact eo duringthose time. I think they already said it before that hanbin goes to seoul to have bonding with matthew at the same time taking classes with bada and sometime he brought matthew to cheonan knowing that matt has a fav drink in Hanbin's mom's caffe. And the reason why matthew consider to join bp is because hanbin ask him. Prev anon might be right in some cases about longer friends but hanbin and matthew situation, they are living together in same dorm, seeing eo 24/7, eating together a lot because they are in the same group. You are talking about friends who aren't contacting eo for longer time and its far different with mattbin. And the fact that they are also join classes in just jerk before explains a lot. And in Hanbin's personality, he is not the kind of friend who can be distant easily. He is approachable, friendly and dependable this is why matthew still depending on him. They are vocal how they see eo as a family. They don't want to be ship romantically, i can feel it because they know eo more than the other member</p>
