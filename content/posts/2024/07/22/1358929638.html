      <p>catching up on ccs and got to ppl talking about wanting to see zb1 do fun content and LMAO i actually don't think zb1 can do all that much bc of the state of their fanbase like i was watching the insomnia zero going seventeen episodes recently and the members were going innnnnnnnn which is partly bc they've known each other for so long but like while i was watching i was thinking that if zb1 did anything close to that every single subfandom would order a truck outside wakeone a minute after upload like it's no wonder everything is boring and scripted down</p>
