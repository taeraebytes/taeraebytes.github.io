      <p>Actually the ceo thing makes me think that Ricky has kinda been out of the dynamics unless we count the recent gyubrik moments as yh pr but it started a lot later than jjangyuz and luckyz boom, it's making me think that maybe Ricky is leaving yh</p>

      <p>yea I was surprised like maybe he's just unmoved or he was left out of the loop but yuehuas probably only started to value him now cuz he was previously the one they never acknowledged

      <p>I mean itâ€™s really not that surprising, even in bp yh never acknowledged him yet acknowledged all their other trainees  they quite literally never planned for him to make the group or be successful</p>

      <p>idr have an opinion on that it's just a fact that Ricky was ignored by yuehua in the beginning so take it how you will
