      <p>gunwooks an oldhead 😭💔 the million dollar baby tiktok did so well tho even though it's an old sound he has the platform he just needs the plan. I have a new idea for him now tho and its even more unrealistic than mamushi he needs to do a tiktok cover of latrices new viral choreo i already send him hella messages on plus chat LIKE PLEEEEEK

      <p>Wait is this not usually done ? 😭 at least in the allin spaces I know he ask pretty often is there anything we’d like to see challenge or content wise or whenever there is a trending tiktok dance or one that we think would suit him either the k side (for k sounds) or the I side like spam on his plus chat and in the messages. Not for like days maybe like a day but it increases the chance that he sees it if it’s more organised and people only have to use like 2/3 of their messages when he’s active which I mean he’s active everyday multiple times a day so it’s not too hard either and you don’t feel like your waisting messages</p>
