      <p>me too i prefer it to weibo I barely go on there I feel like the only thing better about it is it's like twitter you don't need to post smth to write what u want so it's easier to see rumors and scandal but omgggg yes I'll see a crazy sighting and then u click their page they're a normal person

      <p>isnt weibo kinda regulated? like if u upload a pic and use their hashtag and it shows up in their super topic the admins of their super topic can choose whether or not to publicize it so more controversial posts or breaching artist privact posts will not show up or something</p>
