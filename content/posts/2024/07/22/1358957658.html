thoughts on this?
I think "2 of them will go solo" = hao & ricky
"one of them will leave the company in the future" = gyuvin?
"someone will redebut in a group after the contract is over" = yujin? it's unclear if they're talking abt yuehua or wk1 but either way yujin is the one to most likely cuz of his age n popularity
"one of them will get A LOT of opportunities the moment the contract is over. it will be a kick in the right direction for them, a lot of support n new opportunities, very good things will happen n their career will really take off, finally" = can be hao but i 've a feeling it's ricky bc of the way it's worded
"one of them will try a diff path/try new stuff. for that specific person who will leave yuehua, they may try establishing a good career for themselves under there but it wont work out of them"  = i've a hard time believing yujin will flop in any circumstance so it must be gyuvin

sooo hao ricky won't debut in yuehua. they will go to china solo and will be successful. gyuvin and yujin will debut tgt and then some time after that gyuvin will leave OR gyuvin will leave even before yuehuaz debut to pursue something else but flops and yujin will debut in group as a center. kinda feel bad for my homie gyuvin if that's the case lol</p>

      <p>Oh a yuehuaz reading ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’

ok hao i can see going solo BUT RICKY ðŸ˜­? 
yea people have kind of placed that future on gyuvin during our post disbandment discussions the only way i see it going is if he left the idol world and tried acting 
But yea def yujin is locked in to redebut 
Lowkey same i have a feeling it's Ricky rather than hao since hao gets a bunch already and Ricky not at all 
but yea that's sounds like gyuvin
