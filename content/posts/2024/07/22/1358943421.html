      <p>another anon and I'm always curious what you mean by haircut? like his style now but just shorter or do u have a specific haircut u like on him? hes not my bias but I think today is my ideal hair on him he looks best when his forehead is exposed or half exposed like today and I cant imagine him with teh typical korean mushroom cut üò≠</p>

      <p>he has hella dead ends and I don't rlly like the way how his face gets framed sometimes he looks the best when the hairs out of his face I don't have a specific type in mind we just need something done it's not bad but like the way his hair used to be cut and styled around August last yr was too teaaa

      <p>I think Ricky needs short hair because his face is very long and his features masculine so it will just compliment his face better, longer hair just make his face seem longer</p>

      <p>yea his face looks longer now I feel like his features just don't pop as much if there's too much hair framing his face he has the kind of face that's best without anything obstructing it
