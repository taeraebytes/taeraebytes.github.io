      <p>surprisingly.. I want gunwook team devil like ugh I know the whole world has given him trauma for his image but devil is sooo much more fun than angel but I wouldn't be opposed to Angel 

Team Angel - hanbin yujin taerae gyuvin Matthew 
Team devil - hao gunwook Ricky jiwoong 

I gotta be realistic and put the hate aside this is just what I see I feel like maybe yujin could be a devil too
