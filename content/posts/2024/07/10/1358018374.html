      <p>"cafes start a week or five days before the actual date too"

Actually the Cafes open the bday Cafes at the begining of the month. Hao is not the only Idol who is going to have Bday Cafes around Seoul, Kfans kinda have to fight for these spots with each other. The earlier you reserve or start the Bday Cafe for your Idol, the better your chances are of getting that Cafe to agree with you</p>
