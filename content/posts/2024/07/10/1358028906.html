      <p>he had 44 cafes in korea 84 cafes in general but these are the ones op could find on twitter/weibo by posts made by visitors so it’s not the exact number. idk why a c-allin of all people was the only one who made this summary though

      <p>Nobody's fandom is touching in bloom era regardless of an increase because they all decreased a crazy amt so it's more like they're trying to catch up

      <p>I can see members solo fandom increasing but ot9 decreasing. Like at the beginning everyone liked every members post so say 20k avg fanbase per member x9 that's 180k likes give and take some akgaes and solos so 130k makes sense.

But with so many subfandoms fighting cause wakeone lacks group content and just horrible at managing the group and the fact that we're a temp group ot9s are just focused on their biased now. And guys that's why solo igs are a BAD thing 😭 let's pray this anniversary thing unites the fandom pleaseeee 🙏</p>

      <p>Honestly it would take a lot like a lotttt to even get a fraction of what we had before in terms of group effort but it's also that zb1 are pretty inactive on twitter so Engagements are automatically lower and they've been shadowbanned a couple times I think the anniversary stuff would def help out in unification tho also the engagements for the anniversary post seem better already

      <p>I think members gained more international fans but lost kfans. Not just the jiwoong issue but ever since the fuck up with their first fancon, crush concept (we might like it but they didn't fuck with it), no good group content and japan fancon being so much better etc then jiwoongs scandal and then ftp was focused on the western market which again just left kfans hanging so I'm surprised there's still a good chunk of kfans left but kgp or k casual def left</p>

      <p>Def and it's crazy cause I don't even know where these intl fans come from and why they randomly came in in 2024 very much down for it especially since they're mostly ot9 but it's very random</p>

      <p>i feel like crush turned quite a few away tho? like yeah it wasn't liked on the k side but intl fans didn't seem to be rocking with it either like the teaser was mocked and all anyone could focus on was the chorus while the rest of the song got ignored. i don't really recall them gaining fans from it but if they did then that's good bc it really felt like the end of times back then to me lmao</p>

      <p>It turned away that annoying token gg type of fan but it's classic boy group music so it attracted the kind of fans that would stick around and work and in turn they attracted more people. Like crush out viewed in bloom in days

      <p>In crush our voting power increased massively compared to debut, its hard to notice like u said zb1 had some weird audience during bp/in bloom because of the 5th gen bg expectations.</p>
