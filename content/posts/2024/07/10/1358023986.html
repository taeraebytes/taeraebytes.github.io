      <p>he had 44 cafes in korea 84 cafes in general but these are the ones op could find on twitter/weibo by posts made by visitors so it’s not the exact number. idk why a c-allin of all people was the only one who made this summary though

      <p>Nobody's fandom is touching in bloom era regardless of an increase because they all decreased a crazy amt so it's more like they're trying to catch up

      <p>I can see members solo fandom increasing but ot9 decreasing. Like at the beginning everyone liked every members post so say 20k avg fanbase per member x9 that's 180k likes give and take some akgaes and solos so 130k makes sense.

But with so many subfandoms fighting cause wakeone lacks group content and just horrible at managing the group and the fact that we're a temp group ot9s are just focused on their biased now. And guys that's why solo igs are a BAD thing 😭 let's pray this anniversary thing unites the fandom pleaseeee 🙏</p>

      <p>Honestly it would take a lot like a lotttt to even get a fraction of what we had before in terms of group effort but it's also that zb1 are pretty inactive on twitter so Engagements are automatically lower and they've been shadowbanned a couple times I think the anniversary stuff would def help out in unification tho also the engagements for the anniversary post seem better already

      <p>I think members gained more international fans but lost kfans. Not just the jiwoong issue but ever since the fuck up with their first fancon, crush concept (we might like it but they didn't fuck with it), no good group content and japan fancon being so much better etc then jiwoongs scandal and then ftp was focused on the western market which again just left kfans hanging so I'm surprised there's still a good chunk of kfans left but kgp or k casual def left</p>
