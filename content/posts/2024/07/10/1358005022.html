      <p>haorae is fun because taerae is the only member who doesn't treat hao like god personified but at the same time hao loves teasing and being affectionate towards taerae when it's usually everyone doing that towards hao idk they're so fun together I want a haorae live</p>

      <p>There's a difference between respecting someone and treating them like Gods, you could say Matthew and Gyuvin God-ify Hanbin but that's all, everyone rightfully RESPECTS Hao (expect Jiwoong ðŸ‘€) but that isn't worship..a lot of y'all know nothing about being respected and stanning without worshipping and it shows</p>

      <p>yea honestly hanbin seems like the only one that gets that and it's only from gyuvin and matty gyuvin does the same to hao now but it's new he didn't do that before they all respect hao but that's still their friend I don't think anyone goes overboard with it ðŸ˜­

      <p>it just seems like he can be disconnected from their friendship at times and definitely not as much as gyuvin and I don't think he does anymore but it felt like that at some point but gyuvin definitely does wayyy too much
