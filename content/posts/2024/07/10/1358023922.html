      <p>I agree but itâ€™s not so much I find it boring itâ€™s just on his own heâ€™s usually doing lives in a more chilled out chatty sort of way instead of hyped and itâ€™s usually later at night. Itâ€™s not for me and I get it but I wouldnâ€™t say boring more than heâ€™s just not high tension in his lives and some people prefer that others donâ€™t. In comparison I love when he does his dance lives because I like things that a higher energy.</p>

      <p>I love Hanbin but I cannot lie he makes me cringe sooo much sometimes his fanservice doesn't feel flirty and laidback it's very try hard and forced, honestly Gunwook would throw me off at the beginning but he's cool now hanbin isn't as bad anymore too</p>

      <p>This is interesting because I feel like his lives used to be very fan servicy but recently for the last 2/3 months he doesnâ€™t really do it as much any more like heâ€™s mellowed out a lot in that regard</p>
