      <p>surprisingly.. I want gunwook team devil like ugh I know the whole world has given him trauma for his image but devil is sooo much more fun than angel but I wouldn't be opposed to Angel 

Team Angel - hanbin yujin taerae gyuvin Matthew 
Team devil - hao gunwook Ricky jiwoong 

I gotta be realistic and put the hate aside this is just what I see I feel like maybe yujin could be a devil too

      <p>it might be  too simplistic but hey it wk1, im guessing devils are the globalz (black hair) + gunwook (dark purple hair) and others are angels with light hair, so almost your list but swap jw and matt</p>
