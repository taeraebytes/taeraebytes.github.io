      <p>"doesn't he mostly sing that'd be boring" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ if you don't watch his lives how would you know what he mostly does? his live clips always go viral because of him joking with fans too</p>

      <p>ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ his only solo weibo live alone brought in thousands of new fans because of how viral it went on bilibili, clips from his live with jiwoong ricky and hanbin where he was dissing wakeone had so many views on yt shorts, his viral magnetic-sheesh remix moment having millions of views on twitter i could go on but that'd take me a whole week but whatever makes you sleep at night anon he's a flop nugu who has no fans and never goes viral</p>
