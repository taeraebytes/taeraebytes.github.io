      <p>I agree but itâ€™s not so much I find it boring itâ€™s just on his own heâ€™s usually doing lives in a more chilled out chatty sort of way instead of hyped and itâ€™s usually later at night. Itâ€™s not for me and I get it but I wouldnâ€™t say boring more than heâ€™s just not high tension in his lives and some people prefer that others donâ€™t. In comparison I love when he does his dance lives because I like things that a higher energy.</p>

      <p>I have an opposite opinion to anon. He actually became my bias through his lives because I really liked the chilled out chatty lives where it was a calm environment but he yaps a lot and tells little storyâ€™s or anecdotes about his day / the members. But I get why anon likes the high tension stuff more. I think i prefer this too because my last bias only used bubble like once a month and hanbin is someone who text every single day and goes live maybe 1 to 2 times a week so i like the little yapper catch ups he does at the end of the day, i like gunwooks lives too because itâ€™s pretty similar in style where heâ€™s usually just in his room chatting away giving us stories.</p>
