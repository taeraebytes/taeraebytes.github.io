      <p>i dont think smngg is actually coming this year especially when theyre still looking for members like... are they just gonna add someone and prepare for debut immediately? i thought they would have candidates and see who fits the best with the group at least</p>

      <p>Sm are very inconsistent with their plans and can randomly debut groups out of nowhere suddenly with a whole different lineup aka riize you never know what expect although they have been promoting smngg pretty heavily this year</p>

      <p>I was waiting for the smnbg since 2020 since I'm usually tuned in for their music (personally am disappointed with riize discography so far tho) at first they were supposed to debut in 2020 aespa q1 smnbg q4 anyways aespa debuted later and then we kept getting teased w smnbg every year but they would never debut

Sm used to have two groups of trainees for males one for NCT one for smnbg sungtaro were for NCT obviously but when they revealed the three new guys I think in 2022 for sm rookies we didn't know where they would go and neither did sm I think , the issue was that sm have been internally in shambles for the past three years but especially this past year and a half anddd there's a huge shortage of male trainees, when bp happened they knew it was time to debut a bg and just took 4 trainees they felt satisfied by and subgtaro because nct was now unsustainable  that's why riize have no chemistry and why vocally they can be a bit disappointing for an sm group</p>

      <p>yea definitely if it weren't for bp riize wouldn't have debuted they really rushed to pop them out esp considering how long they've been stalling to debut a new bg and damn why nobody knows each other frðŸ˜­
