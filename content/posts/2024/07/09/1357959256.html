    "question": "Twitter has selective amnesia serena does not rate kordell at all bro she was friendzoning him the entire time and left him on the dance floor. In the after sun right before casa she said she excited to see the new bombshells. She’s not upset ab his betrayal but ab how he embarrassed her on national TV. I’m loving the theatrics tho it’s good TV",
    "reply": "it's not about that sorry I think Serena likes kordell but it's less than he likes her which is fine it's enough to want to be in a couple. She may have sidelined him a couple times but again she knew this guy for like two weeks and she didn't disrespect him as she was trying other connections idc 🤷‍♀️ and yes she is upset ab his betrayal.. before she was shown the video she was sick and crying missing him like are we watching the same show 😭????? Kordell disrespected their entire relationship and she's in the right 🤷‍♀️ she was very verbal and honest about her actions her only crime was being a slow burner and liking him less than he likes her"
