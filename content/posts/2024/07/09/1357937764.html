      <p>I was stalking kfans and everyone's confused it's called "rock festival" but the theme seems to be that baby thing for Korean 1 yr olds cuz yknow they're 1 now and now that I'm thinking about it ever since children's day they've been talking about that a lot ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm so confused but excited like content for the remainder of July is smart the fandom activity will pick back up and just generate more consistent hype for the cb. Hmmm I really hope they stay somewhat true to the name like "rocky festival" please give us something crazy A LA DAY6ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚? But we'll be getting a temu version of that ðŸ˜’ but there's a live segment idk if it's just a simple live or performance .... 7/10 COME FASTERRRRRR
