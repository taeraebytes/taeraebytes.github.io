      <p>ou so zb1Ê¼s concept photos photographer apparently works for thel1ve and is close friends with that manager song. she was also the one who filmed hanbin's debut shoot and she recently talked about his hair change with the manager in kkt chat posted in their ig story. so thel1ve is really hands on with zb1? 

her ig is kikiki0505 and you can see be_settled_ (thel1ve manager who also handles auditions for iland) commenting under her posts</p>

      <p>Sheâ€™s not an employee from the l1ve they just know eachother? Do anons think people in this industry donâ€™t make friends or connections. Sheâ€™s worked with a lot of starship (mainly Iâ€™ve) and cube artist too.</p>

      <p>i didnâ€™t even say she was an employee of thel1ve cause photographers are usually outsourced i said apparently she works for the l1ve and somehow has connections with them seeing how she was the one who shot hanbinâ€™s debut shoot? this was probably a recommendation to wakeone so thel1ve and other members og companies are well involved with them (obviously) some of you guys are so defensive ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I haven't seen her actually do work for thel1ve just cuz I don't see wheein in there but she did do the hanbin shoot could be a favor could be outsourcing who knows but yea we know the companies are involved but still that would make every company she's worked for her affiliation ðŸ˜­? Idt this is rlly an example of thel1ve being involved w wakeone
