      <p>ou so zb1Ê¼s concept photos photographer apparently works for thel1ve and is close friends with that manager song. she was also the one who filmed hanbin's debut shoot and she recently talked about his hair change with the manager in kkt chat posted in their ig story. so thel1ve is really hands on with zb1? 

her ig is kikiki0505 and you can see be_settled_ (thel1ve manager who also handles auditions for iland) commenting under her posts</p>

      <p>She didnâ€™t buy jiwoongs doll she bought hanbinâ€™s but they sent jiwoongs although apparently this was an issue because i saw loads of kallins saying they got sent woongnini instead of Binini. Also the lady doesnâ€™t work for the hanbinâ€™s label sheâ€™s just friends with the director but she shoots for multiple groups from different agencies.</p>
