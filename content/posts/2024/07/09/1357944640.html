      <p>Solo ig doesn't seem likely because when the two kep members left they made igs right away but the ones who stayed didnt, jiwoong just got his ego hurt cause he's not 1m followers</p>

      <p>The way wakeone been riding his dick even post scandal just tells me they're more lenient towards him for whatever reason. I mean they even allow him to not live in the dorms with the other members knowing how crucial dorm bonding is for the team because that's when theyre 'off work' and they have to know kzeroses are already suss about it yet he still ain't living with them even with upgraded dorms.</p>
