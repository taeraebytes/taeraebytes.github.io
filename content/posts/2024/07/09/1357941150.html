Whatâ€™s even more interesting since anons mentioned the l1ve is that if you go back on @agency_prod on insta you can see a photographer called Kim Cham is the one who shot wheeinâ€™s albums pics so it just disproves the whole thing of her shooting ZB1â€™s stuff because she knows hanbinâ€™s agency director, because if that was the case wouldnâ€™t she have shot the l1ve artists photos too?

      <p>ou so zb1Ê¼s concept photos photographer apparently works for thel1ve and is close friends with that manager song. she was also the one who filmed hanbin's debut shoot and she recently talked about his hair change with the manager in kkt chat posted in their ig story. so thel1ve is really hands on with zb1? 

her ig is kikiki0505 and you can see be_settled_ (thel1ve manager who also handles auditions for iland) commenting under her posts</p>

      <p>Sheâ€™s not an employee from the l1ve they just know eachother? Do anons think people in this industry donâ€™t make friends or connections. Sheâ€™s worked with a lot of starship (mainly Iâ€™ve) and cube artist too.</p>

      <p>i didnâ€™t even say she was an employee of thel1ve cause photographers are usually outsourced i said apparently she works for the l1ve and somehow has connections with them seeing how she was the one who shot hanbinâ€™s debut shoot? this was probably a recommendation to wakeone so thel1ve and other members og companies are well involved with them (obviously) some of you guys are so defensive ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I haven't seen her actually do work for thel1ve just cuz I don't see wheein in there but she did do the hanbin shoot could be a favor could be outsourcing who knows but yea we know the companies are involved but still that would make every company she's worked for her affiliation ðŸ˜­? Idt this is rlly an example of thel1ve being involved w wakeone

      <p>i think i saw somewhere that she closely works with ravi / vixx before so ig she and thel1ve are long time partner and it makes sense for them to ask her to work with hanbin (and as extension wakeone)</p>
