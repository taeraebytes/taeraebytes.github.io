 Iâ€™m on the verge of becoming a tweaker. Like I tolerated jiwoong this whole time but idk something about this is really making me irked by him. Like you could argue the first time was an accident but then he took ages to take it back down but to do it a second time and then make the account public. Now Iâ€™m thinking there has to be something in the works because there just ainâ€™t no way a company lets this slide for a rookie especially not twice and making it public, like Yujin from kep1er has an insta but she had to make it private and not once did she make it public. Thereâ€™s no way heâ€™s doing all this without company approval. Also for the people saying it might be an ambassadorship that doesnâ€™t make any sense because hao literally has a ba role but no personal ig account ( unless yuehua has specifically stated they donâ€™t want they yhz to have personal accounts) but even then that just creates more divide, and if it is an ambassadorship rosins will go mental at hao not having one. Solo instas are also a terrible idea like weâ€™re literally talking in here about the lack of ot9 fanbases and translation accounts what we need is more group stuff not the further push on individuality of the members. Tbh this is the main reason I can fathoms contract extension because every move seems to be just setting up the members for careers away from the group post zb1 because how are they being promoted more as individuals than as a group.</p>

      <p>literally like there is no way the company is not aware of his ig at this point I 100% believe they're aware but why are they allowing it like why why why and ur right I rlly don't think it's for ambassadorship reasons Gucci almost dropped him and who seriously would try to market him to the public that hates him.. like what is the reason it makes no sense ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ he's just so selfish and evil in everything he does ugh I hate him so much like how are we supposed to ignore him and move on from him literally ruining zb1 if he does weird shit like this and it's beyond me why he's allowed to
