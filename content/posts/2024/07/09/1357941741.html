But hmmmm I'm bad at my hobbies too unless I'm in school and need something to get away from but idk I just watch anime or play games in my free time. Maybe try getting into art? Like doing simple outdoors paintings of what's in front of you or whenever you're at home chill at the library instead for a change of scenery. I can't lie nothings as satisfying as a social life but it's hard starting a brand new one as an adult cuz u don't got 8 hr days to force u to socialize try meeting new people too if u can"
