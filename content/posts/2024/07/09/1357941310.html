      <p>ou so zb1Ê¼s concept photos photographer apparently works for thel1ve and is close friends with that manager song. she was also the one who filmed hanbin's debut shoot and she recently talked about his hair change with the manager in kkt chat posted in their ig story. so thel1ve is really hands on with zb1? 

her ig is kikiki0505 and you can see be_settled_ (thel1ve manager who also handles auditions for iland) commenting under her posts</p>

      <p>i remember seeing a tiktok from denise ex-secret number and she said lots of the times for music shows their stylists will have really cool ideas for outfits for the idols to wear but they'll either have limited resources or some of the idol company staff will make them scrap it and do something that's a lot less cool or harder to dance in etc etc so i wonder if the photographers/editors also have situations like that, they have cool ideas but can't execute them well bc at the end of the day it's the company's final say</p>
