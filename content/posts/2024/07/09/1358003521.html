      <p>he had 44 cafes in korea 84 cafes in general but these are the ones op could find on twitter/weibo by posts made by visitors so itâ€™s not the exact number. idk why a c-allin of all people was the only one who made this summary though

      <p>nobody is announcing cafes like a day before his bday most likely this is about 90% of his cafes because they've all been planned months in advance and need an appropriate time frame to garner attention for the event

      <p>Yeah I also went to one of these in Korea and most would have been announced by now because you have to â€˜bookâ€™ a place for most of these too so they can prepare enough stuff in advance</p>
