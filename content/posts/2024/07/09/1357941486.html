      <p>Omfg pls no cuz then it's gonna get political. Idk what day it is but there's this holiday or something where all chinese influencer, idol, actor etc and k idols always have to make a post. Like you have to in order to stay in c-ent so staff just make the post for them usually and chinese kidols always get so much backlash. Like wakeone please don't even touch solo weibos I BEGGG</p>

      <p>HRNFNDNJDMDKKDKDKMD when they pledge allegiance to one China they most certainly cannot do that when they're idols but they will eventually if they start promoting there often but they're not getting solo weibos don't worry ðŸ˜­
