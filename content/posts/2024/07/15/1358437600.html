 I understand the fan reviews now. They said Matthew, and Hanbin's face looked small, and he looked white. And that hao had broad shoulders probably because he used shoulder pads, they looked wide the last time he wore it too. Is it only me who notices the difference in Hao's expression, he looks a little tired.</p>
