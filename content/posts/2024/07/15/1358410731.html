      <p>Idk if you guys saw that empire state of mind that someone did with 127 but omg that edit still gives me goosebumps. 127 ran the states idc. 

They could be royalty and more but sm decided to favor nct dream like fuck them.</p>

      <p>Yea dream was kind of a stupid choice since they were more popular in sea and korea but 127 had a hold on the west

      <p>127 was pushed for ages lol and thats why they got their american fanbase. Dream was at the side but still got popular in korea and sea. After dream became permanent, sm started treating them like a normal group. Sm's faves in nct are the boom unit who get evrything.</p>

      <p>Really hot take but I think as a whole group 127 was probably one of the strongest kpop bg like exo have way better vocals but here there was a certain charisma, confidence and stage presence exo never had plus decent vocals dancing and rap while also taking musical risks and having a super creative team, and I personally don't even like a single member expect maybe doyoung? But like they could've gone far in the us they had IT</p>

      <p>Oh sis I agree 127 were the kings at their prime even tho they're the worst lineup to grace this world like we had to ignore all that back then THEY WERE JYST TOOOO GOOD like them together was so good we ignored the demonic energy
