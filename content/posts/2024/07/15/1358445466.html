I get the upset since all we do is complain about the work that gets poured into the group and the lack of quality and care it's pretty jarring to see and disappointing. But I'm also considering the creative freedom idols get on aotm as well and they really would do just about anything the idols request on there so it wouldn't have been hard to get him an og song to sing to if he asked for one esp since I've been getting other ccs saying it was made by the people who made dear eclipse so it could've been a demo who knows. Then there's the other Side of people bringing up always well idk if hanbin would ever perform this song outside of the video and have the song officially released so idk ab all that but damn this got way too long but im just trynna say i don't care or at least not like most of the people who are mad like the aotm isn't really gonna help the group in any way so what he does with is whatever to me it was always going to be something that would just benefit him anyways"
