      <p>tbh actually putting time and effort in zb1's popularity would benefit yuehua more than having the yuehuaz short term and then having them disband bc yuehua cannot manage shit if zb1 got even more popular with time and they allowed hao to promote in China too like yuqi and the svt members they'd definitely have more than without zb1</p>

      <p>right if they  just offered connections and employees to wakeone it's better than trying to create their own group then ultimately squashing it

      <p>THISSS, everyone on their mama thinks yh will be the reason for zb1 not extending, but by then (hopefully) tempest will be either disbanded or just in poverty and everglow either on their 10th hiatus or disbanded too. can yuehua kr really afford to get rid of a safe stream of income they have through yuehuaz and hao rn? it may be small but they can later negotiate, and hao can be in a popular group whilst doing c-ent activities. PLEASE YUEHUA IF YOU CAN HEAR US.</p>

      <p>I mean it's a valid reason yuehua most likely will there's just a sliver of a chance now since the company has taken so many Ls and literally sucks but all we can do is pray which never works
