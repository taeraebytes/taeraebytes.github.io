      <p>Also on my last point about apologising it's why I wish hanbin and Taerae would stop addressing EVERYTHING it becomes si abundantly clear to your whole audience that you're hyper aware and insecure like be a little more nonchalant and assertive please!!! Hao with his non direct blow ups is bad too, control your emotions don't let too much of yourself to your insane audience ESPECIALLY if you don't like them</p>

      <p>Hanbinâ€™s only every publicly apologised for two things and both those things needed an apology but I agree with Taerae directly adressing his fans complaints about the hair for example like donâ€™t give too much power there</p>

      <p>I feel like anyone that drives knows hanbin was actually using a navigation like it was so regular and it's not like he was being unsafe

      <p>no actually i needed a personal apology written in blood and tears sent to my house idols that are weird about food like that make me want to claw my eyes out if i wanted to reignite my eating disorder id just get deep on tumblr again. theyâ€™re probably all like that behind the scenes but like keep that shit to yourselvesâ€¦. this is why im yeojin is public enemy number one i never forgave her. gyuvin public enemy number two but i can forgive him because hes jusf a little clueless and has never directly told his fans to starve themselves</p>

      <p>You need a personal apology from idols who are most likely going through eds themselves and are stuck in an industry that glorifies and praises them for being as thin as possible because they are weird about food? Are you hearing yourself? If itâ€™s triggering to you maybe take some time away but try to have basic empathy for these idol and not Iâ€™m not saying baby them but understand that they are in an industry that does not want them to get better nor get over this ed mindset</p>
