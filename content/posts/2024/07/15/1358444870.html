      <p>Scorpio rising quietly intense and alluring AF!! Super intuitive you can't hide shit from them, usually went through a lot of trauma very self protective and mysterious, secretive when you get to know them tho they can be pretty funny in a sarcastic sometimes vulgar way can be really obsessive and manipulative, cool and collected energy
