      <p>I like the lineup but no gunwooks gonna be the bastard childðŸ˜‘...... yuehua fans already have an allegiance to one another (these whores also used to be some of gunwooks biggest haters..) and the members themselves have time on gunwook like the company squashing their own groups aside I CANT SUBJECT GUNWOOK TO ALIENATION!!!!!!!!!!! I do like the lineup tho
