      <p>The thing is that most kiof fans in Korea have Haneul as a bias and she's not as enthusiastic about the concept as other members are so they see it from that perspective. And bc they are relaying on this sexy concept it limits haneul screentime and also lines which it's like nice bc she's a minor but also I understand why they are getting this annoyed</p>

      <p>I feel like intl fans don't realize that since natty and the other two are popular overseas but she's not a minor she's 05 right? She's still so young so I get it I think it goes w the image the group goes for but she def seems the least enthusiastic and my thing is the choreo was so out of place like what're we doing on the concrete ðŸ˜­

      <p>I really think haneul was a mismatch for the group, i think she pulls of every concept very well but in the eyes of the gp and intl fans shes invisible, the other members personalities are just so strong compared to her being.. well just the maknae. if there were other 2 members who didnt have such strong presence she would have stood out more i think. and her vocals are just sooo underutilised as in its very overlooked for natty who automatically gets lines and belle's yg-like voice. haneul could be main vocalist in any 4th gen gg but nobody recognises her vocals, bar midas touch</p>

      <p>Haneul can't be a main vocalist in any 4th gen gg please she's only on chaewon levels or even below her natty has the same skill set as her kiof vocals are so overblow because of belle and her stylistic singing that ppl think she herself is on lily/wendy levels when she's not even close and that everyone else in the group are excellent singers when they're just... Not</p>

      <p>Anon she literally sang the korean national anthem at a game recently and please chaewon is a good singer but she couldnt pull of midas touch without sounding strained as fuck. Also nattys tone helps her shes not as good as haneul, also sorry but shes the autotune queen somehow she can never pull off her lines in real compared to in the studio</p>

      <p>When people speak about vocals and have no idea how vocal technique works so what if she sang the korean national anthem ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ danielle sang the little mermaid theme does that mean she's very good? chaewon can sing midas touch natty haneul and chaewon all contain breath support upto G#4 but chaewon has occassionally pulled off A4 I was being generous chaewon is actually slightly better don't try it anon and natty and hanuel have the exact same skill set you think haneul is better because of her stylistic choices</p>
