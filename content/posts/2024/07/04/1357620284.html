      <p>Your inbox is probably gonna filled w hair color discussion but I just have to give my two cents sorry yujin is beautiiiful perfect color for him I'm glad they took some risks finally w cheonanz but I am afraid this is not it..Hanbin still looks good at least although the hair Def needs to be toned (also isn't the colour the same as Haos previous one? Are they inviting the comparaison to drive competition? But taerae omg it's just HORRID he needs to go back black ASAPPP!!!</p>
