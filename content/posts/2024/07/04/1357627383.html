      <p>what are they getting??? if you're talking about big company payola it's for their entire groups like i wish we had that payola for zb1 and their charts and  even the most popular ones like wonbin and shinyu have zero solo gigs and also cj is literally just as big they have connections in every single corner of the industry please</p>

      <p>I'm aware it's group stuff but nothing hanbin has gotten is on the level so how r we calling this broke dh gate level payola biggest industry plant stuff like come onğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and yes cj is capable but clearly they don't care because it's been a year and they've barely pulled strings for the whole group outside of 2 weeks of in bloom promo like i can call hanbin favored or privileged but this is no "biggest industry plant" stuff... HE MCED FOR THE WORST SURVIVAL SHOW EVER ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ all im saying is to call him the biggest industry plant is crazy yall haven't seen nothing big yet
