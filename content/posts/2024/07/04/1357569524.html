 the keplians in the qrts are funny like on what planet would it go to chaehyun ðŸ˜­ i mean i guess they think that since somi was p01 in ioi but like what was that ? Nearly
9 years ago â€¦ she was already a guest mentor on the show and itâ€™s more likely sheâ€™s there because of how involved the black label is. Also she does mama a lot and did bp like itâ€™s really not a shocker. Iâ€™m confused as to why they have to MCs for the final though tbh it seems pretty unnecessary .</p>
