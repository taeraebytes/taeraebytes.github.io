      <p>I like the lineup but no gunwooks gonna be the bastard childðŸ˜‘...... yuehua fans already have an allegiance to one another (these whores also used to be some of gunwooks biggest haters..) and the members themselves have time on gunwook like the company squashing their own groups aside I CANT SUBJECT GUNWOOK TO ALIENATION!!!!!!!!!!! I do like the lineup tho

      <p>honestly the allegiance is gonna end in like less than a month of debut once the stans realise theres no use in putting in that much effort for a flop group</p>

      <p>Nah people will continue to honor the fact that they're yuehua trainees I'd literally rather jump because gunwook not being a trainee would be constantly highlighted like I'm all good off that
