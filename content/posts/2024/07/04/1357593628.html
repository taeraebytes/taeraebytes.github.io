      <p>Numbers of times 5th generation idols trended in Korea during the first half of 2024 (January 1 - July 2)

#1 #ZHANGHAO of #ZEROBASEONE - 113
#2 #SUNGHANBIN of #ZEROBASEONE - 68
#3 #WONBIN of #RIIZE - 65
#4 #NOAH of #PLAVE - 59
#5 #EUNSEOK of #RIIZE - 52
#6 #BAMBY of #PLAVE - 34
-KBG charts

So random... But yeah, seeing plave here means that twitter is where the new generation of fans are lurking. This is also an indicator that KZerose is bigger and the most active 5th gen fandom. and that Plave and Riize are definitely gp. Also, twitter is still a foreign concept for K-media and brands to even gaf. Twitter is really the most important platform for Zeroses worldwide...</p>
