      <p>I started crying as soon as I saw what they did to taerae 🙂🔫

the fact that they’re doing this to him when his entire kr fandom is still traumatized by the purple hair is insane I genuinely can’t believe it. It’s like they’re actively trying to make all of his fans leave
this is the #1 thing that they have a problem with and it’s also their ONLY REASONABLE DEMAND?? like i don’t think it’s unreasonable for people to want him to have eyebrows and hair on his scalp…?
I love him and I’ll never leave no matter what but I can’t even blame people for leaving at this point Like the entire period where he had purple hair was so fucking miserable EVEN AZURE LEFT LMFAO

HE HAS NO EYEBROWS…..THEY’RE GONEEEEE</p>
