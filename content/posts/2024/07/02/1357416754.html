      <p>Tbh I get the sentiment of their kfans and some knetz it's usually common for female idols to be pushed onto doing these concepts and dances, and I think theyre scared of the imminent sexualisation of kiof as this song kinda opens them up to a whole new audience (though they have had viral fancams and moves before). But this case it's on the fans to either support the cb or not, they expressed a lot that they wanted this kind of song. Their creative director who they credit for all their concepts is a woman and tbh men would sexualise any concept in kpop (same for women).</p>

 Yeah it doesnâ€™t seem like theyâ€™re being pushed into the concept in this case. Based off of things theyâ€™re said and done, it seems like they want that image</p>
