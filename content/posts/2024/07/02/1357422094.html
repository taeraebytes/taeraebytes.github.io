      <p>honestly i bet he's kicking himself for not doing it earlier, i know i would. imagine he had that face during bp, and he's very skilled. obviously the mnet gods would have to be on his side, but if he did have screentime i think he would have done well as a cute guy role like jihoon, dongpyo or daewhi , maybe he would have been the dancer version of taerae</p>

      <p>it's probably because of his company and new group he got a new face so he wouldn't have had it for bp and he'd probably get trolled for being a plastic monster ðŸ˜­
