      <p>The thing is that most kiof fans in Korea have Haneul as a bias and she's not as enthusiastic about the concept as other members are so they see it from that perspective. And bc they are relaying on this sexy concept it limits haneul screentime and also lines which it's like nice bc she's a minor but also I understand why they are getting this annoyed</p>

      <p>I feel like intl fans don't realize that since natty and the other two are popular overseas but she's not a minor she's 05 right? She's still so young so I get it I think it goes w the image the group goes for but she def seems the least enthusiastic and my thing is the choreo was so out of place like what're we doing on the concrete ðŸ˜­
