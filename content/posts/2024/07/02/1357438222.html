      <p>Ok but can we talk about how genius it was for them to have the casa girls be more “attractive”  than the OG girls (in the eyes of the men ofc because most of them are their ideal types) like it really puts them to the test and show how they aren’t shit and will rlly drop these girls at any moment, can’t wait for movie night.</p>
