      <p>did taerae say something kind of colourist on plus chat today because i have the app and got a notification, my iphone translated it to something about his skin colour being dark so i think it's typical korean beauty standard self hatred but not sure since it's machine translated, but then i go to the taerae translation account i follow and they skipped over it despite it being the first reply he did i'm pretty sure ðŸ˜­ i mean i'm not that surprised but....</p>

      <p>HDNRNFRNFJMFDMFMKCKX crying at how lotus predicted this i guess the translation acc skipped it in case of backlash but i haven't seen it myself but from what ur saying it just seems like typical idol colorism ou

      <p>haven't seen anyone translating it and if we don't have an accurate translation we can't really judge but I do know that kfans have been praising his pale skin tone for a really really long time now and he also reacted positively when kfans said he has pretty and fair legs so I assume it means that he himself wants to stay pale because he knows his fans like it and also because he himself likes it (there once was this picture of the member showing off their self made bracelets and everyone was losing it over how white taerae's hand was so im not surprised)</p>

      <p>there could be a plethora of reasons and it's not like he's said anything out of the idol ordinary I can tell u seem kinda worried but he'll be aight and I dont think it's that bad like irdc he wants to stay pale they have a standard yes it's rooted in colorism but cmon this is kpop

      <p>yeah in geontael fics the skin color difference between gw and tr gets highlighted more than their height difference ðŸ˜¬ also skin color is wrong thing you have to see how they act over idols having like pink elbows, fingers, etc. they go crazy over that</p>

      <p>Taerae is the lightest but his foundation matches his skin while his arms are usually covered. For Ricky, you can clearly see that it's one shade lighter. You won't see it in their Korean contents but it was so obvious in Running man and Kmedia snaps</p>
