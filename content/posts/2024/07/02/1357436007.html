      <p>Yeah they also got into a lot of controversy for their ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù on variety shows lmaoo it‚Äôs a lot in general and it‚Äôs rlly crazy to me how much idols got away with stuff in the past like hyuna lifting up Krystal‚Äôs shirts in front of a bunch of boys during a game got her a bunch of backlash but I feel like she should‚Äôve gotten even more heat</p>
