      <p>I don't like when you guys talk about my friends when you don't know nothing can u stop.. she didn't beg me for anything she wanted to create a space for rosins to talk freely and it got too negative nobody wants to spend their stan experience in a constant state of upset so she chose her peace üòë I operate simply because I talk too much and have a knack for arguing not to mention I've been gossip centered more than anything leave my sister alone
