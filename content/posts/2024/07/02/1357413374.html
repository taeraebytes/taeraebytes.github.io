      <p>it's so weird seriously how do you watch him slowly giving up trying to ignore the criticism and seeming more hopeless by the day and still having the nerve to complain about everything it's so annoying especially because she wrote a supportive message like two days ago when he made that comment about working out on live ðŸ˜• it's so annoying if you want to criticise everything about him then just stan someone else</p>

      <p>It just really seems like she's nitpicking everything about him like I'm not understanding there's a line when it comes to critique but this is way beyond that I feel bad
