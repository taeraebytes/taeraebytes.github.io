      <p>there's no ricky's pubg repo. he is really nugu in korea or k-zerose didn't wanna talk about him?? even rukidans big account didn't care about his pubg whereabout. lol. his preview also usually came late than other member, has less fansite on fansign. it's only pic he didn't have video from fansign unless it's cp fans/fs</p>
