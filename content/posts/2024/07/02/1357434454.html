      <p>The thing is that most kiof fans in Korea have Haneul as a bias and she's not as enthusiastic about the concept as other members are so they see it from that perspective. And bc they are relaying on this sexy concept it limits haneul screentime and also lines which it's like nice bc she's a minor but also I understand why they are getting this annoyed</p>
