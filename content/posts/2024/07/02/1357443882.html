    "question": "it might be bc the overall cost of everything (equipment, backup dancers, set, filming, etc) would’ve been cheaper overseas vs korea? they did the same with their 5 debut mvs (they filmed them all in hungary bc it’s a lot cheaper to film there) whoever manages their finances does it very well bc their music videos have a small budget they just use it to the fullest since it’s so limited",
    "reply": "I have no clue which is cheaper but I feel like the mv is so lackluster because of the location the choreo already didn't match the song but the mv just made it worse"

      <p>Kiof's mv is a clear example of money laundering, why go to poland when the mv only shows 3 places instead they could easily find a pretty korean beach for the mv and save money for other things</p>
