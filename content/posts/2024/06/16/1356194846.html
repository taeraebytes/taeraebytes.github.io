      <p>Why I feel like Yujin, Gunwook, Taerae was absolutely not pannchoa admin pick durinv BP because she was posting that sohee stick leg with 20 comments, whilst others have already posted more comments than that, Yujin was literally trending a few days ago for visuals. Gunwook was also mentioned for being all rounder, she is definitely hanbin and Ricky biased from ZB1 and stan RIIZE in general, She cherry picked ZB1 hate articles as well. I need this bitch to be gone like BBOSONGEEEEE.</p>

      <p>No, you are both missing my point. This is known as sympathy marketing. If you constantly post negative articles but those articles bring sympathy to you, it is still a win for them. People began sympathizing with Sohee rather than hating him, and constant wonbin articles make people think that because he is so attractive, people are attempting to bring him down. If someone writes 6 constant bad articles about Yujin slandering his looks, habits, and lack of emotions and posts them on Pann's Twitter account, I bet the same people who don't like Stan ZB1 will start loving him too, thinking they are deliberately targeting a child, and since Yujin is still a child, trust me, he will get more sympathy and love.</p>

      <p>In the sense of sohee yea but posting monthly articles ab someone's bad dancing gets them no grace like Anton did not gain anything from that. But in the case of sohee he got lucky because of the complex intl fans have where they have to glaze an unconventional member so the visual hate on top of that got him token stans plus his vocals. But before riize her hate for sm artists would only further ignite them getting dragged
