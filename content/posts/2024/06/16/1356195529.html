      <p>usually management and all that other staff that works in a company that arent the idols.. it basically seems like a media studies/communications degree</p>

      <p>is it? cuz i remember hanbin told he learnt how to detect the camera change while on stage from his major idt the kpop major is basically media studies/comms and he always had to practice performances for his projects thats how he had a lot of videos uploaded on youtube from his uni days. i really think kpop major is almost like trainees in a company but i could be wrong</p>

      <p>I rlly don't know it's an odd major because it seems like it would only benefit trainees but like I'm sure half of the students aren't
