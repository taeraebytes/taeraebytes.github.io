    "question": "ehhhhhhh is it tho? bc hanbin's tiktok with the balloons spell out HB for hanbin, not HBD or HB for happy birthday, and it was gifted by allure rather than wakeone, posted around (or on? i don't keep track) his birthday bc that's when they released the covers and they tend to release tiktoks filmed at events or for promos when that event/promo happens. i don't think that's anything to tweak over. when i went on a riyangi account tho they were complaining about the ena show and ricky not being included in something, anyone know what that's about?",
    "reply": "it's the ena show I think u got it mixed up they celebrated Matt and hanbins bdays only and they're upset since Ricky and matty are 8 days apart but apparently filming was 1 day after? Or before matthews bday and the thing aired like a day before hanbins so"
