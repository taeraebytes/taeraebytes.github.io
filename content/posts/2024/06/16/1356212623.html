      <p>riyangis are mad that they didn't include ricky here where this was recorded 9 days after his bday, are they stupid, the actual program was aired in 14th june, i think they only meant to celebrate hanbin's bday which was 1 day before the actual air date but since matthew's bday was 1 day before the recording that's why they celebrated both of their bday

      <p>Will it kill them to include the member who celebrated his birthday 9 days before the recording? It's still in May... ENA is so wrong. It's not about the other members, but the common sense. Only 3 members have birthdays Â±9 days of the recording/airing, excluding one feels so wrong.</p>
