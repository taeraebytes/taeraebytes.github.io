      <p>where did y'all think the 1M sales came from LMFAOOOO the sales declined badly this time so prepare for the fansigns to last a few other months like wakeone and cj did everything they could to get this much sales and it's why they didn't brag about it this time ğŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>anon we aint riize where they had to STILL be doing gag fansigns till jan even when talk saxy & 119 was out ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€

we only have 8ish fansigns/ calls left and they're all in june. pretty sure we did less than 30 fansigns/ calls this comeback cuz our fandom actually bought the albums unlike sm where they bought their own albums to inflate first weeks sales stats so they had no choice but to hold 100 fansigns cuz all their albums were sitting in storage ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ rmb them 'selling' 300k albums or some shit on a fucking sunday ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>
