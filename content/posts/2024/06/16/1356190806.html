      <p>Ok unpopular opinion but Tyla and her team are not smart ðŸ˜­ like her going on the breakfast club couldâ€™ve been the perfect opportunity to address the colored vs black situation but instead they decided to be ignorant and shun down the whole convo instead of explaining themselves (I did some personal research and found out her management team is the same ppl who work with awkwafina so that makes alot of sense lol) but like again Her entire team is going to ruin her career. she needs to fire everyone and re evaluate her career. You will never make it without the support of black American because it will literally make or break your career without the support because non blk ppl donâ€™t care abt her and no one in America is going to use the term colored especially in todays context and the nerve of them to think South Africans will carry her fanbase when the biggest SA artists struggle to even get streams in their own home countries ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>

      <p>That's like one of her biggest hurdles why would they try to ignore it or dismiss the conversation ehhhhðŸ˜­??? Like how's she supposed to make it in America without explaining an entirely different racial construct whilst promoting to a black audience AH HELL NAH and awkwafina team....ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ wow. Yea she really needs to figure out how she wants to present herself in Americas structure like it's not gonna work otherwise
