I remember even kyungsoo mentioned he wanted to appear on lmj since it was a nice show to showcase his vocals all alone (he was promoting his solo album) so buddy even Hao wasn‚Äôt invited by lmj. The only guest invited on that show were for their special 100th episode (dk if they did any other special episode beside this) but anyone appearing during their cb on that show is to promote their album and not because lmj wanted them on the show lmao",
