 even with all the push this comeback, gigs, event appearances and even national baseball appearance gunwook still cant make it back in the BR list ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ been out for months because aside from the fandom nobody gaf about this sasaeng smoocher

      <p>It was so obvious. Last year, SM wasn't paying that old man to include Riize in BR ranking. Wonbin and even Seunghan were never included even if they're making so much noise in SK. But when TWS debuted in January and they gained attention, SM was threatened and finally paid the BR old man to bring Riize members to the fucking top of the ranking. SM doesn't see ZB1 as threat, I'm so mad. ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>brand rankings donâ€™t mean anything esp when you realise the man that makes those lists will remove people if they go against his nationalistic ideals like removing idols from certain provinces he deems less than & idols who arenâ€™t korean(+ anybody he considers a gyopo). take those lists w a grain of salt.</p>
