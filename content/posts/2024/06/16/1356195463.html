      <p>random but today i've noticed taerae's lips look a bit different and after promotions they seem to have had time to chill out so i feel like he might've gotten lip fillers.....? like in this video to me they look a bit bigger than what i remember

 and then i remembered he posted this on plus chat which reminds me of when hoshi got veneers and kept posting videos of him smiling afterwards lmfao

 but i also remember he went to the dentist recently and apparently got some type of braces so that could've affected how his lips look? any thoughts?</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ THE SECOND LINK IS FRYING MEðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's like hyunjae he would post his terrible filler swollen lipsFRESH BTW without a care in the world and he's known to have insanely thin lips this is killing me but yea icl the first link his lips look thicker than what I rmbr ðŸ¤” idk what dental procedure he got done but traditional braces don't puff up ur lips they almost do the opposite cuz ur mouth was so stretched out it's all cracked up and dry and the lines are very apparent
