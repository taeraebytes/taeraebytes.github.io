      <p>tbh it wouldnt matter much at all if hao wasnt center. heâ€™s the second best vocalist in the group, theyâ€™re gonna shove his voice in every chorus regardless. heâ€™d get the exact same amount of lines. the only thing that would change is that rosins couldnt tweak out when hes not in the exact middle of every photo in existence</p>
