 even with all the push this comeback, gigs, event appearances and even national baseball appearance gunwook still cant make it back in the BR list ğŸ˜­ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ been out for months because aside from the fandom nobody gaf about this sasaeng smoocher

go ahead and use the same excuse & say this is rigged but isnt even sadder and more pathetic for gunwook that even a rigged br list doesnt want him ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€</p>
