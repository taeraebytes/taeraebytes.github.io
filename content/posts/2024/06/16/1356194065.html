      <p>where did y'all think the 1M sales came from LMFAOOOO the sales declined badly this time so prepare for the fansigns to last a few other months like wakeone and cj did everything they could to get this much sales and it's why they didn't brag about it this time ğŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>anon we aint riize where they had to STILL be doing gag fansigns till jan even when talk saxy & 119 was out ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€

we only have 8ish fansigns/ calls left and they're all in june. pretty sure we did less than 30 fansigns/ calls this comeback cuz our fandom actually bought the albums unlike sm where they bought their own albums to inflate first weeks sales stats so they had no choice but to hold 100 fansigns cuz all their albums were sitting in storage ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ rmb them 'selling' 300k albums or some shit on a fucking sunday ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>it was so funny I rmb waking up at 4am to instiz blowing up and we were all here talking about it cuz someone leaked sm bought their albums/ single or w.e to inflate first weeks sales so they'll break the 'first week 1 mil sale' milestone ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ I wonder why sm was so desperate to break that milestone *cough *cough cuz of us. 

like its so normal for grps to have 20-30 fansigns just because theres so many different distributors and poca versions but if u need to have 60+ fansigns and for four+ months ?!?!?!?!?!! now thats a fucking problem ğŸ’€</p>
