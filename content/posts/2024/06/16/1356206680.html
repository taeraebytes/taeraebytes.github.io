      <p>Also I am sorry but when I see people saying that Wonbin or Yujin have the Cha Eunwoo potential it kills me a bit bc people are always saying that Eunwoo is boring and shit but if he's boring Yujin and Wonbin are even worse. When Eunwoo goes to variety shows he has that witty/cheeky charm that I personally don't see Yujin and Wonbin having bc Yujin don't even have that hunger for standing out while Wonbin is too worried about looking mysterious and handsome to emote.</p>
