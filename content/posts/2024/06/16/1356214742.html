      <p>Objectively I think wake one have been continuously assholes and dismissive towards Ricky in particular which actually hurts the groups popularity considering he's the most brandable and recognisable member thanks to his striking looks, I think we can all agree that he's limited by a lot but I don't think we can continuously say it's not that deep it's hard to ignore and I'm not a Ricky bias</p>

      <p>I can agree Ricky's underserved I never said he wasn't all Ive ever said was riyangis do too much and focus on the wrong things ALWAYS. my issue just comes in my cc when people try to note on my reactions like I'm not killing myself over anything that's not gonna change or when I say half the complaints aren't exclusive to Ricky oh and don't act surprised when I start saying smth cuz y'all irked me and I wanna troll
