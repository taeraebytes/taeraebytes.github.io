 even with all the push this comeback, gigs, event appearances and even national baseball appearance gunwook still cant make it back in the BR list ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ been out for months because aside from the fandom nobody gaf about this sasaeng smoocher

go ahead and use the same excuse & say this is rigged but isnt even sadder and more pathetic for gunwook that even a rigged br list doesnt want him ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>That ahjumma knows nobody from zb1 and was given a script to remember their names prolly a few mins ago with the way she immediately went SUNG HANBIN LEADER I KNOW like the memory kicked in suddenly. She donâ€™t know no hao or Gunwook from before she just remembered their names after 5-10 mins ago..</p>
