      <p>riyangis are mad that they didn't include ricky here where this was recorded 9 days after his bday, are they stupid, the actual program was aired in 14th june, i think they only meant to celebrate hanbin's bday which was 1 day before the actual air date but since matthew's bday was 1 day before the recording that's why they celebrated both of their bday
