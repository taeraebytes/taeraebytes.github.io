      <p>well idk about 4 but yuehua is definitely not letting go of hao and yujin, and tbh it really feels like wakeone is already on plans for zb2 all they care about rn is milk money from the group and not even promote them right, matthew said the members are talking about post disbandment, hanbin said he alr has plans after disbandment, the yuehuaz boom idk it just seems so plausible</p>

      <p>you guys are funny if you think wakeone is reserving their resources what they're doing with zb1 is literally their best they're known to sabotage THEIR OWN groups like this is rlly as good as it gets for them literally nothing shows that wakeone has a future for a new group besides their Frankenstein evnne zb1 mashup😭😭😭😭😭😭 like ur giving so much credit where it's not due wakeone just suck and they always will yall gotta accept it matthew said he foolishly thinks ab the future w his members how is this getting twisted

      <p>i think anon meant “gave up on plans for zb2” considering what they said after and zb1 has been ten times more successful than all their previous groups together, they brought them millions of dollars just from album sales and they had like 10000 different merch releases and multiple fancons, if wk1/cj wanted they could at least hire a few 18yo minimum wage employees to step up their socmed game 😭 idk i think it’s silly to compare them to any other groups under wk1 because financial gain wise zb1 has been like in the top 20 of the most successful kpop groups ever and other were midtier at best (kep1er)</p>

      <p>bro they're not hiring teens that's unheard of and also doesn't work and they'd have to do background check to make sure they don't hire fans 😭 I think wakeone is genuinely trying with zb1 it just fucking sucks but their biggest road block isn't even their promotion it's their Artist
