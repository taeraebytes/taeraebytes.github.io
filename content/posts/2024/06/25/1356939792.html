      <p>ricky and matthew are on the same floor cuz matthew was in ricky's live earlier in the living room. i know for sure gunwook doesnt share the same floor as them cuz he was commenting on ricky's live prob from the upper floor. who even said that haobin are on the lower floor that makes zero sense. they prob all stayed on their previous floor and i suspect that the managers stopped living with them so they got space idk.</p>

      <p>I thought that too extra space from the manager but that still wouldn't give them 8 rooms in total unless both floors had like a spare room that was being used as storage
