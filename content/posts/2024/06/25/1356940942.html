      <p>This duo is so fun now that Ricky bulked up. For me nothing is the same anymore, now Gyuvin can't force the female role onto Ricky. It feels like reading a chinese danmei where the bottom wants to top but ends up being the bottom. I need people to make gyuvin the bottom in this ship and for him to freak out and stop this yaoi shit.</p>
