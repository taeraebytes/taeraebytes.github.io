      <p>Girl someone use this on a fansign and let this shit be over. Like someone tell him omg gyuvin I feel like uri hao is so unfair to you, when he got angry he didn't talk to you for a long period of time but when he gets angry with Hanbin he says that he doesn't even last a day being angry with him. Isn't that super unfair ðŸ¥¹? Our poor Bambi.</p>

      <p>some of your anons are so mean how do you go days making fun of gyuvin just cuz you hate him being close to your fav? hao clearly likes him else he himself would have distance himself from gyuvin. you donâ€™t even know yet if they are on the same floor so probably stop tweaking until you have the correct fact? i really donâ€™t wanna say anything but these anons have been going on for days and i feel like i have to say something</p>
