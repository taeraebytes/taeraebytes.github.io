      <p>most probably hanbin, jelpi may want to make a group around gwk, would you like it if gwk starts acting, i suddenly remember sejeong, what if gwk goes the same way?

if gugudan are still together i might have seen xiening and gwk together in one place</p>

      <p>I would love to see gunwook act but like way later he needs to continue being an idol for at least 5 more years before he hops into acting if he ever does

      <p>Gunwook has the same amount of loyal fans or even more than sejeong does right now💀 She is lucky to have been popular when gp cared about survival shows but she doesn't have that fandom anymore</p>

      <p>Oh yeah, then go stream that cover the views are depressing and gunwook didn't even get the chaeaedol charity thing, he is not the member with the most impressive fandom organized ads or events, in korea he is bottom three in popularity.</p>
