      <p>most probably hanbin, jelpi may want to make a group around gwk, would you like it if gwk starts acting, i suddenly remember sejeong, what if gwk goes the same way?

if gugudan are still together i might have seen xiening and gwk together in one place</p>

      <p>I would love to see gunwook act but like way later he needs to continue being an idol for at least 5 more years before he hops into acting if he ever does

      <p>Gunwook has the same amount of loyal fans or even more than sejeong does right nowðŸ’€ She is lucky to have been popular when gp cared about survival shows but she doesn't have that fandom anymore</p>
