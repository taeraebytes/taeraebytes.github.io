      <p>seriously it kind of makes me mad. it feels like this group is made to promote yuehuaz, it really becoming so cliquey, last night ricky was mentioning yuehuaz so much, feels like only they have a future after this group ends, it makes me sad about hb, mt and gwk ( taerae will be okay, he has wakeonez and i don't care about jiwoong)</p>

      <p>bruh we need to bring back the strict produce group rules where you couldn't mention your old companies/future every 2 seconds. like i still remember there was a fancafe rule on IOIs fancafe that you couldn't mention any groups they were in ,e.g chaeyeon was in dia and ioi, let alone companies ðŸ˜­ can they invest in diaries</p>
