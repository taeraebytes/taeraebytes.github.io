      <p>so now that we know they got their own rooms, rooms deco for each member

jiwoong still aint living with them so idc

hao well we already know he got a bar table, chairs so hes prob gonna get a mini fridge for ez 3am alcohol access and to stash his durian so it doesnt reek in the community fridge and probably has a cabinet for his koreaboo needs with his collection of kpop albums

hanbin typical uni student dorm clean and everything has his place, I rmb members saying hes a clean freak or something but I also remember seeing their washroom and it was a mess so he probably has the appearance of a clean room but his closet is where he throws everything in

matthew weeb galore with figures, waifu figures and posters. cabinets with led lighting to show off his collection, a bunch of plushies and probably puts fanarts and letters from fans onto his wall, probably has the iconic ikea pegboard for it

taerae typical gamer room with computer on his desk not on the floor, 4 monitors, rgb lighting, headset stand and maybe even a pee bottle, sound proof padding around his room, guitar stand and mic for 3am vocal needs

ricky typical guy room, no deco, kinda messy but the mess has its own place kinda thing, probably has the iconic 'clothes chair' where u wear a shirt once but its not dirty enough to go in the laundry and not clean enough to put it back in your closet so you just throw it on a chair, charger for his ipad so he can watch all the dramas he wants, snack stash so he can stay in his room 24/7

gyuvin same as ricky but with decoration, displaying stuff he likes like that framed jersey of that korean soccer player and hanging it on his wall, a few stuff animals on his bed,  probably has a shoe collection cabinet to showcase cause hes a sneaker head and iphone clip on his bed for easy social media access even when he's tired so he can keep tabs on haobinz and write 3am poetry about them on bubble
 
gunwook well we know he has a desk and computer in his room but he's more of a casual gamer unlike taerae who is a wannabe game streamer so he doesnt have 4 monitors and rbg lighting. Just a 1 screen setup he can hook his mac onto and probably some music mixing stuff. pen and paper on deck for his 3am rapper inspirations, I can see him hanging a tupac poster sometime in the future

yujin kinda like ricky and gyuvin but with minimal deco and probably bought a cabinet to hide all his cbar gifts like his pink mic so that he can say wakeone lost it so he doesnt have to use it</p>

      <p>I see hao having that yea I feel like he'd have a bit of a colorful room

Yea that sounds ab right 

awwww that sounds like Matthew 

Yea taeraes set up is taking up majority of the room 

Ricky probably has a desk and then his shit is eeeeeverywhere and he most def got the clothes chairğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ 

I feel like gyuvin is a little more orderly than Ricky and ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

His room is probably super lightly decorated but he probably has some nice accents he puts in with time and his plushies + fan gifts

ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ yea I see that
