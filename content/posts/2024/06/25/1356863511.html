ㅎㅎㅎ

I didn't wake up in time today so Hao hyung is really upset at meㅋㅋㅋ

He was shouting at me and beat me up because I also went off key during the recording ㅋㅋㅋthis hyung seriously

Of course my lifeline sung hanbitna saved me by taking us to a cafe and buying us drinks so now we've already forgotten everything kekeke 

He bought me a mango milk tea❤️the best, most kindest person that exists

Yujin? Ah I went out with him today how did you know?

Anyways yn~ cherish your friends and buy them mango drinks too~</p>
