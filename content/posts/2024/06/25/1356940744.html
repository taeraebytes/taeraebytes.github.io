      <p>well idk about 4 but yuehua is definitely not letting go of hao and yujin, and tbh it really feels like wakeone is already on plans for zb2 all they care about rn is milk money from the group and not even promote them right, matthew said the members are talking about post disbandment, hanbin said he alr has plans after disbandment, the yuehuaz boom idk it just seems so plausible</p>

      <p>you guys are funny if you think wakeone is reserving their resources what they're doing with zb1 is literally their best they're known to sabotage THEIR OWN groups like this is rlly as good as it gets for them literally nothing shows that wakeone has a future for a new group besides their Frankenstein evnne zb1 mashupðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like ur giving so much credit where it's not due wakeone just suck and they always will yall gotta accept it matthew said he foolishly thinks ab the future w his members how is this getting twisted

      <p>alright then so I just told you but you guys talk about Kepler and don't even know what went down fr kepler was never going to be big it's unfortunate what happened but off rip there was a difference between zb1 and Kepler so why even compare ðŸ˜­ and yea I'm pretty certain because the rumor sparked from schizophrenia induced rosins so why would I even consider
