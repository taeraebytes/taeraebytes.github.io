      <p>seriously it kind of makes me mad. it feels like this group is made to promote yuehuaz, it really becoming so cliquey, last night ricky was mentioning yuehuaz so much, feels like only they have a future after this group ends, it makes me sad about hb, mt and gwk ( taerae will be okay, he has wakeonez and i don't care about jiwoong)</p>
