      <p>I saw this and the comments really made me angry, despite the fact that it's just a cheek kiss there's a clear intent behind sharing those types of video using all tags related to kpop and people in the comments just going yasss kingüòÇüè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüëÜwhile good for intl popularity really make me wonder if they're completely brainless, some people would kill themselves over things like this</p>

      <p>Cyber Libel will proceed whether your claim is false or truth. As long as it can ruin a life or a career. In Hao's case, spreading his predebut contents in the context of being gay is career-threatening, esp in homophobic South Korea.</p>
