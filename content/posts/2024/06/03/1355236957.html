      <p>Not sure which SF, but a private convo was leaked last night saying that they'll take photos of CRosins and spread them. So, an Uber rich Rosin who couldn't join decided to hire bodyguards to protect CRosins, on all sites because filming are in different sites. They will also serve as contact just in case CRosins need anything. CBar is supplying CRosins with food and other stuff.</p>
