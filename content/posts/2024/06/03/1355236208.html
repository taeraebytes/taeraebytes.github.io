      <p>i'm about to sound crazy but u know if zeroses are so desperate for this 'queer rep' which they're clearly not gonna get from a group based in korea where -5 celebrities are out and where actual activism for lgbt ppl is pretty dire then they can go stan dan and phil (YES in the year 2024 idgaf. zb1 are probably as cringe as them there's just a language barrier so it doesn't hit as hard) bc as someone who has casually been keeping up with them for years even after my pre-teen obsessive stanning ass fizzled out they fulfil those needs for them. i'm not gonna elaborate bc it'll take forever but just go on tumblr and scroll the active dan and phil blogs anon asks bc from all anyone there and on twitter talks about i've realised u can literally get all u want from zb1 by stanning fuckass dan and phil since their whole online persona is their relationship/bond/duo-ness while zb1's should majority be about performances, humour, GROUP bond and all that while shipping/'gay culture' should be one small aspect ðŸ˜­ i'm sure there are other newer and more relevant gay duos but idc about influencers ngl i'm stuck in 2015</p>

      <p>I think both a joke and a point I understand the tokenism aspect of Dan and Phil but also they are gay and actually dated? But the fan space aspect yea it's so similar to zeroses and how they operate
