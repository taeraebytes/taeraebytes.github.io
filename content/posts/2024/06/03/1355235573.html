      <p>yâ€™all complaining that zb1 only goes viral for being gay and thatâ€™s all zeroses talk about but how are we supposed to control if thatâ€™s what non fans engage with ðŸ˜­ zeroses DO hype up their talents like all the time we tried to promote the fuck out of their good encores after their first rocky one blew up BUT NO ONE OUTSIDE OF THE FANDOM ENGAGED LIKE ITS SO FRUSTRATING people only see them if they want to make fun of them like we are trying oh my god ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Both can be true at the same time ðŸ˜­ like hyping up ur favs is just customary to any fan space so when you have something like that paired with the only other thing zeroses talk about one will stick out to a non fan more but also non fans will hate just to hate. I never said ppl aren't trying but I'm in the fandom as well that's just my piece and this is cc girl it was an opinion I'm not a cop
