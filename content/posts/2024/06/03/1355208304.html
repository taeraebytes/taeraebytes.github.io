      <p>gw rap I liked it but mmm idk I was talking about this with my friends but he kind of has a unique flow where he takes inspo from older rappers LIKE 90s RAPPERS😭 which personally I don't like I guess I'm gonna have to get used to it tho but he's an amazing lyricist but unfortunately I'm always gonna have to wait for someone to break it down to me cuz I don't get it besides his English lyrics and uhhhh yea we're not shouting out ppl no more ok gunwook? He's a talent but I guess cuz I have a better ear than most I wasn't rlly that impressed compared to older stuff I rlly prefer those even his wild idol stuff over the seasons performance I feel like because he's not in a space where he can be creative constantly like before he's being stunted by the lack of care wakeone puts into rapping and it makes me sad cuz he wants to rap so bad🙁 But what cb mention??
