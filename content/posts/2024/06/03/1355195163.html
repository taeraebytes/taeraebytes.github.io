      <p>Regarding the alleged leaks of trade secrets, the court found it difficult to classify the information mhj shared like KakaoTalk conversationsas ADOR’s trade secrets or to prove any specific financial damage to ADOR caused by these leaks

The court also rejected HYBE’s claims that mhj actions in relation to stylist B, who was allegedly paid for services related to NewJeans’ advertisements, constituted breach of duty They found no evidence that ADOR suffered financial loss due to these actions
So the criminal charge that Hybe defender talking about leaks of trade secret and money emblazement also got denied by the court
And they keep talking about waiting for criminal charge by Hybe

So much talks forvHybe is saving their evidence for the court, just you wait</p>
