      <p>it's a lil weird how u and some of ur anons take it so personally whenever ppl anywhere call zb1 gay when it's just not that serious. gyubrik can't even show any affection towards each other without u screaming queerbait. why do u care? it's all just typical queer kpop twt antics. 99% of gyubrik fans don't actually think they're dating. also ranting abt fics not having an "accurate" portrayal of the members is so stupid. i'm sorry, but those are called fanFICTION for a reason. why read them at all if u expect them to be like real life? obv none of those members are having gay sex with each other in real life. ppl just wanna fantasize abt their favs being gay romeo and juliet in peace. rpstwt are not showing their shit down ur throat. u won't see it (esp the more sexual stuff), unless ur actively seeking it out. and to that one anon, ofc shippers will react negatively when u deliberately go into their spaces just to go umhm akstually those men like vaginas and ur weird for thinking otherwise haha checkmate! 🤓☝️like wow u really showed them huh. u don't have act like a knight in shining armor defending zb1's masculinity from some teen girls calling them breedable omegas on twitter. they will be fine, i promise 💀</p>

      <p>I could take rosins saying I'm obsessed with hao ...I could even take allins saying I'm obsessed with hanbin (sometimes) but this is too far and just wrong and the beggest accusation I've ever gotten BLOCKED.

      <p>“obsessed” when the whole fandom has built up zb1’s identity as shipping, gay, and queerbaiting since even BEFORE july 2023. so ur not allowed to talk about it?😭 omg they better stop trying u cause even nonfans i’ve seen complaining about how there’s more promotion of members random sexualities than talent for this KPOP GROUP. god im tired of zeroses acting like it’s homophobic too if one were to point out it’s kinda odd how almost nothing else is talked about for most of the boys, especially when it comes to the masses. tired of the same shit too the same word vomit in tweets talking about active queer participation, that’s a whole different topic though. very nice and cool if the boys are supportive of a fucking human right idk but i don’t wake up my day thinking about the boys actively fucking and sucking each other, instead i just wait for performances and personality first but some zeroses can’t say the same. the whole fandom is FUCKED. thank god i got the time and right to enjoy zb1 off twitter when all anyone does is be weird 😭 and ofc wakeone and zb1 tap into shit that they know gets them talked about or for the already established fans to freak out over. yeah sorry i went on a rant and it’s all over the place but ya idc im defending u requeefiem😂😂 ignore these braindeads</p>

      <p>Thank u queen like I shouldn't even let people who think zb1 participate in queer culture try to talk to me like do you even know anything about them outside of perceived personalities and imposing🤔? Wow I hate that this is dragging on I'm honestly cutting it here I'm not talking ab this anymore but I'm gonna need everyone to understand where they are.
