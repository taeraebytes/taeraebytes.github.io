      <p>it's a lil weird how u and some of ur anons take it so personally whenever ppl anywhere call zb1 gay when it's just not that serious. gyubrik can't even show any affection towards each other without u screaming queerbait. why do u care? it's all just typical queer kpop twt antics. 99% of gyubrik fans don't actually think they're dating. also ranting abt fics not having an "accurate" portrayal of the members is so stupid. i'm sorry, but those are called fanFICTION for a reason. why read them at all if u expect them to be like real life? obv none of those members are having gay sex with each other in real life. ppl just wanna fantasize abt their favs being gay romeo and juliet in peace. rpstwt are not showing their shit down ur throat. u won't see it (esp the more sexual stuff), unless ur actively seeking it out. and to that one anon, ofc shippers will react negatively when u deliberately go into their spaces just to go umhm akstually those men like vaginas and ur weird for thinking otherwise haha checkmate! ü§ì‚òùÔ∏èlike wow u really showed them huh. u don't have act like a knight in shining armor defending zb1's masculinity from some teen girls calling them breedable omegas on twitter. they will be fine, i promise üíÄ</p>
