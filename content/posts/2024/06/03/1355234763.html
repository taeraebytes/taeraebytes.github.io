      <p>one of the reasons why they also push the male gazey on Lesserafim and act like it doesn't happen with other groups it's bc there's a lot of girls who are mad as hell about Chaewon having a lot of male fans. The forum fangirls can't stand it and everything started when tbz sunwoo did that fancall on where he told a fan: omg you look like Chaewon you are so pretty!!! and then the fans started tweaking about it. They also got mad at Jungkook liking a lot of videos related to Chaewon.</p>

      <p>yeah sorry I know that Eric and sunwoo are like the messy ones so I mistaken them a lot of times lol. But yeah, since that day they don't let Chaewon breathe and it irks them that she's attractive to most males 😭</p>
