    "question": "all ggs are male gazey. even newjeans. the fact that those \"feminists\" think they're not because they're marketed as \"children\" fail to realize how pedophilic men are. there's a reason why there are so many male nj fans and why they're 4chan's and other incel forums fav gg. they literally call them pedobait. they LOVE hanni bc she's \"irl loli\". they love illit, too, for the same reason. sure some men do like it when ggs are dressed more provocatively and grown up, but what they love more is sexualizing something that is innocent/forbidden. they call mhj one of them because she knows what she is doing and I agree. she loves lolita, she had a naked pictures of lil girls on her wall. one of her leaked messages said \"people who look at braindead children\" when referring to fans. people were wrong when they accused her of being a pedo, she isn't. she is just a pimp. she gets off on men getting off on newjeans. they're many women like this. women who are fixated on girlhood and portraying it as sensual. sofia coppola is one of them. lana del ray too. the entire trend of \"coquette\" comes from a lolita passage and consists of bunch of girls who are into being raped by old men. in general grown women whose entire lives are about being a young girl usually have something wrong with them.",
    "reply": "yea idg the sentiment I think it's just to hate on lsfm like that's crazy that I'm even agreeing I hate lsfm but like you can't turn around and act like groups like new jeans aren't rlly either. There was scandal about cookie like did we forget that but essentially girl groups are unfortunately targeted and meant for male audiences like everything in their marketing prioritizes male audiences that's just how it is. But yes mhjs obsession with youth in girls is frightening but it's also just an age old norm that she's participating it's always been like this still weird tho. I guess it's easier to stan some girl groups tho like spectrum type shit some ggs are more \"male gazey\" than others UGH I HATE SAYING THIS EWüò≠ but I don't see the argument with new jeans and lsfm because they're both equal in it imo just two different approaches but that's not to say they can't have female audiences"

      <p>you would think those girls are rapists with the way public is treating them. i feel like in 2 years we will look back at this and be like "wtf was that? that's crazy" lmao. kside reminds be of the sulli hate train sm. many people don't remember but sullis hate train initially started as criticism for her lack of talent as well, saying that she has time to date and practice for her kdramas but not performances etc and it got only worse when she left after red light</p>

      <p>I feel esp sorry for eunchae, she brunts most of the hate for some stupid reasons. Literally theres 20k likes on a tweet by a korean ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù comparing her wearing offtheneck shoulder top and new jeans wearing baggy clothes, like its her fault. And high schoolers hate her. It defo reminds me of how other hate trains started off</p>
