      <p>loved gunwook's self written rap on the seasons but i cringed so bad at the chris brown line like bro we gotta take him away from these idols ðŸ˜­ usually i would ignore it bc so many of them have idolised him for years like it just seems to be a thing but a few days ago i was actually listening to a podcast episode about him and omg he's genuinely the devil's spawn??????????? bc i knew he did a lot but it was really A LOT like jesus christ</p>
