      <p>ok we have Astro anon (I recognize how they type and I've gotten other new anons that know astrology but it's getting harder to tell the difference)
Fashion anon now @chanelcrocs
#ggr anon now @imsonosy 
Blank anon 
geonihani anon
gunhao anon
bi tip anon
inverted knees anon 
sweet tooth anon 
embarrassed Ricky anon 
zb1 list anon 
there's this one anon that's sent smth in like 3 times but they always have a 3000 character message for me when they send smth 

There's ppl I know and remember but they've never identitified themselves or are frequent so I'm not gonna list but I think that's everyone I can identify off the top of my head
