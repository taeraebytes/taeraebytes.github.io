      <p>ok more info on the cbar thing. the money stealing seem to be true. we don't know how much, who and when it was stolen. but that burner acc seem to be using this issue as a way to take any ricky stans they don't like. for example, island is the biggest and thee og fansite but was included bc she was a co-founder of ricky cbar, not even an admit. she took pics of ricky when they were filming zb1 camp. back then all fansites who followed them were getting wacked left and right, her included, and that's where the stalking accusation comes from
