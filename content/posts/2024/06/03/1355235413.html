      <p>apparently even chinese ricky fans don't know who the cbar admit is. they don't have any public accs and just work behind the scenes. that person who made the burner was just trying to start shit accusing like 10 different people of being an admit for no reason. for what purpose? we don't know. but some ppl speculate that it may be a fan of other member trying to cause chaos before hariboz keep running shooting as a way to sabotage ricky gaining any more new fans. he has been growing like crazy for these past weeks, gaining new 5-10k fans everyday. wouldn't be the first time. they had successfully stifled his growth by clogging up his search results multiple times before x. com/mogu9090/status/1797442931386941620</p>
