      <p>you would think those girls are rapists with the way public is treating them. i feel like in 2 years we will look back at this and be like "wtf was that? that's crazy" lmao. kside reminds be of the sulli hate train sm. many people don't remember but sullis hate train initially started as criticism for her lack of talent as well, saying that she has time to date and practice for her kdramas but not performances etc and it got only worse when she left after red light</p>

      <p>I feel esp sorry for eunchae, she brunts most of the hate for some stupid reasons. Literally theres 20k likes on a tweet by a korean ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù comparing her wearing offtheneck shoulder top and new jeans wearing baggy clothes, like its her fault. And high schoolers hate her. It defo reminds me of how other hate trains started off</p>

      <p>like you have namjoon saying that he was depressed as hell, suho crying on every damn show bc of exo, clc seunghee crying on a whole variety show saying that her being the leader ruined some friendship's with other members and that's why they changed leaders.

and yet you have those akgaes fighting about leader title. they are not serious</p>

      <p>I remember in my old group the leader going on hiatus because he developed such bad panic disorder like I can‚Äôt understand why kpop stans want their bias to be the leader like I would never want that for my bias. Because ultimately, especially in lazier companies, most the responsibility for shit gets dumped on the leader they end up working the most hours sorting out shit, I guess in this case it does help that he‚Äôs the main dancer too because he‚Äôs also got the responsibilities with monitoring and leading practice. Idk I get why kpop groups have leaders but underneath that it just feels like a lazy way for companies to dump responsibility they feel beneath them onto a member and I‚Äôm sure anyone whose stanned groups before can attest the leader is usually the one whose seen going through it the most.</p>

      <p>when hanbin was announced as leader i was worried about this but i was also worried about if his whole personality would suddenly be made about how he's leader (before zb1 i was a big carat and literally all anyone would talk about with scoups was that he's leader like u ask them about a personality trait of his they'll just say he's the leader or even if they don't somehow it'll lead back to him being the leader LMAO) which is just corny and annoying but i guess a perk of being from a survival show is that he got to show his skills for a pretty long period before getting that leader title (actually wait now that i think about it if jiwoong was leader his whole personality would probably be that he's leader since he's not very skilled and ppl only ever talk about him being old) like i feel like he's known for dancing equally as much, if not more, and obviously he has the whole hamnyangi thing going on lmao? and maybe having lots of akgaes weirdly helps bc they don't care about the other members so they're not gonna care that much about him being a leader for them. although when shit happens and some zerose/anyone makes a shady comment about hanbin they do suddenly care and are like "you should be thankful for everything hanbin does as leader of the group" üò≠ i guess zb1 is a weird exception for all /that/ leader stuff</p>
