      <p>I saw this and the comments really made me angry, despite the fact that it's just a cheek kiss there's a clear intent behind sharing those types of video using all tags related to kpop and people in the comments just going yasss king😂🏳️‍🌈👆while good for intl popularity really make me wonder if they're completely brainless, some people would kill themselves over things like this</p>
