      <p>No this is the same thing with 311 like it's just a statement ðŸ˜­ ok let me list out why I don't believe the statement 

1. The original expose didn't come from the alleged girls but a GUY who's the CEO/Manager of a night club. He deleted the initial tweets but ofc everything got reposted and looking through his page he was just doing club promo. So already this didn't come from a jealous/angry fan or from the girls involved. I kind of think this guy is a bitter ex actuallyðŸ˜­

2. The pictures he exposed were ig story screenshots that I'm assuming are from a small private insta (wasnt a cf or anything). The @ was like _mx822 or smth and when I checked the ig was gone plus the second girls ig was gone as well. Only the doyoung fan remains but she turned off her comments. Me and lotus did more digging and we just wanted to confirm yea they're escorts we found the doyoung fans manager/pimp ðŸ˜­

3. The content of the initial expose. Ok so in the screenshots one of the story posts was the girl taking pictures of sasaengs waiting in front of the hotel basically saying "aw I feel bad for you guys you're out there but I just fucked them" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the other story posts were basically documenting the whole thing and saying smth in a similar tone but that one was just so funny to me

4. Sasaengs on twitter. These dummies gave it away someone found PUBLIC (surprising since jfans never share info) tweets from jssngs back in March kind of alluding to the whole thing. Grant it none of them were Johnny or haechan fans so the carelessness isn't that wild ig but there were convo screenshots talking about how they were seen out with these girls on more than one occasion. There was more to it but I was half paying attention ngl so I forgot some stuff 

5. Pretty much most of haechans jfans turned on him and started saying they want him to be kicked immediately and I even saw haechan kfans scrambling for a statement to be released. Johnny has none so no one cared but jungwoo and mark got tangled into the story and I was reading a jfans tweets right before I went to sleep and she was a former haechan fan that was mad af that was asking ppl to dm her info so she can connect it to the public ig. But she basically said mark and jungwoo were done too and then stuff about them came out like 6 hours later. The story there is a lot vaguer but it's said that Johnny mark haechan yuta jungwoo would just visit so many high end clubs and go right to the vip sections for the escorts ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Jungwoo is the most popular so obviously he'll get Grace but this is the guy that apparently went to hunting bars w sungchan it's all just so funny to me

There's more but that stuff could be fabricated and it just wasn't damning enough for me but these are just my points and because there's no hard core evidence you can always deny like unless there's a tape sm will say no and take legal action behind the scenes cuz I'm also sure those girls signed NDAs
