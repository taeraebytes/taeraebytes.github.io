      <p>He's being make fun of in China. They aren't used to men having that much make-up. He looks like the douyin girlies because of the eye makeup. I actually thought that he'll drop it because they're in a Chinese show and some makeup style for men are banned.</p>

      <p>Or, maybe Ricky likes it too... He should really chill with the aegyosal and lip lining. He's starting to look like those douyin girlies who frequent their plastic surgeon. He looks so good in his BP era. I actually thought he would blow up in China more than Hao because his face is like Dylan's and other CDrama actors. But he went the Douyin girlies path and I fear, he wants the makeup too. Although, it's difficult to tell him to change it since he's getting fans from it.</p>

      <p>He did his own makeup and it never looked like that... and he'd have to be mental to like this also idc if he likes it I DONT. But also he's not doing his makeup rn and it's not his choice so oh wellü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we gotta live with this new Ricky I guess the stylists are getting lit playing in his face
