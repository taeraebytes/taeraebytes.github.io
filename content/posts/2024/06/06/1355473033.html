      <p>Maybe it's too early for that kind of y2k but it's a mystery to me why girl groups nostalgia/2000s music formula (newjeans) worked so well and no bg jumped onto that. Imagine a group just bringing back Tvxq mirotic but with better bowl haircuts</p>

      <p>girl don't even play, the only similar thing with shinee is that shinee released view which is house music and riize has impossible which it's house music too. but concept wise, SHINee is miles ahead, they were risky, and were always bringing up something new to the table meanwhile riize has that skater instagram famous look/concept since debut.</p>
