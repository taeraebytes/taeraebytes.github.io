      <p>rosins trying hard to put cosmopolitan and the other four into the same level ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ cosmopolitan is considered new and fresh to the scene. it has more prestige over in europe and maybe the usa but not so much in korea. its acrually on the same level as allure. it doesnt really matter if jennie did some work for other covers because it doesnt raise their prestige, shes doing these covers for money or because her brand tells them to do them.</p>
