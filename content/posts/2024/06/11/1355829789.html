      <p>yeah theyre pretty even right now and depends on demographic. wonyoung is really popular with girls and her fanbase is almost entirely girls, shes really popular in korea, japan and fans from ioi where karina i'd say her fanbase is pretty even between female and male fans and shes popular in korea and china and has sm stans.

but ever since wonyoung went on that show with the 3 konglish dudes (iirc this is literally her first solo schedule since ive ðŸ’€) she got mad gp virality and gained some male fans too cuz they found out she actually had a personality and not just a pretty face and they really liked it. GIVE WONY SCHEDULES NOW !</p>
