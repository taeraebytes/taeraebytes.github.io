      <p>Waiting for passive aggressive comment spam under video  ðŸ˜­ 

"Hao Slays"

"Uri centre hao slaying so hard" considering that only 2 member will be performing 

"one thing about zhang hao is that he will always do justice and never ruin the essence of anygroup dance, from facial expressions to the smallest details of the choreo, he got it all covered"

"Hao visuals is no joke"</p>

      <p>nahhhh lets not rewrite history here i SPECIFCALLY remember that most of the comments in that geonihani tutting video were either zeroses and geonppangdans saying "omg main dancerz slayed" or corny allins being like "there is only ONE main dancer in zb1 how dare you say otherwise >:(" and them literally fighting anyone who called them both main dancers i remember because i was in those comments defending them for my life dont try to twist that shit</p>
