      <p>Hao saying that he pulled out 4 teeth (no wisdom teeth) and that made his face smaller but how does that work? Do they pull your teeth and then give you implants or?</p>

      <p>he's had braces so they probably extracted his teeth because he had a crowded mouth it's common if you get braces I almost got it done too

      <p>i saw people throwing a tantrum bc of this bc they assumed it was not for teeth heath/aesthetics but like a weird alternative for ps and damn this reminded me how dumb and dramatic a lot of kpop stans are üò≠ even if you never had braces he literally said it was a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù side effect</p>
