      <p>he gets away with shit because ppl think he is gay. Gay or straight, men are men and should be held to standards especially celebs.</p>

      <p>I'm the original op and no I do believe him being known as a gay man I'd obviously gonna change the perception of these types of interactions for valid reasons but I still think it was inappropriate because while its not that deep and was said in a clean manner it's inherently a sexual comment that personally would've rubbed me the wrong way coming from a stranger (yes you can joke like this w male friends esp gay male friends) but well we don't have the full complete interaction and the fan herself doesn't seem to have a problem with it so I won't speak for her, she could also be a regular so he knows her more</p>

      <p>I agree the perception does change in haos case I think you can have your opinions on it and like you said the fan doesn't seem to have issue and it was in a clean manner. that's why im not rlly taking issue and I generally don't have a negative or positive opinion I just don't care but I wanna prevent this from going somehwere weird but I can respect that
