      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean itâ€™s only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>

      <p>Maybe Iâ€™m just remembering wrong but as a whole I never remembered any of the past produce groups I stanned having as many solo or unit jobs as zb1 do. Even the po1, like it was majority whole group schedules and Iâ€™d say the solo stuff took offf after disbandment like I was a wizone and Iâ€™d actually disagree if you said wonyoung was getting premium treatment in terms of jobs because for things like variety ect it was mainly yena and yujin and aside from that they didnâ€™t do much that current zb1 members do. Even photoshoots like group ones were way more common that solo or units.</p>

      <p>Old ladies and men loved him and broduce was like. An enormous show like I don't think any current entertainment show in Korea compares to its impact, in 2017 kang Daniel was more famous than any BTS or exo membres and wanna one as a group could also rovalize with both, kpop fangirls thought always preferred jihoon and guanlin although Daniel still had a pretty big fan base esp with his big ships</p>

      <p>IoI and Wanna one were legitimately huge like everyone knew several members literally everyone watched those seasons im half Korean and me my mom and my sisters would tune in every week in 2016 2017 and call our cousins and everything to discuss each episodes they would immediately rivalize and dominate at debut with the biggest celebs of their gen (ioi with twice RV and bp although they had less time and wanna one w bts and exo) but what's crazy is that while their rivals are still relevant most of these ex produce stars aren't not even THE Kang Daniel is that relevant anymore, it just shows how much them as a group is what worked</p>
