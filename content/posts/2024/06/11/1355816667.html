      <p>My thoughts on all the other groups 
zb1: hao really good looking 95% of the time jiwoong good looking when he's not showing teeth hanbin good looking 93% of the time matthew wellll there are moments he's good looking ngl taerae on a good day very good looking on a bad day decent ricky really good looking without ridiculous make up gyuvin fluctuates a lot but can be good looking gunwook 100% time good looking but that haircut that was too short made him look a bit ridiculous but he's back now yujin 100% good looking face prince maknae

riize: i just said it 

tbz: juyeon sungwoo good looking altho sunwoo looking a bit strange these days changmin chanhee kevin cute in the twink way sangyeon manly handsome and everyone else is a chop

exo: ugh I don't even wanna talk about these grandpas the only contenders for me are kai baekhyun kyungsoo kai is cute ig baekhyun honestly not really cute twink ig and kyungsoo has all the right features but his height makes it hard to take him seriously suho kinda like a fat jin</p>
