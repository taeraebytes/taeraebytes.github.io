      <p>No group is getting mnet comeback shows every comeback lol. They are pretty exclusive that's why one of the prizes for the winner of queendom and kingdom was a comeback show.</p>

      <p>Boynextdoor got it three times and Xiikers did twiceðŸ’€ Pretty sure TWS will have one for their comeback too. The cons is that it is really long and tiring for artist and fans they are practically doing segments for 12-24 hours long and artists hate it , BTS said theyd never do it again. Wanna one actually tried to have one during the time they did their Mama comeback but the conditions were bad so they had to cancel.</p>
