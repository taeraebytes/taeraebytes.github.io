      <p>idk if ravi is on good terms with jellyfish but it would be kinda funny if the l1ve poached gunwook from jellyfish bc of the whole vixx connection. while typing this i remembered hanbin and gunwook had a mutual friend predebut too (kijung, in wild idol and i think he went to university with hanbin) wow i bet geonihani anon smiles about these 2 random ass connections daily</p>
