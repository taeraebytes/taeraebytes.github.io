      <p>op here tbh i only rewatched bp once and thats cause i was watching with my friend, its honestly diff and you get to reflect on moments that happened that in hidsight you may understand more. but you realise these shows are biased and a lot of the segments and not creative, esp with fhe planet series</p>

      <p>Not it was bp contestants!! They filmed the theme song way before the show even started, I was there!!! And I do think it was kinda shitty towards the ggroup tbh unlike the p48 theme song, but there was a double center highlight moment at least</p>

      <p>Even though people were calling them ugly tho(and the profiles they released after certainly didn't help) they loved taeraes reaction to junhyeons ending fairy this kinda was his very first launch at popularity 

Also when the shiny boys released some people shipped gyuvin and mjx and a lot of people wanted to see them together cause they visually match it's unfortunate that the execs were never interested in mjx

Also one of the trainees had possibly fake rumours of him having gonorreha and some insane sexts of his leaked like you had to be there 

Also haobin were shipped way before they ever interacted like people were more hyped by default by the prospect of haobin interacting than mattbin who were pushed in the first ep, there were very realistic edits made of them doing those pre shows challenges together for ex obviously I never expected them to get this big but it's interesting that people immediately saw the potential of this pair</p>
