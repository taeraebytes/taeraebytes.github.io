      <p>You people think "ms song" is the zb1 head manager you guys think she arranged the Gucci deal and you think her solo position of casting and management (mind u shes not even an exec) IS PULLING THESE STRINGSðŸ˜­ if hanbin becomes the mc of swf2 for whatever reason lets not act like the gig doesn't make sense that's his literal niche he's associated w the company that owns some of the rights, was in the dance field, and is an mc backed by cj like???? Don't tell me what I don't know why do u guys get shocked at the obvious. I just wish the group could get stuff as good as thw solo stuff hanbin gets like it's highly irking but it's not like any of this surprises me and it's not from some lady

      <p>rosins are so stupid with the song lady thing ðŸ˜­ hanbin gets jobs according to his skills and it isnâ€™t surprising even though it is quite annoying. He and Hao get the most. Like even  the music bank thing even though hao isnâ€™t part of the MC line in the group. Hao gets things both in Korea and China.</p>
