      <p>I feel like if the produce scandal hadn't happened he would still be pushed but not as heavily I mean his introduction in the first episode was legitimately ridiculous ðŸ˜­ I was actually thinking recently that only hao would've made it as a foreigner and gyujin would be top 2 if we followed produce formulz</p>

      <p>I never watched any of the produce series so I couldn't say but 100% even the bp producers had no interest in Ricky ðŸ˜­ but majority of the group would've still made it since they were all producer picks

      <p>op here tbh i only rewatched bp once and thats cause i was watching with my friend, its honestly diff and you get to reflect on moments that happened that in hidsight you may understand more. but you realise these shows are biased and a lot of the segments and not creative, esp with fhe planet series</p>

      <p>My conspiracy theory has always been that they wanted Matthew to be the other center cause if they wanted to push the haobin narrative from the beginning they wouldve frames the two first episodes completely differently, they were obviously fine with hao getting center tho cause that's their golden boy but yeah I'll never forget Matthew getting the visual vote let's BFFR</p>

      <p>Love Matthew but them putting him as a shiny boy was ridiculous like if they wanted a Korean kamden would've been more believable ðŸ˜­not even his bff Hanbin even CONSIDERED him that spot should've gone to hao, Ricky, shuaibo or jinxin</p>
