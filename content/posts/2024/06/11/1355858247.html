      <p>i truly think that our akgae problem is so bad because alot of these people stan their bias because they hate hao/hanbin. stanning the other makes it easy for them go hate the other. they obviously keep up with the member they hate, it looks like obsession and alot of token stanning to me</p>

      <p>It is a lot of token stanning they're rivals and fighting for the number 1 spot it's just participating in a war for who can be better
