      <p>This is random but I've been wondering since the NCT mess made me realise jfans are messy as fuck too lol how are jaeroses as a whole and what do they think about the big scandals like the jiwoong one or things like all the gyuvin micro scandals or hao being gay or yujin gf etc</p>

      <p>jfans are messy but they keep info to themselves irs very rare they release stuff and when they do they're mad that pretty much goes for all jfans. jzeroses are no different I guess but they're also generally very sweet and supportive and love the group a lot
