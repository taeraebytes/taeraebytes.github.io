      <p>rosins need to stop putting words into haos mouth. he was saying he is wk1 prince, zb1 prince obviously being cj prince would be next. he joked because that would never happen because cj is just too big of a company. the person most likely to be cj prince is wk1 prince (=hao). he was just joking around but rosins seem keen set on trying to set him up ðŸ˜‘</p>
