      <p>In my opinion i dont think the members are convincing that they are pulling off the concept well. Gag was too generic to judge, but Love 119 and Impossible are good songs but songs that i think are a shame they went to Riize. They dont understand the concept, stage presence is horrible minus a few. I think Talk Saxy was their best in that area.</p>

      <p>yea I said before they're pretty auraless in terms of performance I think wonbin sungchan and shotaro are  good but they all have different approaches to the same concept

      <p>Sorry to talk about performance again but I think one big thing about riize and why they feel a bit empty and bland (I saw them irl, sometimes performers are stronger on camera than irl and vice versa but in riizes case they were just as "meh" irl) is because they strongly lack group chemistry, most am idols aren't good on facial expressions which is fine you can still be a strong performer without it (ex Karina, Irene) but for them it's like they're not trying to embody the song or aren't feeling it and doesn't seem to have any chemistry as a group (twice are a great example of having some weak performers but GREAT group chemistry on stage) I think singing live loudly would help and maybe trying to give them a more challenging song performance wise that has less complex xhoreo like a super bright song or a very sad one that would force them to actually perform</p>

      <p>It's cool lol I've seen riize twice and they're pretty basic like they can dance and perform fine but there's nothing rlly enticing about them. Ngl I walked out when I saw them the first time ðŸ˜­ but hmmmm I feel like it is the chemistry thing and that too it's like they're not rlly on the same page talk saxy was definitely their best I think every member embodied it and it was by farrrr their best I saw live then it was the impossible bridge wonbin and sungchan rlly captivated me but that was it I think they can grow to be rlly good but they're just not selling it rn

      <p>Oop and I disagree I know a lot of people hater ger but Wendy is a STRONG performer! and the best in the group, Seulgi is good and Irene is great at sensual and classy performances which is half of their discography they don't have strong chores but they can perform!</p>
