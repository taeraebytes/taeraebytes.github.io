      <p>Aespa aren't good dancers as a whole which is fine considering that's not their focus but I'm not sure how anyone actually interested in dancing would rate Karina seriously she's an alright idol dancer, she is and has always been, the best performer of the group tho</p>

      <p>I mean sm was also setting them up with their previous choreos. They had a lot of locking and popping moves and you add that to the fact that aespa has weak dancers and you get the mess that savage and girls was.</p>
