      <p>The difference is killling me cause didnâ€™t gyuvin and Gunwook had back to back gigs not even a month ago. For gyuvin, he mced with yujin for a show (I forgot the name), then Atkinson, then the baseball gig, then music core mc all this while being the dozen of the group 

For gunwook, he got dingo, kcon japan mc, Atkinson, music core mc, baseball gig ALL of these were announced literally back to back that too in cb era which means wakeone was handing out gigs to these 2 specifically 

So suddenly why is tere such a difference in reaction when we all know damn well that hanbin is the most suited member for mcing iland and being on aotm like why are we even surprised ? Itâ€™s like you guys would rather see people from other groups get the gig than the member from your own group who IS THE BEST SUITED FOR these gigs. 

Also how is it back to September when literally every member except Jiwoong has gigs rn ? And hanbin isnâ€™t even the one with the most gigs.</p>

      <p>They got them back to back while there was other active promotion and a baseball game isn't even close to the prestige of aotm or iland mcing are u stupid I literally said I don't rlly feel anything ab it the timing just sucks since we know it's going to be dead till the next cb likejfndndmmdmdmðŸ˜­

      <p>That baseball game is good in Korea wdym just because Gunwook and Gyuvin didnâ€™t make noise doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t anything, and like i said mcing and aotm was bound to be given to Hanbin since he is quite literally the best member in the group for it ? Gunwook also got thelive request so what now, the way you guys turn negative every time a hanbin gig is announced is appalling ? And rosins tweaking saying hao has not had a solo job ever is killing me isnâ€™t he the one with literally the most jobs and he want gonna get aotm anyway he isnâ€™t even dance line</p>

      <p>when did I say they didn't make noise like u can argue but don't put words in my mouth it's annoying but ur crazy if u think a baseball game is comparable to AOTM... I never said it shouldn't have went to hanbin like idk what ur so upset at me for I commented on the timing once and said it was obviously going to hanbin and kept it pushing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like who are u arguing with????
