      <p>Oh girl it's a mess they did a 27 min video trying to debunk the plagiarism claims but it was incredibly unprofessional and was extremely badly received 
For ex they had screenshots that were visibly from dcgal ðŸ˜­
They brought back the mexican gg newjeans plagiarism accusations (the gg recently showed love to nj and it's weird to do in general)
They tried to claim a nj choreo that was released before love me like this plagiarized it
They tried to claim nj took from bp aiyl uniform concept which yg ex artistic director publicly disagreed with 
They called bp concept untouchable, I've concept dolls and nj concept pedobait basically ðŸ˜­ they're DONE</p>
