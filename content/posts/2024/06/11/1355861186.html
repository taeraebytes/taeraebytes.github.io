      <p>idk if ravi is on good terms with jellyfish but it would be kinda funny if the l1ve poached gunwook from jellyfish bc of the whole vixx connection. while typing this i remembered hanbin and gunwook had a mutual friend predebut too (kijung, in wild idol and i think he went to university with hanbin) wow i bet geonihani anon smiles about these 2 random ass connections daily</p>

      <p>yeah i kinda share a similar opinion, also it's kinda obvious that the l1ve probably won't let hanbin focus on singing and they want him doing other things too but i don't want that for gunwook.</p>
