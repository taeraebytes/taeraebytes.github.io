      <p>I feel like if the produce scandal hadn't happened he would still be pushed but not as heavily I mean his introduction in the first episode was legitimately ridiculous ðŸ˜­ I was actually thinking recently that only hao would've made it as a foreigner and gyujin would be top 2 if we followed produce formulz</p>

      <p>I never watched any of the produce series so I couldn't say but 100% even the bp producers had no interest in Ricky ðŸ˜­ but majority of the group would've still made it since they were all producer picks
