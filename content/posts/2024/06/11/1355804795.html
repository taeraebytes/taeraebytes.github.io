      <p>The difference is killling me cause didn’t gyuvin and Gunwook had back to back gigs not even a month ago. For gyuvin, he mced with yujin for a show (I forgot the name), then Atkinson, then the baseball gig, then music core mc all this while being the dozen of the group 

For gunwook, he got dingo, kcon japan mc, Atkinson, music core mc, baseball gig ALL of these were announced literally back to back that too in cb era which means wakeone was handing out gigs to these 2 specifically 

So suddenly why is tere such a difference in reaction when we all know damn well that hanbin is the most suited member for mcing iland and being on aotm like why are we even surprised ? It’s like you guys would rather see people from other groups get the gig than the member from your own group who IS THE BEST SUITED FOR these gigs. 

Also how is it back to September when literally every member except Jiwoong has gigs rn ? And hanbin isn’t even the one with the most gigs.</p>

      <p>They got them back to back while there was other active promotion and a baseball game isn't even close to the prestige of aotm or iland mcing are u stupid I literally said I don't rlly feel anything ab it the timing just sucks since we know it's going to be dead till the next cb likejfndndmmdmdm😭

      <p>That baseball game is good in Korea wdym just because Gunwook and Gyuvin didn’t make noise doesn’t mean it isn’t anything, and like i said mcing and aotm was bound to be given to Hanbin since he is quite literally the best member in the group for it ? Gunwook also got thelive request so what now, the way you guys turn negative every time a hanbin gig is announced is appalling ? And rosins tweaking saying hao has not had a solo job ever is killing me isn’t he the one with literally the most jobs and he want gonna get aotm anyway he isn’t even dance line</p>

      <p>when did I say they didn't make noise like u can argue but don't put words in my mouth it's annoying but ur crazy if u think a baseball game is comparable to AOTM... I never said it shouldn't have went to hanbin like idk what ur so upset at me for I commented on the timing once and said it was obviously going to hanbin and kept it pushing 😭😭😭 like who are u arguing with????

      <p>Anon a lot of people are annoyed because like queef said the timing sucks. it is the second time he is hogging the activities when the cb promo is over and the rest of the members are nowhere to be seen. Its also annoying that all the gigs are from mnet/cj so you know they can pull gigs for the others as well but they aren't doing that in this break. Literally that is all like wbk if anyone from zb1 gets an aotm, its gonna be hanbin first but like I said earlier the timing just sucks. It's just him having gigs announced back to back while its silence for the whole group, they are not doing lives to compensate either so there is literally nothing to watch or talk about and also when have rosins asked for aotm? Just saying anything</p>

      <p>you guys always act like where were rosins saying this bla bla but your akgaes were really going out there and talking about how Hao should’ve been on aotm since he’s the best performer 😭 sorry there is a huge line before him he wouldn’t even be the second choice for aotm in zb1 itself. And yes, the timing could’ve been better cause the one who gets hate from the timing is hanbin himself like everyone got ost but Hanbin’s was the only one treated like shit because of the timing so was his mc job received really badly compared to yujins but there’s nothing that can be done. And like I said I would get if some other sf would be mad about lack of schedules but you are mad saying nobody has any schedule when Hao just got done shooting keep running in China and it hasn’t even been 2 days in Korea and he’s off to another schedule with yujin which seems like a big one, so he’s not jobless. 
i just said how everything was so negative all of a sudden regardless of the timing or whatever like did you guys really prefer someone from bnd to go to aotm over hanbin is what I was wondering. But whatever atleast ot9 zeroses were not negative on my tl this time so i got better after that.</p>

      <p>I think I'd rather choke than bnd YUCK don't even say that.... but I had no opinion for that cc tbh but I get it timing doesn't serve hanbin well but it's also just the fact that he's always first and it's during hiatuses just so unbalanced and I can't say that it's not upsetting or annoying. But for me it was more so the chances were a bit higher and I've been thru smth like this before w my old bias like sorry im an unc the ptsd was kicking 🤷‍♀️ but I alr addressed that point someone posted the amt of gigs each member got but eh idrc ab this anymore tbh
