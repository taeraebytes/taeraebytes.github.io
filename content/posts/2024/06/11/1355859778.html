      <p>i think that the rumors are about milan fashion week. gucci is on the 17th. that would be exactly one week from now. hanbin also mentioned that some great news will be released. if haos schedule had something to do with zeronis, i doubt that the news would be about him. i didnt watch his live so i cant confirm. the only thing that genuinely matters is that jiwoong isnt the one getting stuff.</p>
