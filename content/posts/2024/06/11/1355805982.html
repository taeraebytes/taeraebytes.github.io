      <p>i know waacking and tutting is his thing and people want to see it because they can talk about him being "the only professional dancer in kpop" but i feel like the waacking/tutting choreo we usually see just relies on the novelty of the style and i dont really trust AOTM to do anything truly interesting with it...</p>
