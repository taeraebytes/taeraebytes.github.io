      <p>I feel like if the produce scandal hadn't happened he would still be pushed but not as heavily I mean his introduction in the first episode was legitimately ridiculous ðŸ˜­ I was actually thinking recently that only hao would've made it as a foreigner and gyujin would be top 2 if we followed produce formulz</p>

      <p>I never watched any of the produce series so I couldn't say but 100% even the bp producers had no interest in Ricky ðŸ˜­ but majority of the group would've still made it since they were all producer picks

      <p>Wonyoung wasn't actually the it girl during produce and Izone. It was Sakura. Wonyoung got her crown in Ive, but has to share it with Yujin coz gp prefers her fun personality. For them, yujin approachable and Wonyoung isn't. Yeah, I agree. Queens shouldn't be reachable by mere mortals</p>

      <p>Yujin is like a cash cow for Starship she genuienly has more prestigious cf than Wonyoung and other female idols. And variety PD love her she has good connection, Wonyoung has potential for variety but her image is too strong</p>
