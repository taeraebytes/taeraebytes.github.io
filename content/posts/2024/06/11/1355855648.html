      <p>I acc think Matthew seems way more nice/caring than Gyuvin does (like heâ€™s usually portrayed/perceived to be).. Gyuvin is obviously a very nice guy w no seriously bad intentions but Matthew seems like a more sincere genuine guy and less manipulative than Gyuvin. Like the way he talks to fans at fansigns and heâ€™s never ignored a single member idk itâ€™s rlly sweetðŸ˜£</p>
