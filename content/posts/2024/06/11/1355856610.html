      <p>brah with the way these people act everytime a member says something especially hanbin or hao i feel so bad for how many people will twist their words to start something like this shit is crazy... everything is shade and conspiracy theories I've been in 3 kpop fandoms before and it was never this bad and they had worse akgaes like omg</p>
