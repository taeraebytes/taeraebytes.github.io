      <p>maybe i'm sensitive to it bc i ult him but i think hanbin getting the mc gig and aotm is very well deserved but i guess i get where ppl here are coming from ðŸ˜­ idk i think the problem is with wakeone in that solo/unit stuff is STILL prioritised more than ot9 stuff (there also wasn't mmtg/radio shows/relay dances/mv reaction/other usual (or hinted in the case of mmtg) comeback stuff so that doesn't help) like howwwwwwwww have they not learned by now? i find they're actually very 'good' (i don't wanna compliment them lmao) when it comes to listening to feedback but with THIS they haven't.... is not a single person demanding ot9 stuff and everyone's just fine with everything being solo and all this division? like no one cares?????</p>

      <p>But no one watches group content? itâ€™s boring. Their views have only dropped. Zb1 does not have that pizzaz to be a variety group.</p>
