      <p>maybe i'm sensitive to it bc i ult him but i think hanbin getting the mc gig and aotm is very well deserved but i guess i get where ppl here are coming from ðŸ˜­ idk i think the problem is with wakeone in that solo/unit stuff is STILL prioritised more than ot9 stuff (there also wasn't mmtg/radio shows/relay dances/mv reaction/other usual (or hinted in the case of mmtg) comeback stuff so that doesn't help) like howwwwwwwww have they not learned by now? i find they're actually very 'good' (i don't wanna compliment them lmao) when it comes to listening to feedback but with THIS they haven't.... is not a single person demanding ot9 stuff and everyone's just fine with everything being solo and all this division? like no one cares?????</p>

      <p>what's making most people tweak is the announcment of these big solo gigs literally back to back that only benefit him while the other members get to do schedules during comeback to promote the group and allins theyre even remotely comparable like sorry idrc about all this that much but you're delusional if you dont see how cj is trying to build his career post disbandment + they need to stop speaking on the other members saying it's not hanbin's fault they have no demand like the demand in question is just mnet giving him thee things lmao</p>

      <p>The gigs just aren't comparable and I'd rather all solo work be halted if it meant group stuff was given that same level of care
