      <p>well too bad matthew ainâ€™t living in one dorm with hanbin so itâ€™s natural for them to grow a little apart but the thing is i never heard matthew visiting the upper dorm while i have heard gyuvin did multiple times so i guess try harder matthew?</p>

      <p>ok but i saw some fancall on where they ask matthew which members had the best chemistry and he was like me and gunwook and hanbin and hao and he said that hao and hanbin bc they were super touchy but the fuck ass person who uploaded only added the haobin part to their caption and that's the only thing i could translate but i wanted to see his reasoning on him and gunwook like ughhhh give me the mattparkz pill now.</p>
