      <p>Im the tarot reader and for context I get some negative feelings from literally any Hanbin reading whether it's about career or people outside of the group I think it's because he's in a bad place so he has a hard time being positive but for relationships I did get that mattbin were drifting away and were more bitter compared to the other Hanbin relationship readings I did like if I didn't know they were best friends I would've thought they just had a coworker relationship 
I also did gunwook gyuvin and they seemed to have a fight that hurt them both but are cool and for gunwook hanni I got nothing</p>

      <p>I mean he's kind of destructive? So no surprise but he'll make up with everyone if that's the case
