      <p>well too bad matthew ain‚Äôt living in one dorm with hanbin so it‚Äôs natural for them to grow a little apart but the thing is i never heard matthew visiting the upper dorm while i have heard gyuvin did multiple times so i guess try harder matthew?</p>

      <p>unlike gyuvin matthew doesn't need to mention other members 24/7 just to prove he's close to them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è he rarely mentioned them in his lives unless fans asked him but we have hanbin being emotional while talking abt him so</p>
