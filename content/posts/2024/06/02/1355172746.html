      <p>you would think those girls are rapists with the way public is treating them. i feel like in 2 years we will look back at this and be like "wtf was that? that's crazy" lmao. kside reminds be of the sulli hate train sm. many people don't remember but sullis hate train initially started as criticism for her lack of talent as well, saying that she has time to date and practice for her kdramas but not performances etc and it got only worse when she left after red light</p>

      <p>I feel esp sorry for eunchae, she brunts most of the hate for some stupid reasons. Literally theres 20k likes on a tweet by a korean ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù comparing her wearing offtheneck shoulder top and new jeans wearing baggy clothes, like its her fault. And high schoolers hate her. It defo reminds me of how other hate trains started off</p>
