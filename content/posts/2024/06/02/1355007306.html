      <p>i’ve never gotten the whole babygirl characterization of ricky tbh it feels weirdly infantilizing and doesn’t fit him at all (and yeah i know zeroses do it for most members but it feels especially over the top and out of place for ricky idk)</p>

      <p>It is over the top for Ricky you ask a riyangi to name 3 facts about him outside of the fact that he likes strawberries, boba, and journaling w stickers and they'll blank
