      <p>I think it's funny that people are talking about mattbin drifting away I made a tarot reading for a friend some weeks ago and I could feel it and I could feel negative feelings on Hanbin side especially (tbf I generally get more negative cards from Hanbin) I didn't have the heart to tell my friend I had to brautify it a lot aha</p>
