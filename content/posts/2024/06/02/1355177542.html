      <p>Ok I doubt that it's something serious or not another inside joke but I wonder why members keep "exposing" hb lately for not playing with them. First matt, gyu agreeing then yj saying the same on the seasons show</p>

      <p>Actually consider Matthew said this at a fansign the other day it‚Äôs made me look at it in a diffrent light

 I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs had a lot of responsibilities or pressure recently because when we look at vlog content like Japan trip he does seem quite playful with them and Mattbin were seen hanbin out loads around the same time</p>

      <p>Mmmmm I guess he's going thru stuff and also roles that come pressure and stress really can change/mold you and he's young so I guess he can't have fun as often as he used to but I guess it's a recent thing if other members beside Matthew are bringing it up

      <p>This is why when the girlies were fighting about Jiwoong, Hao or Hanbin being the leaders I was like mhm... Why would you want to put your bias on that position? Being a leader in kpop is hell, when a member fucks up the company don't just scold that member but also scolds the leader. If a comeback didn't reach the results they wanted, the company goes to the leader.</p>
