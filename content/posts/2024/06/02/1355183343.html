      <p>just remembered there was that anon earlier who said gyuvin has postype but never elaborated but i was curious so searched around. in the kode video with san they share their home screen and in gyuvin's 'kakao' folder there seems to be an app with the postype logo (i googled since i didn't know what it looked like but it's the black one with white 'tp' text in the middle). idk if that app is only for fics tho, i feel like i've seen ppl use it for other things like writing in general and even non-writing stuff</p>

      <p>I've only ever known postype to be for fan spaces where a lot of different things are created but you'd need to be looking at fandom stuff no?

      <p>Postype is mainly fanfiction, but yes you can find other types of works there. E.g guides, some blog posts. But its like 60% BL work 30% Kpop works 10% everything else. If someone in korea sees ur on Postype u can gurantee they are a BL reader or kpop fan</p>
