      <p>are zeroses gonna be this embarrassing the whole pride month i know most of them are like 14 and doing gay jokes cause no harm but these people get so upset if you dont want gyuvin to be your bisexual king, i thought it was just for the laughs which is fine cuz every fandom jokes about their faves being gay but this people would genuinely get MAD at other gay people if they think different from them, im not against shipping or anything i think its fun every fandom has shippers and i'm surprised zeroses outside the rps spaces are so against it  but at the same time wanna tweet about how gay the members are with each other but hey they're not like those "nasty ass shippers", just want it to get this out of my chest like im a zerose but im also a gay woman, there's no need to prove any of the members are super gay or super straight or whatever labelling y'all are doing cuz there's already artists that have come out as part of the lgbt community that you can support if what y'all care about its supporting actual gay people, its fine to call your faves gay or make jokes about it but there's no reason to get upset at people who might think different at the end of the day stanning kpop idols isnt gay activism and that's fine too</p>

      <p>wow how did you say that first sentence and not have your answer YES ZEROSES WILL BE EMBARRASSING AND INSUFFERABLE DURING PRIDE MONTH like they enjoy imposing sexualities and new personalities on the members especially the obviously straight members AND GYUVINðŸ˜­ it just makes me wonder what they enjoy more that or actually stanning the group idk like maybe let's try supporting actually out queer artists but no one wants to do that
