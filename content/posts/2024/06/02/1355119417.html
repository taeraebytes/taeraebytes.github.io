He's a talent but I guess cuz I have a better ear than most I wasn't rlly that impressed compared to older stuff I rlly prefer those even his wild idol stuff over the seasons performance I feel like because he's not in a space where he can be creative constantly like before he's being stunted by the lack of care wakeone puts into rapping and it makes me sad cuz he wants to rap so bad🙁 But what cb mention??"
