      <p>you would think those girls are rapists with the way public is treating them. i feel like in 2 years we will look back at this and be like "wtf was that? that's crazy" lmao. kside reminds be of the sulli hate train sm. many people don't remember but sullis hate train initially started as criticism for her lack of talent as well, saying that she has time to date and practice for her kdramas but not performances etc and it got only worse when she left after red light</p>

      <p>They'll be fine. There are 2 Japanese and one Western-minded members who dgaf on general with how the gp view them and their talent. The fact that Eunchae is still MCing in the biggest national broadcast means that they're fine. Hybe can just payola their digitals then sajaegi their album sales and GP would think that there are still a lot of Koreans that support them. The hate will die down eventually. Hybe is good in PR.
