      <p>tip for learning korean watch a lot of korean youtube and variety shows, not anything involving ent industry like kpop but shows where they are doing activities , vlogs. it really helps i genuinely learnt korean just by watching korea variety shows for a year or so.</p>

      <p>first i watched korean varietys from kshow123 a lot since 2018, it really helped the most since they are using phrases people use in day to day life, but the cons are they might be a little annoying to watch. i recommend earth arcade, i live alone (watch the eps of celebs u like that are on), the sixth sense. also dating shows are good, just be kind of concious especially with the korean subs. try and make links and think about common words you hear a lot, and it will eventually make more and more sense. on youtube it really depends bc theres a lot of various vloggers; if you search 브이로그 you see various videos but i wouldnt be hung up on it cause im not watching some korean girl do makeup for 20mins for the sake of itjsnewfen mimiminu is a funny one no eng subs but he revolves around education/studying but with humor (he retook the csat 7 times). i hoped this helped !</p>
