 i feel like ricky stands out between yuehuaz a lot and not in a good wayðŸ˜­ the other three look kinda similar and they have really small heads so they match well but for ricky apart from his big head hes face shape is very different i feel like out of all the members he has the best visual chemistry w jiwoong imo
