      <p>I dont follow the kside so did kgpd's ever complain about Gunwook bulking/ working out or gotten too bulky? I feel like with his proportions it's way better to be lean bulky instead of just straight up lean twig</p>

      <p>gunwook never got bulky tho like this is him with barely any muscle he's just broad and no they're not complaining they're actually going extra crazy over his body rn but they hate when he wears sleeveless

      <p>Whyy I feel like that fits him very well.. also gunwook was marketed as a strong big guy with gap Moe from the get go it'd make no sense for his fans to complain unlike Matthew lol</p>

      <p>it's funny like now he has decent biceps and I think he does a lot of chest exercises but that's rlly all he has gyuvin jiwoong matthrw all have bigger biceps than him ðŸ˜­ but yea it would be weird if his fans hated it like he's always just had a nice athletic build lean muscle suits him and idt he'd bulk he likes being skinny

      <p>actually i noticed that gyuvin lost some muscle. he said they appeared too large on camera so he probably stopped lifting as much.</p>
