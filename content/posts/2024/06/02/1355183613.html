      <p>"Twink is gay slang for a man who is usually (but not always) in his late teens to twenties whose traits may include a slim to average physique, a youthful appearance, little or no body hair, and flamboyancy." Wikipedia 

He's 20, slim, youthful in appearance, and has little to no body hair. The only thing missing is the flamboyancy, but that's not a necessity.¬†

Hao's a twink, so are Taerae, Gyuvin, Ricky and maybe Hanbin (all not bulky enough)

Jiwoong, Gunwook and Matthew are twunks¬†

and the term "Twink" can be applied to straight men as well. Tho mostly with a negative connotation</p>
