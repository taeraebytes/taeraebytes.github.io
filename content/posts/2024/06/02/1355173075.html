      <p>I'll be real to you... I kinda believe the Eunseo one and imo they broke up already but my conclusion is that the only idol he ever dated was her and since WJSN is not a big group nobody clocked that. But after that I think he just dates non celebs, and he gives me the vibes to date chaebols or overall just women with money. In my head he doesn't go to your normal ice skating dates/shopping mall dates/Korean bbq dates that makes those idols get caught, my head canon for him is that he goes to those expensive ass places that have private spots for loaded people.</p>
