      <p>no she actually complained about wakeone's incompetency so in mcountdown MC live just now hanbin mentioned that there are ghost stories in wakeone which used to be a training center for treasure. she was like "wakeone could have had the boys do live in the vocal room or training room telling ghost stories, they still have a long way to go they didn't even have the boys do any group live. these boys are limited on time and they only did solo live and that too are limited to subscribers. it's ridiculous that a live with members are even considered so important (that we kinda have to request) and nowadays there are likely none. isn't it idol-like live to have one member starts a live in the practice room then one member joins in and another joins after so it becomes a 3-people live? it's so f* expensive (to see idol's live)" honestly very valid complaint we have been saying this for a while.. they lack group lives!!!</p>
