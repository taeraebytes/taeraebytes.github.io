      <p>I think the issue here is Hao and Ricky being under Chinese yuehua. Chinese yuehua couldn't care less about Yena staying or not bc she can't do business in china anyways.</p>

      <p>All of yuehuaz sign under Yuehua, not YH Kr or YH Ch. All chinese trainee will train in korea and debut in korea/china because there's no training class in China. That's why Yuehua C-artist know how to speak korean and Yuehua K-Artist still promoted by Yh China</p>
