      <p>I get why not everyone is into Karina she does look very plastic but she's fine as hell to me especially with edgier styling and shorter hair it's not as obvious it's Giselle imo whose face changes too much who bothers me more</p>

      <p>Giselle is so bad now she's one of my favorites I get ppl finding karina crazy gorgeous and the other argument as well but i think it's cuz she's like an uncommon snake type but winters rllt been doing it for me recently
