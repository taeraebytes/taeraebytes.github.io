      <p>AGREE! I think one of the reasons tbz blew up a lot was because they literally went live every other day for hours and just tweaked in front of the camera. like it's so important for fan connection and creates so much lore and vitality you feel like you're actively part of something, like I'm so involved in zb1 but I feel like my cc is the only thing that keeps me connected it's so bad everything is separate and behind paywalls

      <p>I think, we should bring this now to the members since they will affected by this anyway. Those who subscribed on their plus chat should talk about this. I'll be doing this to Hao too. Maybe, as a group, they can discuss this to Wakeone. UNSCRIPTED lives and without fucking staff monitoring them. Let them be naturally funny.</p>

      <p>Definitely people should contact the global fanvases about this this is actually a big issue I'm not joking group lives should NOT be a rare scheduled occurrence it's PRIMORDIAL for us to have more lives for the success of the group</p>
