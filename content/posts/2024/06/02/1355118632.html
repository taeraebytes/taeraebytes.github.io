      <p>Viki got updated and thereâ€™s 6 episodes left of iland so 6 more weeks but whatâ€™s more interesting is that usually the older survival show groups (that are still active) go. Like how they did in produce and how kep1er went to the bp final. The iland final will be July 13th which means if Kepler hadnâ€™t extended they would have disbanded the week before on July 3rd but Iâ€™m wonder will they go now and it will
Probably be their first schedule as ot7. Also while writing this I just thought about how kep1er will probably last longer that zb1 now since thereâ€™s no way weâ€™re getting that extension ðŸ˜­ so zb1 will be the only really temporary group there.</p>
