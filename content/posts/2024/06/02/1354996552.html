      <p>I dont follow the kside so did kgpd's ever complain about Gunwook bulking/ working out or gotten too bulky? I feel like with his proportions it's way better to be lean bulky instead of just straight up lean twig</p>

      <p>They think it's careless styling like his physical is putting in more work than the actual clothes
