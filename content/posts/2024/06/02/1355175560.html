      <p>"Twink is gay slang for a man who is usually (but not always) in his late teens to twenties whose traits may include a slim to average physique, a youthful appearance, little or no body hair, and flamboyancy." Wikipedia 

He's 20, slim, youthful in appearance, and has little to no body hair. The only thing missing is the flamboyancy, but that's not a necessity. 

Hao's a twink, so are Taerae, Gyuvin, Ricky and maybe Hanbin (all not bulky enough)

Jiwoong, Gunwook and Matthew are twunks 

and the term "Twink" can be applied to straight men as well. Tho mostly with a negative connotation</p>

      <p>Ricky is broad af he's got the broadest shoulders in Zb1 and he's got a MAN face not a youthful boy face and he is adrogynous in the same way that fake-bisexual David Bowie was adrogynous, i.e. with dramatic/glam styling and suave attitude.</p>
