      <p>"Twink is gay slang for a man who is usually (but not always) in his late teens to twenties whose traits may include a slim to average physique, a youthful appearance, little or no body hair, and flamboyancy." Wikipedia 

He's 20, slim, youthful in appearance, and has little to no body hair. The only thing missing is the flamboyancy, but that's not a necessity.¬†

Hao's a twink, so are Taerae, Gyuvin, Ricky and maybe Hanbin (all not bulky enough)

Jiwoong, Gunwook and Matthew are twunks¬†

and the term "Twink" can be applied to straight men as well. Tho mostly with a negative connotation</p>

      <p>No she's right they're all twinks nothing wrong with that they're all lean and youthful and smaller in stature which is the definition of twink, you don't have to be fem to be a twink (ex: thimotee chalzmet) jiwoong gunwook and Matthew twunk, this person has the correct terminology</p>

      <p>No it's also a lack of beef and youthfulness u gotta remember that it's a gay term first and foremost, if they were on Grindr they'd all be described as twins minus those 3 ain't nothing wrong with that</p>

      <p>but they're straight guys well gyuricky are and they're the average build for Asian men that's just not twinky to me and I wouldn't even call hanbin a twink either LIKE THATS WHATS THEYRE MISSING THEYRE NOT ON GRINDR!!! Because honestly by that logic you could call almost anyone a twink like taerae I can understand he's small and skinny hao is average so is hanbin
