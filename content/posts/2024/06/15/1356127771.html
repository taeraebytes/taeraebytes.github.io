      <p>Why I feel like Yujin, Gunwook, Taerae was absolutely not pannchoa admin pick durinv BP because she was posting that sohee stick leg with 20 comments, whilst others have already posted more comments than that, Yujin was literally trending a few days ago for visuals. Gunwook was also mentioned for being all rounder, she is definitely hanbin and Ricky biased from ZB1 and stan RIIZE in general, She cherry picked ZB1 hate articles as well. I need this bitch to be gone like BBOSONGEEEEE.</p>
