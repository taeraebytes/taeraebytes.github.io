      <p>It was so obvious. Last year, SM wasn't paying that old man to include Riize in BR ranking. Wonbin and even Seunghan were never included even if they're making so much noise in SK. But when TWS debuted in January and they gained attention, SM was threatened and finally paid the BR old man to bring Riize members to the fucking top of the ranking. SM doesn't see ZB1 as threat, I'm so mad. ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>Sm is not threatened by tws be serious? They were still  pretty high on the list in 2023. Love 119 was released in January it was their biggest hit and and riizeâ€™s popularity skyrocketed since then. As much as yâ€™all may not like them but donâ€™t underestimate their organic growth. theyâ€™re one of the biggest bgs in Korea rn and wonbin is one of the most talked idols rn Iâ€™m surprised heâ€™s not placed higher on the listðŸ¤”</p>

      <p>Anon, I know that Riize is so big & popular. The point is, members are so popular but they can't chart in BR because the BR old man is manipulating the list. He's purposely not including the Riize members unless SM pays him. When TWS songs rank so high on charts, higher than any Riize song, SM was threatened so the media play.</p>
