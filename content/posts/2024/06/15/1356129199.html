      <p>It was so obvious. Last year, SM wasn't paying that old man to include Riize in BR ranking. Wonbin and even Seunghan were never included even if they're making so much noise in SK. But when TWS debuted in January and they gained attention, SM was threatened and finally paid the BR old man to bring Riize members to the fucking top of the ranking. SM doesn't see ZB1 as threat, I'm so mad. 😂</p>

      <p>Sm is not threatened by tws be serious? They were still  pretty high on the list in 2023. Love 119 was released in January it was their biggest hit and and riize’s popularity skyrocketed since then. As much as y’all may not like them but don’t underestimate their organic growth. they’re one of the biggest bgs in Korea rn and wonbin is one of the most talked idols rn I’m surprised he’s not placed higher on the list🤔</p>
