 even with all the push this comeback, gigs, event appearances and even national baseball appearance gunwook still cant make it back in the BR list ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ been out for months because aside from the fandom nobody gaf about this sasaeng smoocher

go ahead and use the same excuse & say this is rigged but isnt even sadder and more pathetic for gunwook that even a rigged br list doesnt want him ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>It was so obvious. Last year, SM wasn't paying that old man to include Riize in BR ranking. Wonbin and even Seunghan were never included even if they're making so much noise in SK. But when TWS debuted in January and they gained attention, SM was threatened and finally paid the BR old man to bring Riize members to the fucking top of the ranking. SM doesn't see ZB1 as threat, I'm so mad. ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>Never. None of Riize member rank in Top 100. I was actually monitoring until December waiting for Wonbin because I know he has the potential to go as high as Top 1. I want Allins to stfu on their highest 5th gen agenda. ðŸ˜­</p>
