      <p>It was so obvious. Last year, SM wasn't paying that old man to include Riize in BR ranking. Wonbin and even Seunghan were never included even if they're making so much noise in SK. But when TWS debuted in January and they gained attention, SM was threatened and finally paid the BR old man to bring Riize members to the fucking top of the ranking. SM doesn't see ZB1 as threat, I'm so mad. 😂</p>

      <p>Never. None of Riize member rank in Top 100. I was actually monitoring until December waiting for Wonbin because I know he has the potential to go as high as Top 1. I want Allins to stfu on their highest 5th gen agenda. 😭</p>

      <p>Lotus!!! You crazy. Do you think we don't like Wonbin hitting #1?😭 We do!😭 We like seeing Hanbin's fans suffer from shame and embarassment. Let Wonbin stay in Top 10 and Hanbin nowhere near 20 even with those gigs given by his company.</p>
