      <p>im so depressed we coulda had it all if it werent for jiwoong and if gyuvin just learnt when to shut up earlier, i blame his hs friends for not telling him to shut up sooner so it coulda prevented this like not every word that comes to mind has to be verbally said ughhhhhhhhhhhh i still like gyuvin tho at least he went through some depression/ redemption arc but fuck ass jiwoong still smiling as if nothing happened ESPECIALLY right after his scandal that ruined everything the members and us fans worked so hard on and made us lose the korean gp i can never forgive him. fuck you jiwoong. youre old as fuck. you already debuted once so you should know how hard it is to gain gp support so now that u finally had a taste of it why tf did u single handedly destroy it? fuck u. if it was another member i wouldn't care cause its their first time idol but the fact that hes the oldest and had prior experience as an idol and hes the reason for us losing the korean gp is so fucking annoying. if anything he should know better but hes ruining it not just for us but the members who worked so hard to become idols now have to suffer and work extra hard to gain gp support back cause of him.

if we ever gain korean gp back its all the other members hard work and not fuck ass jiwoong. if he dares accept an award and dares speak into the mic i hope someone throws an egg at him. sorry i just had to rant.</p>

      <p>Compared to jiwoong gyuvin was an Angel and his scandals effected him only so it's whatever but I will alwaysssss think jiwoong is an evil dark being like he is showing no kinda remorse in fact he looks litter than he was before like does he enjoy ruining their prospects cuz let's be honest he's the one that needs it the least and benefits the least UGHHHHH I can't forgive him
