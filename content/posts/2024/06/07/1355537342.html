      <p>3/4 other members are almost 180 which is already pretty tall esp compared to average height in korea but gunwook would be considered really tall literally anywhere üò≠ and it‚Äôs not a bad thing</p>

      <p>oh no yujin and jiwoong are way shorter than their official heights so is hanbin they're a lot smaller irl especiallyyy jiwoong so like a 3+ inch difference is big I didn't say it's a bad thing but let's pick up some new vocab it's annoying

      <p>Even outside yujin jiwoong and Hanbin hao Ricky guubin and gunwook are all for sure over 180 so that's still 4, and those three while noticeable smaller aren't that far from hao either , they're a tall ass group</p>

      <p>i remember u saying ur quite tall so i feel like that‚Äôs gotta be taken into account into how u view their height. i‚Äôm just over average but my family‚Äôs tall so i feel like if i saw zb1 irl i wouldn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre that tall either, other than maybe the tallest 3. lots of girls are just short as hell which is why most fans view zb1 as tall when it‚Äôs not anything too crazy imo</p>

      <p>Yea haha I'm 5'9 so any guy close to my height is short to me I don't consider any of zb1 tall except for gyuriwook and hao like I see ppl call them a crazy talk group all the time but they're just not to me. Also when I saw riize at the airport I was a little disappointed like Anton is obv taller than me but I just didn't feel the hugeness cuz I'm huge tooüíî ugh I need to shrink before I see gunwook
