 well.. why do they have to check it if it’s with others but hanbin doesn’t have to ask for permission if it’s him alone?</p>

      <p>rosins were doing too much with that statement saying that it's bc wakeone isn't allowing post's about hao and that hanbin is getting privilege bc he doesn't have to ask for his solo posts like they need to be serious</p>

      <p>like I think solo posting is the most freedom they get and I understand the hesitance it's not just the case of zb1 but so many micro scandals come from duo/unit/group posts cuz it's more ppl to account and be responsible for like for ex tbzs beach scandal
