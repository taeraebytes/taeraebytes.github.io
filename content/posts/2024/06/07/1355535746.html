Selling more Hao merch while making it look like he isnt selling well because other members are going out of stock first when he has 3-4x what other members have. And it's actually shocking that he has 2-3x more than locals Hanbin and Yujin. Even in online sites. WK1 is seriously greedy while being whatever -phobic they have against Hao. Unfortunately for you anon, Matthew and Ricky has the least stocks in SK",
