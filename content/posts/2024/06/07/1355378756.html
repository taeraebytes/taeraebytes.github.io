      <p>the period right after comeback is usually the most annoying and insufferable when solo jobs start rolling out and the fandom starts getting bored especially if there's not enough interesting content i'm already scared</p>

      <p>They could literally just plagiarized old going seventeen episodes like every kpop self variety shows have the same concept and you can do some with very low budget too omg this is one thing I really understand like this should be a priority along with lives like even if you can't do ot9 lives because of jiwoong there should be wayyyy more constant free lives in duos and trio that one Hanbin hao Ricky jiwoong one was boring but still more fun cause you could still see them interact</p>
