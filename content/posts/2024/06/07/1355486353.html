      <p>I‚Äôm acc getting ticked off at seeing those tiktok slideshow comparisons ab Ricky‚Äôs makeup. Yes he overlines his lips and the aegyosal makeup is a tadddd bit much but all this hoorah ab his makeup knowing how much I‚Äôve suffered from sep-Feb ricky when he couldn‚Äôt put those contacts down and his hair was fried as shit and his eyebrows were thinner than ever WHO ARE WE TO COMPLAIN? Omg I was so close to unstanning at that point I thought they killed my Ricky forever but I think wk1 kinda listened to my smart rukidan sisters & made him dip into his natural cute side. This aegyosal, lip makeup nonsense is irking now like we had it way worse & he still looks better than 99% of these kpop boys so a win is a win</p>
