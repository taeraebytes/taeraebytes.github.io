      <p>Kepler appearing on more shows compared to zb1 while we couldn't even get a simple relay dance it's either they're not invited bc of jw scandals or whoever manage zb1s emails fucked up</p>

      <p>Bc zb1 team acts like they are some a-list celebs that can only attend big shows. Kep1er shows are usually YouTube shows that doesn't always have a big amount of views meanwhile for zb1 they want to only send them to tv shows or YouTube shows with big amount of views or YouTube shows that are associated with a big broadcast company like lee mujin show, Eunchae's diary, 1N2D idol version, etc.</p>
