      <p>If anyone is nosy keep in mind that this could all be fake I'm just sharing to the nosy ppl but on jnctzens twt they do believe the rumours and they're saying johnny haechan mark jungwoo taeyong and I think jaehyun are promiscuous the rest of dream and wayv are safe for now, this one acc is saying that haechan Johnny and jungwoo stans better unstan rn even if it's hard because there's so much more about them like videos and pics it's interesting because it's very rare for jkpop stans to open up and talk publicly which is why male idols usually go there to fuck</p>

      <p>they keep saying there's pics and videos, i'm surprised they didn't post those since saying that is pretty big and concrete and has this expectation put on u. obviously different situation but with the seunghan thing they kept going and revealing more so i thought it'd take that route. i believe it tho, fans will deny everything but it's not that unbelievable. y'all say korean men are slimy, y'all made ur bed, sleep in it!!!!!</p>
