    "reply": "Yea haha I'm 5'9 so any guy close to my height is short to me I don't consider any of zb1 tall except for gyuriwook and hao like I see ppl call them a crazy talk group all the time but they're just not to me. Also when I saw riize at the airport I was a little disappointed like Anton is obv taller than me but I just didn't feel the hugeness cuz I'm huge too💔 ugh I need to shrink before I see gunwook"

      <p>3/4 other members are almost 180 which is already pretty tall esp compared to average height in korea but gunwook would be considered really tall literally anywhere 😭 and it’s not a bad thing</p>

      <p>oh no yujin and jiwoong are way shorter than their official heights so is hanbin they're a lot smaller irl especiallyyy jiwoong so like a 3+ inch difference is big I didn't say it's a bad thing but let's pick up some new vocab it's annoying

      <p>Even outside yujin jiwoong and Hanbin hao Ricky guubin and gunwook are all for sure over 180 so that's still 4, and those three while noticeable smaller aren't that far from hao either , they're a tall ass group</p>
