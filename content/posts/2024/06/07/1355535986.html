      <p>well i got curious and decided to snoop around and it looks like elle korea, harpers bazaar korea, esquire and cosmopolitan all are one family under joongang group. joongang group is also the parent company of jtbc. jtbc and cjnm have been working together since 2019 because of their joint streaming platform tving... meaning that cjnm and joongang group are probably pretty friendly with each other. zb1s first big magazine cover was for elle korea thanks to cjnm, who is under joongang group. 

smaller magazine covers of zb1: 1st look completely belongs to cjnm. dazed is not affiliated or connected to cjnm (from what ive seen/heard). the singles is not affiliated/connected to cjnm but clean perfume is affiliated with olive young, who is cjnm.

allure korea on the other hand is under doosan magazine alongside vogue korea, gq korea and w korea. their subsidiaries except two (marketing agencies) are all unrelated to the entertainment industry. zb1 has never been on one of their magazines.</p>
