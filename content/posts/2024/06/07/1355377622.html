      <p>the group is literally great if you donâ€™t have solos yapping in your ear 24/7 about how much it sucks like genuinely some of yâ€™all need to step AWAY from the fandom if you actually want to enjoy yourself cuz letting the fandom cloud your judgement is crazy ðŸ˜­ i literally saw someone say that cc made them unstan and dislike zb1 like why tf are you letting anonymous bitches who lie on cc determine your feelings about the group ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>Oh I don't mean that I meant thw way I operate as a fan naturally I was speaking personally. I knew I was gonna barely like half the group going into this and anyone that's been here long enough would be able to tell I actually used to hate the group but because they're in actual dire conditions I have to give them all my lvoe cuz no one else willðŸ˜¢ðŸ’” but also because the majority of this fandom is so wrong about this group it hurts like now I have to be a participating fan and do shit right. Like they're definitely a great group I just have to troll because it's in my blood but we gotta lock in now
