      <p>Yeah also no offense but if they wanted her to have longevity and hit big with multiple demographics they shouldâ€™ve made her a pop girlie or at least give her a house/deep house sound, with a sound like water she was doomed to be a one hit wonder and yes ppl these days only care abt actors</p>

      <p>jump isnt a flop though, but afrobeats/amp is not mainstream music meaning its good for a quick trend but a whole discography of that music style isnt going to be played on radio</p>
