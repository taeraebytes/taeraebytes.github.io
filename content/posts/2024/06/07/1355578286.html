      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean it‚Äôs only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>
