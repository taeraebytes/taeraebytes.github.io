      <p>Jiwoong also chews tobacco that's why he got a faux porcelain veneer set from a veneer techs basement 

gunwook a barista and from New York OH LORD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” uhm yea they'd be into weed yujin probably romanticizes poverty gunwook romanticizes some dumb young teen life style from books

Ricky would die with a cart in his hand 

I thought Matthew was from Toronto for the longest he just seems like it but he's also too soft for it in a way 

Hao works at the atlanta restaurant that tried to hoe Keith Lee ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
