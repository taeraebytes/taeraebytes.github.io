      <p>Eh I wouldn‚Äôt take this too seriously if you go to the blip app and see what they count as ‚Äòschedules‚Äô this list makes sense. Everything and I mean literally everything is counted, from twt post to tiktok challanges with other idols and each episode of mcing for yj and hb and they even include that mc live thing hanbin does as a separate schedule each week. So I wouldn‚Äôt take this as the best representation of actual schedules because there‚Äôs no way gyuvin has had more actual job schedules than hao.</p>
