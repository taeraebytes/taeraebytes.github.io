      <p>This is absolutely building something out of nothing but I thought this repo was interesting, looking past the fanservicey answer I wonder if the caring bit was about fans negative reaction to their tripðŸ‘€ hao has this very independent dominant conflictual personality Vs Hanbins very subservient submissive but perfectionist one

So Hao would see not caring about fans ordering them around as caring for the groups wellbeing while Hanbin would see it as unprofessional we've seen that he even listen and report criticism about the other members with the Matthew thing, I wonder if hanbin is stricter and more confrontational privately and I wonder how gyuvin fits into that dynamic lol
