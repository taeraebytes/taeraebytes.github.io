      <p>The way beginning of 2021 all them unfollowed megan 
Rihanna, Kylie, Drake, Etc etc like it was so sad to witness and then her own bf threw her under the bus and it didnâ€™t even matter that BeyoncÃ© took her under her wing because she nonchalant af and barely even talks abt her own artist</p>
