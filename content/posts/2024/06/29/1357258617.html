      <p>now that I think about it they are pretty similar ðŸ˜­ when theres controversy sungchan likes shady tweets to gaslight the fandom to sympathize and pity him and when gyuvin gets into controversy he sends depressed bbl msgs and mentions the member helping him out emotionally so the fandom will pity him. 

gyuvin better tho at least he aint shading his own members at the height of their scandals ðŸ˜­</p>
