      <p>Why would she marry him when that would be career suicide. She doesn't even talk about him or post with him bc she knows that her being seen at the same events with him is already too much for the type of fans she has and wants to attract. 

When she was at the F1 event she was taking pics and he was hiding 😭. That marriage is never happening, at best it could happen an SNSD Sooyoung situation on where she has been dating that man for like 12 years and at least acknowledges him but she says that they won't be marrying bc of her career.</p>

      <p>uh because his fathers the richest man in the world she still cares ab her career now but I think her goal is to marry him or stay with him why else would she subject herself to a lame ugly French guy unless that's what she's into.. but I doubt it's happening either his family is never letting him marry her
