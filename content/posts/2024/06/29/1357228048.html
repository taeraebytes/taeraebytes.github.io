      <p>Diff anon but yasss! Tomorrow  is after sun but theyâ€™re gonna reveal the casa amour bombshells so itâ€™ll be interesting to watch this time. Also I truly think Serena and Kordell can win since they have the white Facebook moms, NFL Stanâ€™s, black twt and TikTok on their side they just gotta stick with each other and play it smart</p>
