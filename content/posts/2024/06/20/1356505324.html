    "question": "Was it Janghaneul who did ps? Girlie is so inactive so I'll be asking you since I'm so curious. I saw a girl who undewent major PS. Like jaw shave and chin shave, rhinoplasty, double eye lid, forehead &cheeks. But I'm curious on how the fuck is her skin still looks so supple, so clean, so spotless, no scarring, no signs of knife. Everytime you guys say that Hanbin did so much on his face, I always find it weird since he goes near the camera bareface and I can't see any sign of scarring. What kind of technology do they have in the clinics to maintain the skin’s texture and remove all scars?",
