      <p>interesting tweet i saw said that tempest are doing fansign for a song that came out in march, cravity the same for a song that came out in january. we all know riize did the same, evnne did fansigns every week for 4 months straight. and ggs are no exception ive did baddie album fansigns for a crazy long time too. this is such a dystopian fanculture</p>
