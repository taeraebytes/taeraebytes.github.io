      <p>Who in zb1 would cheat based on a very quick look through their chart absolutely not in depth since no birth times
Jiwoong: yes and will gaslight tf out of you, could still get into a serious relationship and express regret but would still do it yes
Hao: ehh not necessarily might need a lot of attention though so if flirting around is cheating then yes, if he does it's not for fun though it's self sabotage or emotional unfulfillment 
Hanbin: yeah def he's a Gemini stellium w a pisces moon and sag mars but he can def commit and blove his partner deeply but yeah
Matthew: there's a possibility ofc but no I don't think so similarly to hao if he did it'd be very heavy emotionally and self sabotage 
Ricky: oh yeah he's cheating down but maybe regretting it afterwards and really reflecting if he gets into a good one but yeah no
Gyuvin: probably not if he did probably intoxicated and would regret it a lot 
Gunwook: yeah but could also seriously commit kinda like hanbin
Yujin: yeah and would gaslight down too but could also comit strongly kinda like Hanbin again</p>

      <p>Oop and for a more serious answer I can't tell you who's a terrible or good person more so this is about personal preference in personality and who you match with!

Also birth times changes things a lot and people can be evolved or still immature so things show up differently it all depends

He has cancer sun and Mercury so he's very emotional and empathetic and it does explain why he writes well but it's also related to the mother and babies so usually it's kinda the stereotype of a mother who cares deeply but also had that ego thing where they say mean and blunt things impulsively, this is coupled with a Leo mars which is very good for performance but makes the ego thing worse because they struggle to take criticism and take everything into a personal offense, cancer+Leo gives me that mama's boy manbaby vibe and kinda attention seeking at their worst and extremely warm hearted, empathetic and kind at their best, he's a virgo moon and venus which makes it extra hard cause even if he does care he struggles to show it and makes it hard to handle all his emotions like it's hard to tell when a virgo Venus loves you so yeah really the complicated mother figure is how I would describe it but I haven't checked his aspects in depth
