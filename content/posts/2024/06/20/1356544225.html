      <p>what hes doing is just plain wrong people get callled all the time by wrong numbers all them and for him to go as far to expose those people when he doesnâ€™t even know if they are sasaengs is just plain stupid i hope these people expose his number for free since he wants the expose peopleâ€™s numbers on such a larger scale. That fat bastard ðŸ˜’</p>

      <p>HFJDJNDNFJFKFKIDJDJXD yea I don't think he should be exposing anything if he's not 100% if they're a sasaeng or not he's actually crashing out before our eyes

      <p>Yeah but imagine you get followed and called everywhere constantly you'd be crashing out too reminds me of Avril Lavigne and willow smith saying they get paranoia and hear paparazzi when they're alone or sleeping</p>

      <p>No yea I get why he's acting like this but someone needs to calm him down it's best to handle this legally there's people who have all his info that could try to hurt him or smth
