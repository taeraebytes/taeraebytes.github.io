      <p>sent a phone number on his bubble saying it’s a sasaeng’s and to stop calling. the phone number’s alleged “friend” went on twitter to explain her friend was just calling an acquaintance whose number she didn’t know well(?) and the man on the phone told her he’d be reporting the number and stuff. she wants renjun to apologise to her for disclosing her ph number like that. apparently the manager apologized to her but renjun said since she might be a sasaeng that’s just lying, he won’t be apologizing</p>

      <p>and the quotes aren’t in his favor at all like they’re saying even if they’re actually a sasaeng he shouldn’t have exposed a commoner’s private info like that, which I find ironic cos if it’s rly a sasaeng it’s renjun’s private info being exploited, which in turn is hypocritical cos renjun of all ppl should know how it feels to have ur private info exposed (which is why he probably did it) but it’s rly a hypocritical ping pong situation 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

      <p>I guess you could say that but you gotta consider his emotional turmoil and descent into madness he should just stop exposing numbers it's not doing him any good and innocent ppl could be catching strays like there's a reason shit is handled legally
