Wall, a big one

Hanbin with his unstable and airy vocal. If people are still thinking that Hanbin is the 3rd best vocalist in ZB1, get your ears checked. Gunwook has been improving his vocal skills while Hanbin's, who only knows how to strain to show off his high notes has been declining. If you listen to both Hao and Gunwook, you'll be comfortable knowing that they'll hit the notes. For Hanbin, it's scary cos his voice is all over the place that he's getting off key. And it's an easy song, for god's sake.</p>
