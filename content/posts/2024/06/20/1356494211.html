      <p>Who in zb1 would cheat based on a very quick look through their chart absolutely not in depth since no birth times
Jiwoong: yes and will gaslight tf out of you, could still get into a serious relationship and express regret but would still do it yes
Hao: ehh not necessarily might need a lot of attention though so if flirting around is cheating then yes, if he does it's not for fun though it's self sabotage or emotional unfulfillment 
Hanbin: yeah def he's a Gemini stellium w a pisces moon and sag mars but he can def commit and blove his partner deeply but yeah
Matthew: there's a possibility ofc but no I don't think so similarly to hao if he did it'd be very heavy emotionally and self sabotage 
Ricky: oh yeah he's cheating down but maybe regretting it afterwards and really reflecting if he gets into a good one but yeah no
Gyuvin: probably not if he did probably intoxicated and would regret it a lot 
Gunwook: yeah but could also seriously commit kinda like hanbin
Yujin: yeah and would gaslight down too but could also comit strongly kinda like Hanbin again</p>

      <p>it's awful depending on who you ask because he's a cancer sun (water sign) and virgo moon (earth sign) cancers are notoriously known as the most sensitive and emotional sign which people always interpret them to be crybabies (which they ARE) but it also comes out in other ways with getting defensive and mad over small things it's common to all water signs also cancers make people feel like they can talk and vent about anything which they use to their advantage and can get manipulative 

virgos are judgemental and will let u know an opinion no matter what 

me personally I really like his chart as someone who always has water and earth signs in their chart but I can see why someone with fire and air signs might dislike it since they clash a lot</p>
