      <p>interesting tweet i saw said that tempest are doing fansign for a song that came out in march, cravity the same for a song that came out in january. we all know riize did the same, evnne did fansigns every week for 4 months straight. and ggs are no exception ive did baddie album fansigns for a crazy long time too. this is such a dystopian fanculture</p>

      <p>yes ikr i know you don't particularly care about evnne but i'll take this as a chance to rant anyways in case your anons want more insight on how bad things are. 

they came back with ugly/un:seen late january and the era only officially ended april 30th with their final fancalls. during that they went on an asia tour and in person fansigns at every stop + one in mainland china. 

right after their final fc, they announced another comeback + an american tour which made fans upset considering they have close to no american fans (only two stops are sold out rn btw it's how bad it is) and all their fans are in japan...

 then they announced that they were going to waterbomb fukouka (on the day before jihoo's birthday) and people were upset cause jihoo will still be a minor during their waterbomb date and that if he wasn't able to attend (which was officially announced by wb like 2 weeks ago for his own safety since it was an 18+ event)  he'd miss out on celebrating his bday with the rest of the members. 

ALL THAT! and they're not even allowed to attend big awards shows or stuff like MAMA bc they have this weird clause with zb1 (they attended the only kcon zb1 didn't attend last year) and it's so frustrating esp when the fans dgaf and will get mad when people complain like ugh being an ennve is worse than being a zerose sorry you guys.</p>
