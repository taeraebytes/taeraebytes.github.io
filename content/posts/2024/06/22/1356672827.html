      <p>I did family relationship numerology

Jiwoong - he has good relationships with parents and brothers.

Hanbin - Very Closed to his parents and his sisters.

Hao - Very Closed to his family and younger brother

Matthew: Very close to his family and sister

Taerae  : More close to his sister than his parents 

Ricky: I believe he dont have very strong attachment towards his family. Idk he definitely has bad childhood 

Gyuvin : Very close to his parents and grandparents and his siblings as well

Gunwook  He is very close to his grand parents,  he has very strong bonding with his elder brothers 

Yujin : He loves his mother so much he is not very close with his dad or his younger brother I feel like his dad has been not very nice to him.</p>
