      <p>gunwook really seems like the glue that holds this group together it never seems like hes awkward with anyone except maybe jiwoong sometimes but even then he’s good at hiding it</p>

      <p>Gyuvin is also close w everyone expect jiwoong but he's very selective on how he chooses to present those relationships and only does what will bring him clou gunwook? He's real asfk and fair that's a true friend</p>
