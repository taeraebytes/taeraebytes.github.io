      <p>For ZB1, this is really accurate. Jiwoong has been in the kpop industry for ten years and still struggles with his vocals. RIIZE analysis is also really correct; they don't have any good vocalists on the team save Sohee. Sungchan's escape from the crime of being a horrible singer is beyond my comprehension. Wonbin's voice is quite robotic and nasal, and he is the second best vocalist on the team. If Eunseok and Sungchan were in ZB1, they would likewise be dragged but because they are a vocal powerhouse, the Iroaches believe they are good singers.</p>
