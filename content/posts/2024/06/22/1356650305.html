      <p>Our future lowkey makes me depressed bc weâ€™ll definitely be spending the remaining year and a half still complaining about wakeone and their stupid management decisions. And wakeone is never gonna change no matter how loud we are ðŸ¥² if we want more casual lives, reality content, better promotion, etc we most likely wont get it it just sucks how weâ€™ll spend our limited time begging for things this fuckass company wont listen to</p>
