      <p>Evnne and riize definitely don't belong on the same level imo because seungeon >> sohee and park hanbin>seunghan but let's be real this boy is not coming back so its actually park hanbin > wonbin and yunseo > anton

And one pact fans losing their shit in the comments cuz they weren't included when the only who can sing is jay and he's way below taerae zhang hao seungeon and sohee</p>
