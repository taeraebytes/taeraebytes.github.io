      <p>People always blame wakeone and his fans for Hanbin not wacking and voguing which obviously plays a part in it but it's also because he's insecure and a pussy</p>

      <p>I think at least in his free time like when he does dance lives or just posting cover videos like yujin fans want him to wack and vogue for two reasons :

One, engagement and fame: he's a good dancer in other genres but it's nothing we haven't seen before, we have too much good dancers in kpop he doesn't stand out as much, it would bring muuuuch more clout, engagement and discussions if he, as a male idol did what he's professionally trained in and what p much no one else does

Two, I think a lot of people expect that rep from his cause he was part of the community for so long and it feels icky to queer fans to think he just gave up on it at the first check to fit in and please his insane fans, they'd rather think he's forced, but from BP already it was pretty obvious he was never gonna bring that rep, he's someone who values image over anything else, he's scared 

Personally I empathise w him cause it's sk not America I wouldn't say he's a total sell out it's not the same circumstances, zb1 had some of the vilest homophobic rumours made about them, Hanbin simply isn't Hao he cannot just keep it moving his self image is already fragile to begin with, such huge backlash made him even more weak and submissive</p>
