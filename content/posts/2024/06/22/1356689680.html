      <p>People always blame wakeone and his fans for Hanbin not wacking and voguing which obviously plays a part in it but it's also because he's insecure and a pussy</p>

      <p>well no several really popular kpop choreos like super shy or roller coaster include waacking so itâ€™s not like they canâ€™t incorporate it ðŸ˜­ and it was kind of trendy to include those elements in choreos last year so i feel like it could have been good to capitalize on those elements while having someone who literally specializes in that dance style. same with tutting, hand movement choreos in general weâ€™re just popular last year</p>

      <p>They're gg choreos I've yet to see it incorporated for a boygroup I feel like it's possible but it's just veryyy unlikely consider who they work with as well
