      <p>This is a general question because I wasn't around during bp but I've always been curious what role forums like pann, dc, instiz, etc played during the show? Did they matter or was twitter where everything really happened</p>

      <p>The constant posts on pann showed ppl cared but they were cussing gwk too much for my liking. But lowkey they pushed Ricky to the majority of viewers. Instiz idc and dc didn't have much influence, they were hating on taerae who at point had so much support. Dc inside is like the only forum to find Korean opinions for shows not popular in Korea like runext or iland2, but boys planet was already heavily discussed on Twitter and pann</p>
