      <p>People always blame wakeone and his fans for Hanbin not wacking and voguing which obviously plays a part in it but it's also because he's insecure and a pussy</p>

      <p>also that has no place in idol group choreo so idk what they mean by "icb he has to dance to fucking zb1 choreos when he can do this" like ehhhh maybe he can do that again after disbandment when he's back to being a dancer he's literally an idol now</p>

      <p>well no several really popular kpop choreos like super shy or roller coaster include waacking so itâ€™s not like they canâ€™t incorporate it ðŸ˜­ and it was kind of trendy to include those elements in choreos last year so i feel like it could have been good to capitalize on those elements while having someone who literally specializes in that dance style. same with tutting, hand movement choreos in general weâ€™re just popular last year</p>

      <p>They're gg choreos I've yet to see it incorporated for a boygroup I feel like it's possible but it's just veryyy unlikely consider who they work with as well

      <p>so in the end the point is u want zb1 to rotate around hanbinâ€™s little traits? like why are we even having to discuss zb1â€™s dance catering to waccking and voguing just cos itâ€™s what hanbin excels at? can he not do that in his own time?</p>
