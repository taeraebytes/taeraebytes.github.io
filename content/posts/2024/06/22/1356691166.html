      <p>People always blame wakeone and his fans for Hanbin not wacking and voguing which obviously plays a part in it but it's also because he's insecure and a pussy</p>

      <p>No I don't particularly care I'm talking about the fans saying wakeone are making him erase it when a lot of people leave their community if it means going forward in their careers and that's what he's doing I doubt wakeone are telling him not to wack and he could simply not try to subserve his fans</p>
