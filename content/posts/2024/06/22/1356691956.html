      <p>CAN YALL STOP BRINGING THIS MF UP?!??!!!! I can't help but want to rant everytime I see his name. Bro brings nothing NOTHING to the table no vocals no dance no chemistry no bonds like I'll admit he's funny sometimes when he makes a fool outta himself and he looks good when his eyes aren't bulging out but that's it. Bro brought nothing and gave us negative energy that we now gotta deal with adsfsfryfhhufsjtsjtshmxkysi6wi5q5qutqtwsfqdasitsjtsjtai5wi5skydkydo6</p>
