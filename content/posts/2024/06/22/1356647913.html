      <p>yujin did that dance live a week or 2 ago but yeah they're very rare now. i don't get why they completely stopped doing unit/solo lives on instagram, not everyone is paying the subscription for plus chat and those almost never have other members. even a big portion of their plus chat posts (like the regular ones not the ones that are like bubble) are behind a membership paywall it pisses me off bc it feels like we don't have enough group content as it is üòí</p>
