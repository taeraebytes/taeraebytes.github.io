      <p>Jaehyun is corny and his jokes are lame. I would react like that too. He is such an annoying attention seeker.</p>

      <p>girl I don't even like jaehyun but he was promoting their comeback bc fuck ass riize couldn't stand up and do shit for themselves and while he was doing that their boring asses couldn't at least do some fake ass reaction bc they don't emote and the only excuse their fans can come up with is that sm is trying to make them mysterious</p>
