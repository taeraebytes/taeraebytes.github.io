      <p>Diff anon and u really saw none of what was happening on the kside? I thought lotus would know if anything ðŸ˜­ I just checked my bookmarks and they all got deleted because it got ratio'd and these went viral with like 10k+ qrts each, millions of views and it was basically kbrice saying how cute it is that rice is so quiet and have no reaction but they got ratioed in the qrts by knets and the qrts got even more traction it was so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Here's one of the qrts about rice not reacting to jaehyun who was promoting their song but rice gave nothing and it was just silence
