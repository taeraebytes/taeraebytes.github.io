      <p>the new bg yuehuaz power duo thing will not work because most powerful duos are close in age, fans can ship them thats why they work so well. yujin is also FAR behind hao when it comes to talents. if yuehua were smart they would pair ricky and haos instead. 

i personally dont think that hao will redebut with the others because of his age 🤷‍♀️ hea too old</p>
