      <p>I and k fans are so divided.

kfans are on the 'sasaeng' side because they provided proof is was a genuine miss call and that they're not a sasaeng, their old moot changed numbers but the op still had their moots number contact info saved under their moots name so assumed it was them and called them thinking them cause who wouldn't, and when renjun answered she realized her moot changed numbers and she never called that number again. Then renjun leaked her number on bubble and she started getting bombarded with death threats from local numbers and international numbers all be of a genuine mistake.

International fans think this 'sasaeng' is playing victim that all she said was bullshit and that sm never cared for their artists privacy and never protects them. That sm is hungry for money and sasaengs contribute to some of the money etc. These conspiracies are killing me I mean a huge part is true but not for this situation I think.

I think the most telling op isn't a sasaeng is them going to the police, because if they were a sasaeng why would they self rat themselves and if they are a sasaeng I'm sure sm has info on them, especially since even the manager apologized to her who probably has all the deets on sasaengs yet renjun still refused to when all this blew up a few days ago. I feel like his past history with sasaengs is fucking him up in the head and he thinks everyone is against him and if you're not his fan your a sasaeng there's no in between.</p>
