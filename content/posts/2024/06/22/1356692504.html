      <p>People always blame wakeone and his fans for Hanbin not wacking and voguing which obviously plays a part in it but it's also because he's insecure and a pussy</p>

      <p>I think at least in his free time like when he does dance lives or just posting cover videos like yujin fans want him to wack and vogue for two reasons :

One, engagement and fame: he's a good dancer in other genres but it's nothing we haven't seen before, we have too much good dancers in kpop he doesn't stand out as much, it would bring muuuuch more clout, engagement and discussions if he, as a male idol did what he's professionally trained in and what p much no one else does

Two, I think a lot of people expect that rep from his cause he was part of the community for so long and it feels icky to queer fans to think he just gave up on it at the first check to fit in and please his insane fans, they'd rather think he's forced, but from BP already it was pretty obvious he was never gonna bring that rep, he's someone who values image over anything else, he's scared 

Personally I empathise w him cause it's sk not America I wouldn't say he's a total sell out it's not the same circumstances, zb1 had some of the vilest homophobic rumours made about them, Hanbin simply isn't Hao he cannot just keep it moving his self image is already fragile to begin with, such huge backlash made him even more weak and submissive</p>

      <p>?????? I feel like it's entitled to expect something of him and feel icky if he doesn't like it's his choice he didn't ask to be a representative for anyone and it's only a perception we have no confirmation on his sexuality or contributions to the queer community if that's what ur referring to. I think it would be cool if he uploaded tutting or whacking covers but because he likes it not cuz he's trynna fill a rep quota for random ppl on the internet

      <p>I don't know why but I'm starting to get irritated by his weak personality. He looked more confident and happy dancing this same genre before during. I saw a lot of comments about waacking in his live today. I don't think someone who used to enjoy dancing like that would suddenly hate it. It has been years since he last did waacking. He definitely loves waacking but is scared of how people will see him if he does it. He is too focused on his image and it is pissing me off. He even once said in a live it has been long since he last did waacking and that he isn't as good anymore. That hurt me so much. I started liking him because of his waacking and voguing. It isn't even about being queer or something but I was shocked that a male kpop idol could be so talented in that dance genre. But now knowing that he will never show us that, I feel so hurt and hateful.</p>

      <p>I'm actually agreein w op about the weak personality and image stuff but  not for the dancing, I get him for that cause receiving that much homophobia can be actually traumatizing for anyone it can be so hard to put yourself publicly again in that way after receiving so much abhorrent and vile comments AND see your close teammate be outed like people kill themselves for shit like this that shit gotta be traumatising esp if he's queer
However his insecurities get the best of him, I think telling Matthew shit his antis would tell him was fucked up for example, I don't think he had bad intentions but it showed that he was soo worried about public perception he allowed and cosigned such comments about one of his close homie he needs therapy I'm not saying that as an insult btw just you can just tell how much fear and anxiety control him even as a performer and that's unhealthy, I'm just saying that as an audience member tho I obvs don't know him</p>
