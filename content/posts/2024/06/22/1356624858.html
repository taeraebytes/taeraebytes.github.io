      <p>I am sorry but rosins getting mad as hell at Hanbin for the weight comments just for Zhang Hao to have the same mindset as Hanbin and being like we need to stop eating snacks bc we got fat kinda kills me like I am surprised that rosins never noticed that their fave ain't better than Hanbin, like they are almost the same person lol.</p>
