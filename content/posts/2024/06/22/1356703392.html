      <p>Jaehyun is corny and his jokes are lame. I would react like that too. He is such an annoying attention seeker.</p>

      <p>as a riize fan i just watch when wonbin and sohee appear (and anton except i switch to 2x speed when he appears bc he talks so slow but heâ€™s cute so i donâ€™t want to miss it) and skip everything else bc sohee is actually charismatic (we had to say thank you mcd) and wonbin is cute and kind of strange and he just yaps and over shares and if you get bored you can just stare at his face also him and sohee randomly break into song a lot</p>
