      <p>the estimated demand thing only applies to things like the fancon or if wakeone was the one holding the pop up store. line puts out the same amount for every member. its not a big amount either because they dont want things to not het sold so i really dont know how one of haos items didnt get sold out but every other members did ðŸ˜¬ there is also a rule of only two per customer on line shops, that could be the reason why haos items are still on shelves</p>
