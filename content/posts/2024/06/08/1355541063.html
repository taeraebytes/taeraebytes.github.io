      <p>you people always say this wanting it to be true when zb1 is a group literally known for SALES.  ðŸ˜­ trust no brand or business is gonna give a fuck about these silly things when they can make good profit, it's time yall accept they're just not the 5th gen it group anymore sadly, from brand deals to variety show appearances to uni festivals to jiwoong they've gotten overshadowed by their peers and the sooner yall accept it the better</p>
