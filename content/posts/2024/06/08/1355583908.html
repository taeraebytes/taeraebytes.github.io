      <p>ost = he was the first one to get before the main vocalists
special stage = again first one to get it at mcountdown
kcon stages = he's literally mc-ing at every single kcon

you hoes are so fucking annoying znd greedy ntm his gigs are the biggest and give the most exposure meanwhile other members get scraps here and there like i'll never take yall seriously ever</p>
