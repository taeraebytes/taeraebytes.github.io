      <p>it's so funny how mcd loves him downnnnkdsnfksdnf like with music show mcs there's like an Even vibe if that makes sense but with mcd it's the hanbin show ft his sidekicks jaehyun and sohee (mostly thinking about the music show room guests like nowadays being on when they're nugu and no one cares about them other than how hanbin used to train with them, hui was prob hanbin influence, a lot of nct which is sohee too bc company mates but like. hanbin LMAO also gyuvin visited mcd yesterday to see ateez do we think hanbin put a word in to get them on so gyuvin could meet them again) and i mean i'm not opposed to it bc love hanbin dgaf about jaehyun and sohee but it's funny to look at like damn</p>

      <p>Am I the only one that thinks itâ€™s better that way like Iâ€™d be way more concerned if mnet were giving more spotlight to 2  mcs from bgs that are basically ZB1â€™s competition rather than the mc that comes from the group under their company from their survival show. Like idc if heâ€™s not my bias Iâ€™d rather have mca be the hanbin show than the jaehyun and sohee show. Also the waiting room live is a shame they donâ€™t have female idols but I get why, like no company is going to say yes to it and risk dating rumors.</p>
