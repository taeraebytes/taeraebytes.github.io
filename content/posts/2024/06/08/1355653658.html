      <p>i'm shit at using instagram so idk what function this is, just saw it in the zb1 discord server, but on jiwoong's account apparently there's a "shared other account" under the username eeeebbbb2024 and i searched the username on twitter to see if anyone was talking about it and apparently there have been loads of ppl with zb1 related (i assume fans?) profiles following it and that it posted something on it's story in february so i'm like 😭 ??? seen ppl saying it could be his old art account which would make sense with it being connected to his official account, since it was active i guess it was probably hacked? but i had like a mini freak out being like "no way jiwoong was secretly connecting with fans through a second account" LMAO</p>

      <p>There's no way if he was secretly communicating with fans he would've got chopped to pieces but idk the whole situation is rlly weird I wish we knew more about what was going on cuz I'm so uneasy rn

      <p>same anon, searched panicrose and this came up which is like that person in the eeeebbbb2024 search saying that there was an english question posted on his story so maybe it really is his old art account? it has 500 less followers now tho so did ppl unfollow it or what
