      <p>gunwook is really just that one guy that was blessed with a broad ass frame but if you pay attention to him for more than three seconds heâ€™s literally just tall and broad and well proportioned like i know he goes to the gym once or twice a month and it shows occasionally and also the fact that heâ€™s always hanging around lanky ass gyuvin</p>

      <p>No like I say this all the time he has such a tea broad frame and it rlly tricks people into thinking he's muscular when he's not even top 3 in the groupðŸ˜­ but his proportions are the best like no extremes and amazing balance
