      <p>Actually no. To your guys surprises it's only riyangis complaing, rukidans actually like him bulking/ working out and they're mocking riyangis crying about losing their 'babygirl' ðŸ˜­ they fucking hate it when those specific riyangis call him babygirl/ princess and always pushing the delicate girl of the group who can't lift a finger persona on Ricky. 

The thing about face changing is they're mainly concerned he's only focused on doing weights (which he is not) and weightlifters solely focus on weights and do not do any cardio at all so weightlifters are known to have a bulkier/ chizzled face which they do not like. But Ricky seems to be only lifting his own weight and he's an idol so he does plenty of cardio so he'll be fine and just reassuring fans. But yeah surprisingly Rukidans are really happy with him right now the only people tweaking are again those babygirl riyangis. Good tweak. WE DON'T FUCKING WANT YOUUUUU</p>
