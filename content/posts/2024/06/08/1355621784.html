      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean itâ€™s only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>

      <p>I donâ€™t want this to come across the wrong way so let me firstly say im asking this as a genuine question because im not in either of these sf so I donâ€™t know what the overall consensus is. But in terms of jobs I mean aside from his mc job I always thought both got similar jobs. Both attend brand events, both have had an ost, both have not gotten a solo magazines so i actually do wonder aside from the mc thing which unfortunately only has 1 spot anyway (unless they donâ€™t renew the other two and add some zb1 members) what do you want ?</p>

      <p>Are you guys aware that Zhang Hao is a Kpop idol working in Korea but he is not promoted in Korea and his projects are mostly in China? How is he supposed to build a name in Korea if the comoany won't help him promote in Korea? Hanbin is appearing in Public weekly while Hao can only appear during group promotions... His song isn't even credited under his name.</p>
