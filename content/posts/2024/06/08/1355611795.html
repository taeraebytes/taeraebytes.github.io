      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean itâ€™s only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>

      <p>Maybe Iâ€™m just remembering wrong but as a whole I never remembered any of the past produce groups I stanned having as many solo or unit jobs as zb1 do. Even the po1, like it was majority whole group schedules and Iâ€™d say the solo stuff took offf after disbandment like I was a wizone and Iâ€™d actually disagree if you said wonyoung was getting premium treatment in terms of jobs because for things like variety ect it was mainly yena and yujin and aside from that they didnâ€™t do much that current zb1 members do. Even photoshoots like group ones were way more common that solo or units.</p>
