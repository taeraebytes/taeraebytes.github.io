      <p>gyuvins ass wants to get dragged so bad. what do you mean you went to yuehua and met up with the ceo and staffs... and youre talking about this on plus chat live... i have never seen a behaviour like this from any of the other produce groups. how is he already so blatently talking about a future he has no idea of. he will become that groups dozen too, hell the ceo of yuehua might not even let him debut üòë he needs to fucking stop talking about yuehua</p>
