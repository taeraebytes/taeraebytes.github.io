      <p>Hao can only sellout when rosins can mass buy. Even if Line did order more stock for Hao there's a limit as to how many items one person can buy, I think it was two item limit and that's why he's not selling out because now it's not 1 person buying 100 items, you now need 50 individuals in order to sell 100 items. Just some simple math. 

That's why mass buying can delude an entire fandom and brands, because brands saw all those numbers rosins were pulling because of mass buying so now that there's a limit if Hao doesn't sell out it's just gonna be an embarrassment and the brand questioning his legitimacy with popularity. Sorry I said what I said but it's facts.</p>
