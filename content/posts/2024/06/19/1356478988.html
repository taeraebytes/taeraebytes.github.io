      <p>I'm really curious does hanbin not give any feedback to gyuvin? like he supposedly watches and monitors their stages and "individual fancams" and wakeone never misses a chance to insert that in every content and I've seen him give feedback to every member but I've never seen him with gyuvin unless they're doing some corny 2binz shit that no one cares about. I remember when he set him up BADLY with that siren dance so gyuvin took all the heat and got dragged so bad even when hanbin himself was mid doing that dance</p>

      <p>i remember watching the fancam for their run run cover and whenever it was gyuvin's turn to sing hanbin would turn towards him all wide eyed nodding and smiling coaching him through his part like a kindergarten teacher backstage at his student's first recital. i think he's aware of how gyuvin is but it's way too much of an undertaking to try to make him good like with how busy they are they have to settle for decent and as long as he's not fully fucking up parts of the performance it's fine 😭😭 

on boys planet one of the trainers (i think solji) said something like, if you're not good at something you need to know exactly where you're at so you can improve but hanbin doesn't seem the type of person to outright tell someone they suck especially since it seems like gyuvin is doing as well as he's capable of at the moment. that's what annoys me with the more lacking members in the group, if they didn't make it in they could have had some REAL training time so they could actually improve but now they're too busy and I doubt that wakeone is providing trainers like that for them anyway. like imagine what yujin would be capable of if he had a couple more years to train</p>

      <p>😭😭😭😭😭 he's like a soft pageant mom but yea they rush their cb preparations and don't train or take outsourced classes so improvement comes slow ugh I wish they'd be in classes at least in these dry periods. Yea I rlly wish they could all see their full potentials but at least we've reached a stage where we're not worried ab real fuck ups we can't win everything I guess

      <p>I feel like we all have a friend like gyuvin too where it's like you love them and they love you SO much and are so clingy you don't want to hurt them but it makes having serious discussions difficult because even if they don't react badly they are very fragile, Gyuvin IS trying the hard truth is he should've never debuted so unready to begin with but this is gen the best he got like he felt confident w siren cause he gen thought wow I've improved 😭that's also why Hanbin (and hao tbh) feel more comfortable criticising gunwook cause they see him more as an equal for gyuvin it's like I know you're really trying and hurting because of this so I just want to support you</p>

      <p>No yea I get what you mean i also wanna note on the fact that we're talking in terms of zb1 I always feel like ppl take our criticism so generally like we're aware most of gyuvins peers are at the same level as him or shittier I just hate when ppl twist shit but I 100% agree and yea I get that it's easier to criticize someone like gunwook but they can chill on that😒 they need an actual teacher like ideky hanbin is heir dance teacher rn they need a professional who can deliver actual criticism
