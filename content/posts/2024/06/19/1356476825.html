      <p>im too lazy to search but in one zepisode or w.e where they were dancing to kiof in the corner in their practice room u can hear ricky say something about going to canada to matthew right when matthew and gunwook walks towards the camera. it was the only thing i understood in that entire episode cause it was in english so I just always remembered it ðŸ˜­

i think its possible he is in canada cause its so suss, matthew been quiet ever since the day all the other members were spotted whether at the airport, out or at least they went on mchat.
