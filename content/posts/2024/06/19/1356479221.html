      <p>Don't you all assume we hate gunwook because we are jealous and because of requeefiem. But I would say it was because I never liked other members and with very few content of the duo together, I definitely never cared about gunwook and got mad earlier when you shitted on hanbin. But since Hanbin has been talking a lot about gunwook recently, I came to like him too. I don't even care if gunwook does the same.</p>
