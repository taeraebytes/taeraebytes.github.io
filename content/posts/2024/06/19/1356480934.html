      <p>Fully diamond embedded, Girl can we do this for gunwook as well,  frankly speaking it's weird that only member is getting gift how bad other would feel like  😞 
Let me know your thoughts we will do fundraising for gunwook as well.

      <p>not really hanbin kfans got him another mic it took like a month to fund and add another month or two for getting it ready, same goes for yujin so he can get one before the concert 

Ricky cfans are also trying for a mic because the previous one is infamous af idk if he will even get it or use it honestly</p>
