      <p>getting a little sick of the amount of merch and magazine covers like can we get some gigs that give the whole group exposure and recognition (not just one member) ðŸ˜• that's what they need the most but it feels like well wk1 wants to do is milk the fans dry and make the most profit off of the group before it disbands like why are they alr giving up on them</p>
