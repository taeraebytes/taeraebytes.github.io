      <p>I hope this doesn't come across as me being disappointed but I'm a little surprised and curious as to why there's no Ricky and especially hao2binz trip picsü§îare their ssngs gatekeeping because they know they will be badly received?  I expected them to be followed everywhere</p>

      <p>No I get u like excuse me we wanna be on the trip tooü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but Ricky was seen on the plane to Shanghai by a non fan and she said there was no fans no staff so it's a private trip to Shanghai and he doesn't go out so no one's gonna see him I feel like fans will try to follow him on his way back to korea tho

      <p>Seriously and I also know for a fact some fans are in jeju rn FOR them specifically and there's fans in shanghai too lol I think they're gatekeeping and probably only sharing through gcs, for the civilians repos kfans usually wait for a few days before spreading them</p>

      <p>But fansites usually post pics literally same day or even only a few hours after they do something abroad or jeju or something. How come there are no previews</p>
