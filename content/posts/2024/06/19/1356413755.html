      <p>I'm really curious does hanbin not give any feedback to gyuvin? like he supposedly watches and monitors their stages and "individual fancams" and wakeone never misses a chance to insert that in every content and I've seen him give feedback to every member but I've never seen him with gyuvin unless they're doing some corny 2binz shit that no one cares about. I remember when he set him up BADLY with that siren dance so gyuvin took all the heat and got dragged so bad even when hanbin himself was mid doing that dance</p>

on boys planet one of the trainers (i think solji) said something like, if you're not good at something you need to know exactly where you're at so you can improve but hanbin doesn't seem the type of person to outright tell someone they suck especially since it seems like gyuvin is doing as well as he's capable of at the moment. that's what annoys me with the more lacking members in the group, if they didn't make it in they could have had some REAL training time so they could actually improve but now they're too busy and I doubt that wakeone is providing trainers like that for them anyway. like imagine what yujin would be capable of if he had a couple more years to train</p>
