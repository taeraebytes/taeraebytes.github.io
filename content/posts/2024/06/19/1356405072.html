      <p>I honestly see them staying where they are now which is better than continuing down. I feel like most of my pessimism has subsided but I think there's hope for better with a really good song and good enough marketing but debut will remain as their peak. Fortunately the fandom is still big so I think we'll keep breaking the 1st day 1mil album record sales and the intl side is getting bigger wakeone just has to give them something great to work with I used to pray on swing but where are they nowü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just don't want to lose them to tours and japan

      <p>i think the fandom will keep growing each comeback but they‚Äôre never going to have a big boom and the growth would be pretty small rather than steep (kind of like how ateez is. they‚Äôve been a group for 6 years and they sell well but even riize passed them in peak spotify listeners they don‚Äôt have reach outside their fandom and will most likely never have a hit song in their careers)</p>
