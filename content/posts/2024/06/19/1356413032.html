      <p>brah when I tell you I haven't seen a group of fans that token stans and glazes someone new every week in a whileeeeee I just saw allins starting to token stan ricky after the sudden increase in binrik influx and then they stopped mentioned ricky when they saw he was trending a lot in those k-forums they love so much and just a few days ago were dragging him because they had a fight with riyangis over the birthday posts and said only 2binz is the acceptable hanbin duo 😭😭 well no shit that's cause gyuvin is a spineless loser who worships your fav and his stans aren't that many or gaf to tell y'all to stop token stanning him besides he doesn't threaten hanbin in any way 😭 just an embarrassing bunch</p>

      <p>gyuvin has 2 brothers and a sister, LOVES mango to death, does not drink he hates it even cut off friendship with a high school friend for it, went cycling very often either by himself or with members, a fan of his recovered from depression thanks to him and became a psychotherapist he felt touched and has been thinking about it for a few days bc it gave him motivation to get through the day. how did i do? i'm not anon but idk why gyuvin's fans always reduce him to a token stan when some fans genuinely love him even if he ain't our bias</p>
