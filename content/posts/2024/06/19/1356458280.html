      <p>Yujin solo Magazine cover and still nothing for Zhang Hao when it's approaching one year into his debut as ZB1 Center... Daniel got his solo cover just few months after debut. Matthew even got a solo cover before him. And now Yujin. And Hao's birthday month is in July. I'm worried about the noise that this would bring in the tl. WK1 is really frustrating sometimes. They want to ruin the fandom so much. ðŸ˜­</p>
