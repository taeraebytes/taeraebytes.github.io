Yujin has a soft visual, and Yujin can really step up if boys take a nice shower with shampoo since his hair looks greasy af i can sense it from photos.

He really shines in photocover; he needs a good moisturizer because his skin is dry as hell, and the kid isn't drinking water, but Yujin's visuals are better; in fact, he definitely needs some grooming tips from Ricky; he looks clean, whereas Yujin appears to have arrived at the fan event without showering or moisturizing his face.",
