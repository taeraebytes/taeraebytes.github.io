      <p>This is a general question because I wasn't around during bp but I've always been curious what role forums like pann, dc, instiz, etc played during the show? Did they matter or was twitter where everything really happened</p>

      <p>The constant posts on pann showed ppl cared but they were cussing gwk too much for my liking. But lowkey they pushed Ricky to the majority of viewers. Instiz idc and dc didn't have much influence, they were hating on taerae who at point had so much support. Dc inside is like the only forum to find Korean opinions for shows not popular in Korea like runext or iland2, but boys planet was already heavily discussed on Twitter and pann</p>

      <p>Dc is where events and stats are organised and predictions are made, they even start a lot of discussions but it's usually negative and hate based. I was in daegu at the bp final time and made a post there to give my opinions after going to see the final in the theatres and they filled my comments with hate cause I said I was a junhyeon stan</p>

      <p>Original anon I mean I feel it was more fun in Seoul, most of the ppl there were haobin fans and nobody did the grimace to jongwoo or keita so unfortunately I don't have that funny clipðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­  I was sat next to a quiet kid matthew fan and a male kamden fan, he was defo gay and had high hopes he would get in I could only sigh for him when he started crying.</p>
