      <p>Diff anon and u really saw none of what was happening on the kside? I thought lotus would know if anything ðŸ˜­ I just checked my bookmarks and they all got deleted because it got ratio'd and these went viral with like 10k+ qrts each, millions of views and it was basically kbrice saying how cute it is that rice is so quiet and have no reaction but they got ratioed in the qrts by knets and the qrts got even more traction it was so bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Here's one of the qrts about rice not reacting to jaehyun who was promoting their song but rice gave nothing and it was just silence

      <p>Yeah it was so bad I think one of the most ratio'd one got 20k qrts the last time I saw it and it was when Jaehyun was dancing but rice was not reacting at all so then jaehyun just looked like a fool and knets felt sorry for him because, I know we hate him here but he was genuinely trying to make daechinso w.e it's called as entertaining as possible with what was given which was basically 6 walls ðŸ˜­ I mean sohee kinda tried but jaehyun always had to initiate, it was just a bad time</p>

      <p>But that tweet did have a lot of  ppl exaggerating, like lotus said they did just look confused when he was going to end. The actual worse one is when Jaehyun promoted them and they didn't give any reaction. Like that one was lowkey rude cause he was just talking about how amazing they were at everything and they just didn't do anything. Like it's a given for them to be complimented that one did rub me off the wrong way. Shotaro really pushes himself, sohee some he's just much more comfortable to watch now he's a mc. Wb and anton it's just innate autism but the remaining two are big headed asf</p>

      <p>wonbin is interesting because how did even Taerae who previously said he won't leave until he befriends people and somehow befriended that one introverted shy guy from boy next door say he didn't talk to wonbin at all bc he seemed to introverted and didn't want to disturb him lmao</p>

      <p>wonbin is if an 8 year old child was trapped in a 22 year olds body heâ€™s genuinely terrified of everything his social anxiety is so bad he canâ€™t even order his own food the other members have to do it for him. he does speak a lot his ass canâ€™t stop talking but only when heâ€™s with people heâ€™s familiar with. if heâ€™s not heâ€™s practically mute</p>
