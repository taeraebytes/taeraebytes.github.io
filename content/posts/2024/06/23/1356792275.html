      <p>Debatable. Hanbin and jungkook both have their strengths and weaknesses and I would say are on the same level but I always like to give more credit to jungkook because he's just raw talent and has basically had no vocal lessons since debut till now and sings purely on instinct it could be the same for hanbin but I think I've heard him mention that he has taken singing lessons ive never heard jungkook say the same</p>

      <p>That's subjective hanbins whole shtick is that he tries to sound pretty to hear and he does so I'm sure a lot of people would disagree including me but when hes actually singing properly he's ahead of quite a few vocalists in 4th/5th gen boys</p>

      <p>That's true but idk he's just too light it is subjective but the assumed better vocalist would be jungkook just cuz of his popularity the parts he sings and that fuller pop voice

      <p>y'all are gonna disagree but I think Hanbin can do a live performance better than jk and only judging with the little ZB1 content we have like he can keep up good and jk just like bts as a whole has never gagged me live</p>

      <p>Even if that was true (it's not I would say that's one of the only things jungkook has over other vocalists is his stable singing just let him have this damn) that still wouldn't make hanbin a better vocalist we've had this discussion here before but better stability=/=better vocalist</p>
