      <p>Gunwook needs to be paired up with gyujin more (taerae works too but they don't have much chemistry) bcs since matthaobin are the most biased members gunwook is more like an accessory or a side character to them, it works for gyuvin cause it's what he markets himself as but gunwook has too much mc energy</p>

      <p>ndnenfndnfmdkkfmf yea gunwook can't not be the mc of the show and I hate when ppl try to make him the third wheel like he's not leading üòí but I'd love more content with them too but riyangis ruined it for us

      <p>Riwook is kinda amongst my top duos actually but I'm kinda worried gunwook would get the gyuvin or mattwook treatment of being the male blank role to Rickys female mc projection role so for now I want gyuwook and gunjin moreüò≠</p>

      <p>so far Ricky fans don't even rate the duo and the ones who do are pretty aight about it I haven't seen it bastardized yet so maybe there's hope but I like the other two just as much
