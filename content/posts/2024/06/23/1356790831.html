      <p>Please no, variety shows are not it, they arent what they used to be especially if its gonna be a group episode. Their best hope is to really push one of them, potentiallly ricky, as a cute and funny foreigner role like Tsuki, shes not even that funny but she‚Äôs just well pushed by her company and cute. At least one member has to stick in the variety world, and I think it could be ricky</p>

      <p>ricky needs someone to bounce off of sorry he cant be pushed alone but also it has to help the group like tsukkis building a name but we dont got time for all that we need units strategically sent out

      <p>Im not even a Ricky fan but I see him being able to attract people with his looks and he‚Äôs only limited bc of language but isnt shy. He‚Äôs really someone who stands out and thats more important. I‚Äôll rather him than units, units are so common for variety shows and doesnt peak interest unless they are already famous. Also when the members r together as a unit they are less likely to be given a chance to be funny and they just complete the games and move on.</p>

      <p>sorry i just cant see it hes not shy but hes not that outspoken either? like when i think of a foreign variety character jackson wang comes to mind like the facilities arent there and im sorry thats stupid so ricky can bring attention but not a unit üò≠? like i said hes good when he has someone to bounce off of i dont think hes gonna bode well by himself especially as the only foreigner

      <p>do ppl even know ricky like? üò≠üò≠ dude doesn‚Äôt even speak well in his own mother tongue and u think he‚Äôd strive alone? even together he doesn‚Äôt do too well. look at the most recent zb1 folder when they were asked to say some words to the member beside them, and ricky got like A WORD out to yujin and worse, that was a kdrama character‚Äôs name like???? yall‚Äôs overestimation go crazy</p>

      <p>I was wondering if Ricky wasn't as good at mandarin anymore since he's known English since he wa a kid and moved away but I gotta watch I feel like he's really good when he's being outspoken but that's not always

      <p>wait does anon even know ricky? I dont know him well but just from watching zb1 stuff ricky and yujin been memeing tf out of queen of tears and thats their inside joke so idk what anon is trying to prove by saying ricky called him a kdrama character. ricky and yuijns relationship isnt really based off words or expressing 'love' through words they do it via memes and doing stupid stuff together and thats what ricky did in zb1 folder üò≠</p>

      <p>yeah they keep memeing it or reciting queen of tears lines whenever they can like thats just how they vibe and bond üò≠ I kinda got a good idea of the type of person ricky was when the zb1 anniversary vid when gunwook was reading his letter and ppl were getting emotional but then ricky had to break the tension by saying he didnt use papago and made everyone laugh. he just aint the type to use words and rather express it by making ppl laugh and yea he bounces of ppl really well</p>

      <p>i feel like he can bounce off mc's / variety cast members too tbh and not just the members dkm üò≠  I mean even the old gremlin myungsoo went to choke him on his show and he was bouncing off that one kid on hello82 pretty good</p>

      <p>diff anon but am I the only one who sees the riwook variety potential?!??!?! Both are good at variety for different reasons, Gunwook is quick, witty and logical with his responses and Ricky is more meme-y and he isn't afraid to jump in and give his two cents into a convo even though he's a foreigner. They cover the areas where one lacks in so their balance is so good and both are competitive when need be like wakeone send them to something PLASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</p>
