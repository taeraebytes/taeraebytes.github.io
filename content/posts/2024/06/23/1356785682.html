      <p>neither of them is true but astrology is fake science while taro is more of a spiritual thing so whatever you itâ€™s just find coolerâ€¦ but ik girls in my country who make a really good living doing both and it is crazy to me that people actually pay a lot of money for those things ðŸ˜­</p>
