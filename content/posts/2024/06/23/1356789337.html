      <p>no like i'm being serious he used to be my bias when i was into bts and exols were always trying to drag him by comparing him to their main vocalists so i used to watch a lot of video analysis on 3rd gen main vocalists and jungkook is an incredible vocalist, he uses a similar breathy technique to hanbin but he's miles better obviously and has an amazing falsetto and those adlibs used to carry every bts song ever so dont even disrespect him ever again previous anon this used to be my king!</p>
