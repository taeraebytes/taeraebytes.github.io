      <p>I feel like since it's hard to make group lives wakeone should do trio lives like this like we can have mattraewoong riwookjin and hao2binz mattraewoong will give us the very in your face yaoi bait, riwookjin will be a comedic trio where they roast eachother and crack a lot of jokes and hao2binz will be messy as hell cause all three have the tendency to judt say shit when they're tweaking or too lit and they'll be extra comfortable since they're together so like I see the chaos potential</p>
