      <p>the way i rarely if ever deepen anything idols do or say like sometimes y'all do too much with the analysis but I do agree that it's been weird how much gyuvin mentions and posts Haobin these days... I know he's been close to Hanbin for a while but the boom with Hao and with Haobin as a duo is sooooooo suspicious I feel like he's either doing it bc they have some schedule coming up so he's spoiling it or he's just really trying to leech and make them a solid trio (nobody asked for)</p>
