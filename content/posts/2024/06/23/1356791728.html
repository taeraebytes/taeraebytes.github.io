      <p>It's jungkook if anyone cares about the technicalities but the gap is not that big and gunwook is quite ambitious with his singing which is not a good thing imo but it can make him seem better than jungkook sometimes because jungkook sticks to what he knows and does it good</p>

      <p>Yes to the last part kinda hes singing notes that he does not know how to sing with healthy and proper technique sometimes it was evident in his monster cover and he also unrelated idk if he's ever had vocal lessons I don't think he has but considering the levels he's at he's got a very good grip but just gets too confident with it but it's good that he's trying at least he should probably hit up taerae and hao on how to get better and as the same thing I said about hanbin he's ahead of quite a few people in the newer gens regardless</p>

      <p>Yea he hasn't before he's only ever done company training but I think on a live a few days ago when he was talking ab the live request video he said he started vocal lessons I'm p sure but I hope he seeks out the growth he has so much potential
