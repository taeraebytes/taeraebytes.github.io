      <p>These pairs minus shimkongz aren't even paired this much tbh they're just the popular ships üò≠ but for other pairs I suggest 
Jiwoong Taerae (don't get angry taerae fans it's cause he's probably his closest friends rn I prefer mattrae)
For Hao I actually only really like chemistry with twobinz tbh but for something new let's go w matthao 
Hanbin Gunwook! We hear them talk about talking w eo a lot so I'm curious about their discussions 
Ricky Yujin I think they'd be super entertaining 
Gyuvin can join any of these pairs but let's out him w taerae and jiwoong for a change

Idk I still prefer the trios I sent earlier</p>
