      <p>As an exol I'm gonna have to put my opinions on this.

Mathew xiumin, matches quite well, cute but muscle babies. Talented but overlooked? But Mathew is extroverted and xiumin isnt.

Gunwook kai ðŸ’¯ flirt, dance members, can rap and sing. Strong stage presence but big shy cuties off stage like teddy bears (they're representative animals!!!) 

Hanbin suho....hmm I think the only thing in common is that they're both leaders and whose visual is loved by the kfans. 

Hao baekhyun, they're quite similar. Mbti isfp,  main vocals who are great performers. Funny in a weird way (bh is crazier) witty and smart! A bit careless and are confident.

Taerae....well he doesnt have that much similarity with either chen or do except for chen's temper and whines and do's bluntness.

Ricky is NOT chanyeol, he is either lay or even tao

Yujin sehun. they are similar too. Spoiled brats who are one of the main stan attractors. Cfans fave visual</p>
