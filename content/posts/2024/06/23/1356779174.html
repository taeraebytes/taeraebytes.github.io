      <p>Shivio is not on Twitter and is taking a sabbatical, especially since Skz began witch hunting when she predicted that Hyunjin should be more mindful of his friend group, and after a few days, we had the Han Seohee incident. They accused her of voodoo and black magic.</p>

      <p>I'm afraid because she foresaw another Jiwoong-level controversy in ZB1. It's probably some past where brings out, or a third party will generate the choas. RIIZE is also facing increased controversy in the second half of the year, which will harm the group's reputation. TXT will face a larger scandal than ZB1 and RIIZE combined, and one person will leave the squad as a result.</p>
