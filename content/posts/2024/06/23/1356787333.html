      <p>I'll never get your beef with gunrae ðŸ˜­ gw adores him and thinks tr is cute and tr always hypes gw and has been getting closer with him by gaming and hanging out with him let the beef go ðŸ˜­ just because kfans ship them doesn't mean they aren't cute as a duo (not as a ship)</p>

      <p>NFNFJJDKCKKD BITCH? it doesn't help that Matthew isn't popular in korea but postype is also not the best marker because gunhao is a huge ship on twitter but I don't think it has that many fics
