      <p>I just don't get sm, when Sungchan got into nct they favored him forth and back. They got him a deal with some skincare brand and an inkigayo gig. Then when riize finally debuted they were like nah we don't give a fuck about you and left him with nothing like not even the visual title ðŸ˜­.</p>
