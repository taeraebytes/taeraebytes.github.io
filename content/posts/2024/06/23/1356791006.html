      <p>the way i rarely if ever deepen anything idols do or say like sometimes y'all do too much with the analysis but I do agree that it's been weird how much gyuvin mentions and posts Haobin these days... I know he's been close to Hanbin for a while but the boom with Hao and with Haobin as a duo is sooooooo suspicious I feel like he's either doing it bc they have some schedule coming up so he's spoiling it or he's just really trying to leech and make them a solid trio (nobody asked for)</p>

      <p>ok leave us alone we're tweakers and we're bored but also this is rlly how I just interpret thingsðŸ˜’ but no gyuvin always does this he's done it with Ricky and he's done it with hanbin alone he's just trying to build himself up rn there's no schedule that would have him acting like this and this prolonged
