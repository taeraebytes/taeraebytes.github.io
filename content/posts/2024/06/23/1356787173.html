      <p>Tarot is card reading and astrology has to do with the stars they're not the same

      <p>neither of them is true but astrology is fake science while taro is more of a spiritual thing so whatever you itâ€™s just find coolerâ€¦ but ik girls in my country who make a really good living doing both and it is crazy to me that people actually pay a lot of money for those things ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>My sister is big into astrology and she can be scary accurate like I had to move country for a job and she told me to be careful cause everything will feel hazy and dreamlike there and to be careful about drugs alcohol etc and I actually had my drink drugged there it was scary but usually it's good for personality but to predict the future it's not that good cause you can interpret it in too many ways</p>

      <p>Not to be the debby downer but if u need an astrology reader to tell you to be careful with ur drinks getting spiked I think u need help ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Everyone should know to be careful no matter what country like it's common sense and you've probably been told by peers, family and friends and tiktok to be careful but never payed attention tbh ðŸ˜­</p>
