      <p>Debatable. Hanbin and jungkook both have their strengths and weaknesses and I would say are on the same level but I always like to give more credit to jungkook because he's just raw talent and has basically had no vocal lessons since debut till now and sings purely on instinct it could be the same for hanbin but I think I've heard him mention that he has taken singing lessons ive never heard jungkook say the same</p>
