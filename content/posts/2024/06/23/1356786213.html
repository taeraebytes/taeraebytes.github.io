      <p>acting like gunwook wasnâ€™t the first member to appear on haoâ€™s bubble, actually the member that appeared most, like he didnâ€™t call him sweetheart, like they dont speak cutely to eo, like he doesnâ€™t adore gunwook like have u never heard him say gonukie??? this is a wholesome and adorable friendship where they can still exist independently from eo w no any type of fanservice moments. GUNWOOK WILL ALWAYS WIN OVER SLEAZY GYUVIN ðŸ«µ</p>
