      <p>Baby, that's one fan who is literally blocked by even wonbin fandom, he target numerous idols like hao with sinophobic tweet giselle and other idol, let me tell you one thing, that account is a previous hanbin account, I came from Biscoff account, you all love to demonize us. At least we don't kill each other over petty positions. I'm sorry if it comes out to be rude but you all needs to stop stereotyping whole fandom based on action of few, I feel like zerose are giving fuel to this shit</p>
