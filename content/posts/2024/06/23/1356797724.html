      <p>That's not why people disliked her, people disliked her bc she went behind her back and said that while every other contestant was there except her. Then one of the other girls was like why didn't you tell her then? And she started giggling as some kind of bully. 

Also, it's not like Sujung is a singer either. like if this was jiyoon I would at least get it but it's Sujung who also has weak vocals</p>
