      <p>Please no, variety shows are not it, they arent what they used to be especially if its gonna be a group episode. Their best hope is to really push one of them, potentiallly ricky, as a cute and funny foreigner role like Tsuki, shes not even that funny but sheâ€™s just well pushed by her company and cute. At least one member has to stick in the variety world, and I think it could be ricky</p>

      <p>ricky needs someone to bounce off of sorry he cant be pushed alone but also it has to help the group like tsukkis building a name but we dont got time for all that we need units strategically sent out
