      <p>Please no, variety shows are not it, they arent what they used to be especially if its gonna be a group episode. Their best hope is to really push one of them, potentiallly ricky, as a cute and funny foreigner role like Tsuki, shes not even that funny but sheâ€™s just well pushed by her company and cute. At least one member has to stick in the variety world, and I think it could be ricky</p>

      <p>ricky needs someone to bounce off of sorry he cant be pushed alone but also it has to help the group like tsukkis building a name but we dont got time for all that we need units strategically sent out

      <p>Im not even a Ricky fan but I see him being able to attract people with his looks and heâ€™s only limited bc of language but isnt shy. Heâ€™s really someone who stands out and thats more important. Iâ€™ll rather him than units, units are so common for variety shows and doesnt peak interest unless they are already famous. Also when the members r together as a unit they are less likely to be given a chance to be funny and they just complete the games and move on.</p>

      <p>sorry i just cant see it hes not shy but hes not that outspoken either? like when i think of a foreign variety character jackson wang comes to mind like the facilities arent there and im sorry thats stupid so ricky can bring attention but not a unit ðŸ˜­? like i said hes good when he has someone to bounce off of i dont think hes gonna bode well by himself especially as the only foreigner
