      <p>I feel like since it's hard to make group lives wakeone should do trio lives like this like we can have mattraewoong riwookjin and hao2binz mattraewoong will give us the very in your face yaoi bait, riwookjin will be a comedic trio where they roast eachother and crack a lot of jokes and hao2binz will be messy as hell cause all three have the tendency to judt say shit when they're tweaking or too lit and they'll be extra comfortable since they're together so like I see the chaos potential</p>

      <p>Idk cause Hanbin is super careful and anxious but he sometimes does stuff where I'm like ???the baekyeon ai stuff is the first thing that comes to mind but it's been several instances where I was like I thought you of all people thought before you speak ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­also I feel like jjangyuz are the two people where their approval and humour is more important than his fans so he would start getting too comfortable ughhh the amount of discourse and controversy a trio live would bring now I really need it</p>

      <p>I always got why haobin are popular even I moved during the finale or for naughty etc they look good together so I wouldn't be mad if they got duo schedules
As a trio though? I don't see it either but it's funny cause I don't care about haobin as individuals while I loooive gyuvin ðŸ˜­but I feel like his relationship with them brings the worst in him like gyuvin is at his best when he's light casual genuine fun and heartwarming but with haobin it's HIGH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS TUMBLR POETRY emotions all the time and it's like damn calm downðŸ˜­</p>
