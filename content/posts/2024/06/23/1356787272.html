      <p>I‚Äôm late to the discussion but since BP Familyz has always been haobin and Gyuvin Yujin. People bastardized that shit to haobinjin because it‚Äôs the trio that was always paired together. Gyuvin is coming for what was his since the beginning</p>

      <p>nahhhh you‚Äôre lying. familyz has always been haobinjin cos of their similar visuals. ifans only wanted to add gyuvin to the mix cos of 2binz (and gyujin cos it was the early days of debut where the dickriding yj era was ongoing)</p>
