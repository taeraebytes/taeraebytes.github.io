      <p>I'll never get your beef with gunrae ðŸ˜­ gw adores him and thinks tr is cute and tr always hypes gw and has been getting closer with him by gaming and hanging out with him let the beef go ðŸ˜­ just because kfans ship them doesn't mean they aren't cute as a duo (not as a ship)</p>

      <p>because they honestly don't interact much and barely lean into the yaoi fanservice (esp. tr doesn't want anything to do with this at all ðŸ˜­) but their rps archive has over 3k followers and whenever they do anything that isn't just standing next to each other their tweets pull 500 likes in average they're definitely one of the mid tier ships size wise and growing</p>

      <p>That's one  of the big reasons guntael is so big, cause taerae is clingy with other young guys like gyuvin but doesn't do that to gunwook. It's one of the main plots of their fics where gunwook is jealous about that</p>
