      <p>I'll never get your beef with gunrae ðŸ˜­ gw adores him and thinks tr is cute and tr always hypes gw and has been getting closer with him by gaming and hanging out with him let the beef go ðŸ˜­ just because kfans ship them doesn't mean they aren't cute as a duo (not as a ship)</p>

      <p>koreans donâ€™t like matthew it ainâ€™t happening anon also the appeal for geontael is the antithesis of geonmaet and even gyubgeon sorry queefy they really like the hesitant church hyung and clingy puppy younger appeal</p>

      <p>but why is it yuck? because mattwook gets waaaaay worse when it comes to classic yaoi like it's literally all small whiny cute matthew and big strong possessive gunwook ðŸ˜­ this, funnily enough, barely happens for geontael tbh</p>

      <p>no the fuck it is not ugh you don't even understand the levels I WOULD NEVER TAP INTO A SHIP LIKE THAT TRUST!!! mattwook for me was that they were just openly affectionate and genuinely close when they started upping the fanservice it stays consistent and they rely on physical touch they never do none of that bs they're very sweet and nice wirh each other ugh what do u take me forðŸ˜’
