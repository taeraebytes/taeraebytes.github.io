      <p>Wait diff anon but I'm a rosin and I feel like nothing is super confirmedðŸ˜­ Some accs posted it but in c-ent lots of accs like to lie for fun & drop random names to gain hype for legit ba announcements. I would love for Hao to have loewe but other more likely names for ba have also been mentioned in gossip accs like Wang Yibo who's gonna be in paris this month during fashion week so nothing is for sure</p>

      <p>yea sorry idk a Loewe ba just seems soooo unlikely like it's seriously up there and he'd have to have a real prior influence for that and the relationship between hao and Loewe isn't even as strong as hanbin and gucci
