      <p>Yujin and Hao have always been close in a sort of quiet way. They're not same aged friends or anything and both are introverted, but Yujin has been close to Hao since Bp.</p>

      <p>They're close like brothers since Hao treats him like his baby brother and dotes on him a lot. They're just broadcasting what they have now. I do believe that Yuehua has to do with it. And I do believe that Ricky is the least favored member by Yuehua the way he's not in the formula</p>
