      <p>Apparently, Wakeone requested Hao because he can't just show up there randomly. He was requested to surprise Hanbin, for an unknown reason. The other 2 MCs knew about the surprise too so probably arranged by mnet and WK1. But Hao has to do everything on his own. Well, he's a grown man.</p>
