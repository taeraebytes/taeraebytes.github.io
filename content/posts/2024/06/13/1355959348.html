      <p>? Facial expression is hella important because you're trying to convey a story/ emotion and her emotion did not match w.e she was trying to convey which was sensual/ lust ðŸ˜­ But at the same time that's why there's dance crews like jabbawockeez however u spell it so u can soley focus on their dance and the mask is part of their concept.</p>
