      <p>Apparently, Wakeone requested Hao because he can't just show up there randomly. He was requested to surprise Hanbin, for an unknown reason. The other 2 MCs knew about the surprise too so probably arranged by mnet and WK1. But Hao has to do everything on his own. Well, he's a grown man.</p>

      <p>Why not the group? Why not Matthew, Hao and Gyuvin at least. Whenever Wakeone push Haobin, they need to sell something the next day.ðŸ¤£</p>

      <p>sell what? i'm ctfu zero critical thinking skills they see hao and hanbin in the same frame and it's definitely some conspiracy theories and master plan behind and not because maybe they're close friends, hanbin also mentioned in the live how hao gave him a cake and wished him hbd at night yesterday so did wakeone and mnet told hao to do that and told hanbin to mention it today? tell us you have no friends irl without actually telling us ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ please free these two boys from their akgaes</p>
