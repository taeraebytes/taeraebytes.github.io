      <p>ugh no i'm sorry i hate the pointy chin so bad like in boys planet his chin was more square and it looked fine??????? so i don't get why they had to change it. now it looks like the feature doesn't fit his face he looks like a god damn dorito. they need to take whatever that is out, fix the lips and stop giving him that white foundation like he's pale but he's not THAT pale. THEN he's sorted</p>

      <p>I noticed his chin can be pointy or rounder depending on the angle so sometimes I'm like does he even have chin fillers üò≠ because even in his pre debut teen pics it was pretty pointy and in some angles it was rounder just like now. Also he naturally just has a longer lower jaw so again depending on the angle it can make his chin look longer/ pointier esp when he takes selfies from above.</p>

      <p>I can attest to queef because I stalk his sis on a daily ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è His chin is naturally pointy just like his sister & your right anon he has a longer jaw so it can make his chin look even pointy-er in some angles and I like his chin too. You can tell it's not chin filler because it's not always pointy depending on angle.

I'm telling you guys if you guys just saw his sister all your plastic surgery/ filler assumptions will be gone. Same nose, same chin, same jaw, same shoulders (I used to accuse him of wearing shoulder pads LMAO until I saw she had the same sharp shoulders) and she's only 15 I've been stalking her since last year when she still had pics of her when she was 11-14.</p>

      <p>its the MAKEUP yall. i seem him recently and his jawline is DRAWN, it's crazy, especially when he doesn't point his chin out and slightly looks down and you look sideways at him, they really the mere drawing of a line on his face. I think he had some filler injected in his chin and also in the hollows under his cheekbones because I saw that after promoting for  crush, he was so skinny that his skin looked gray and sucking up and the hollows on his face were so obvious that they needed makeup to cover it up, that was when he was at his skinniest. 
And the fillers they used were probably cheap ass so they migrated and landed on his neck making it look like he had double chins and they contour the fuck out of it, now irl his chins is actually small  ( this might be controversial but his face shape is more oval, the one that have heart face shape are haobinmatt ) and he not that skinny anymore so they need to dissolve all the fillers and put down the contour</p>

      <p>another anon and no I don't think he gotten cheek fillers and I gen believe the first and last time he got chin fillers was for in bloom.

I noticed this with all the members not just ricky, during promos they're skinny af due to the hectic schedules and strict dieting to look good on the camera because its been known the camera adds 10 lbs. But as soon as promos are over they binge eat or just eat in general and when you go from a strict diet/ fluid diet or even not eating at all to suddenly eating a proper meal your body soaks up all that goodness and holds onto it because your body doesn't know if your going to go back to your calorie deficient state and in doing so it makes ur face suddenly bloat and it's why people would think they suddenly got cheek fillers after promos are over like anon said after crush promos but it's really just bloating because they're eating a proper meal after going through a strict diet. It's literally your body trying to hold onto everything in the form of water retention because they don't want you to die üò≠

And then award season came up and they were back to being skinny skinny again with hollow cheeks, if it were cheek fillers it would've never hollowed out like that again. Like this is not just a ricky thing it's with all members and idols but in zb1 I noticed hanbin and ricky are the ones where u can really notice when they're on a strict calorie deficient diet and when they're finally off it and are eating again because they have naturally higher cheekbones so the difference in hollowness/ fullness of their cheeks is more noticeable.

Sorry for word vomit, I don't know how ur anons feel about ed's so I wont go to deep, it's just I have personal experiences with this and binge eating and yoyoing so I could easily tell when someone is going through the same thing. So I'm glad ricky is gaining weight now and he looks much happier and healthier too.</p>

      <p>oh wow you actually answered üò≠ This is my first cc but I've been lurking for a long time and honestly thought you'd ignore because this cc was so long.

Also disclaimer I don't want to offend anybody, this is just my personal opinion because I actually got professional help and they explained everything to me, even dumbed it down so I'd actually understand what was going on when I did xyz and now my relationship with food is much more positive. How a consistent diet > on and off diet where you only go on a diet to lose weight quickly for an event, vocation or in our case comebacks. 

But even with a consistent diet sudden bloating can still occur because a lot of diets includes cheat days, where you follow your diet plan for 6 days and 1 day you get to eat whatever you want which for most people that would include foods heavy in sodium, carbs and sweets. So suddenly going from eating lean, clean and low carbs to a day filled with sodium, carbs and sugar your face and body would naturally bloat. It's why a lot of idols apologize for their face being bloated in the morning because they probably had a cheat day the previous day or broke their diet and had a midnight snack.

Imo just understanding the simple science in how food affects one body/ face can help the way you view food in general and how much an impact the food you eat can affect your appearance, and even help sympathize with idols because whether they're on a consistent diet or an on and off diet, both are hard af.
