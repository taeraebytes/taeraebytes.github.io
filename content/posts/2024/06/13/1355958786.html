      <p>yea idk where the conspiracies popped but those shots only brightens you to what you'd be naturally if you stayed indoors completely out of the sun for a year but those shots only fastens that progress. Skin pigment is genetics and part of your dna and those shots reduces melanin which is produced when you're exposed to the sun in order to protect you from the sun rays. 

If you guys see some idols who were hella tan back in the days and are now hella pale it's highly likely because they're naturally genetically that pale. There's so many things to consider like outdoor sports, not using sun protection etc which would make them tanner back then so now that they're practically indoors 24/7 and using sun protection they could also just naturally lose that tan without those shots.</p>
