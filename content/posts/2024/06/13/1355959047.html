      <p>wonyoung is just on a whole league of her own but whats stopping people fully stanning her is ive bc they are really not that interesting as a group while karina is coming for her title and have aespa to back her up which pushes her more. if aespa continues to get bigger, karina would easily surpass her</p>

      <p>I know it's over the top comparison, but look at it this way. Wonyoung is Gdragon. A brand you can put anywhere. Karina is Jaejoong. The one popular in idol world.</p>

      <p>he was literally caught smoking weed in the club in like 2015 I think? but he was pardoned then because it was before kr gov passed the law the that punished koreans who take drugs overseas. also the only reason why he was investigated for drugs here is because of that parasite actor. essentially he was attending the same brothel as he did and hung out with the owner woman who blackmailed the parasite actor. she gave the police the lead on gd. said that he would step outside of sometimes and come back rubbing his nose etc etc. I don't buy him not taking drugs, also he definitely paid for sex. his fans are delusional if they think he was a vip client at the brothel because he wanted to "drink and sing karaoke in privacy" like ðŸ’€</p>
