      <p>Gyuvin has patterns hao yujin and hui were some of the guys he would mention casually at least once in his lives but Hanbin was who he obsessed over especially when he got into controversies while he was always close to Ricky he also started talking obsessively and in length about Ricky when they started getting shipped internationally (I don't think gyuvin has ever had the desire to be shipped w anyone else the way he spoke about Hanbin vs Ricky is very different) nowadays he speaks about a whole lot more , its partially because they got closer im sure (as hao himself has said) and also partially because of the recent yuehua dinner probably, but there's been a shift and i think he specifically wants to get on rosins and zerocolas side too which i saw coming</p>

      <p>ouuu good analysis and yea the way he talks about hanbin and Ricky was different he was just doing pr with hanbin. But as he was always close to hao this is sooo different they rlly must have got told smth at that dinner he needs to have a cushion like how he did with yujin and finale ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>something i noticed is he started to talk abt ricky on lives and chat frequently again right after kcon hk. there were quite a few ppl w gyubrik signs there and he clearly saw and realized that he could still benefit from the shipping. it kinda worked too cuz now they have like legit chinese shippers who get them matching things, ask shipping questions and duo fansites</p>
