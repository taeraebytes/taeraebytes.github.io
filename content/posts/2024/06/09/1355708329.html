      <p>I know discussions here are about to get annoying so let's start talking about something else 

Let's talk about how gunwook is like one of the only few ACTUAL all rounders in kpop because half the people that people call all rounders in kpop are mostly all just good dancers and if we're lucky MAYBE a slightly decent vocalist none of them ever write their own raps or anything so the question of being a good rapper already gets dismissed the only person who I can think of that it really applies to rn other than him is woodz and even then gunwook is a better vocalist than him (but he does excel in other arenas more than him) if there's anyone else ppl here can point out i would loveee to talk about it</p>

      <p>The way I literally specified writing raps as criteria for being a rapper anon can you not read? 😑 Gunwook has literally rapped self written raps several times and if he was given the opportunity he would do it more</p>
