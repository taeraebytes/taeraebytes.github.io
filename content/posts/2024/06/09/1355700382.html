      <p>The difference is killling me cause didn’t gyuvin and Gunwook had back to back gigs not even a month ago. For gyuvin, he mced with yujin for a show (I forgot the name), then Atkinson, then the baseball gig, then music core mc all this while being the dozen of the group 

For gunwook, he got dingo, kcon japan mc, Atkinson, music core mc, baseball gig ALL of these were announced literally back to back that too in cb era which means wakeone was handing out gigs to these 2 specifically 

So suddenly why is tere such a difference in reaction when we all know damn well that hanbin is the most suited member for mcing iland and being on aotm like why are we even surprised ? It’s like you guys would rather see people from other groups get the gig than the member from your own group who IS THE BEST SUITED FOR these gigs. 

Also how is it back to September when literally every member except Jiwoong has gigs rn ? And hanbin isn’t even the one with the most gigs.</p>

      <p>They got them back to back while there was other active promotion and a baseball game isn't even close to the prestige of aotm or iland mcing are u stupid I literally said I don't rlly feel anything ab it the timing just sucks since we know it's going to be dead till the next cb likejfndndmmdmdm😭
