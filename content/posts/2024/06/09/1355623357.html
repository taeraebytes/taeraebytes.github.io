      <p>Am I the only one not shocked about the iland 2 announcement? Like when they said song Kang was going to the military I lowkey already knew it was going to hanbin</p>

      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean itâ€™s only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>

      <p>I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the same day the pre recording was today so most of it is shot in advance like bp was. Also am I the only one that thought I land was filmed in the middle of no where, apparently itâ€™s right near the cjenm building and the whole iland building is built on a cj lot.</p>

      <p>and yall shocked they picked hanbin? ðŸ˜­ like another anon previously said on here they'd rather go bankrupt than give anyone else something big before giving it to hanbin come on guys we already know the formula, what's funny tho is some non-fans watchers of the show saying he's not famous enough to take after song kang like he's not even a year into his career but damn cj is truly working overtime for his future career post disbandment</p>

      <p>Eh most non watchers didn't like Song Kang being the mc bc the dude wasn't even there since he recorded some videos before enlisting and that's it + he was serious as hell during the whole thing so it's not like he was fun or something.</p>

      <p>I heard most people were actually really happy especially after the pre recording repos came out and they found out he was actually going to be there on set and not through videos because like anon said people generally didnâ€™t like that because there was no interactions with the trainees because it was all pre recorded clips. The general consensus seems to have been quite positive tbh, and it was a smart move on cjâ€™s behalf Iâ€™ll admit because their viewership ratings for iland are horrendous but Iâ€™ve already seen loads of people say they will tune in because heâ€™s mcing so if thereâ€™s a spike in viewership next week it works out well for them.</p>
