      <p>You people think "ms song" is the zb1 head manager you guys think she arranged the Gucci deal and you think her solo position of casting and management (mind u shes not even an exec) IS PULLING THESE STRINGSðŸ˜­ if hanbin becomes the mc of swf2 for whatever reason lets not act like the gig doesn't make sense that's his literal niche he's associated w the company that owns some of the rights, was in the dance field, and is an mc backed by cj like???? Don't tell me what I don't know why do u guys get shocked at the obvious. I just wish the group could get stuff as good as thw solo stuff hanbin gets like it's highly irking but it's not like any of this surprises me and it's not from some lady

      <p>I don't think a single lady is giving him jobs, no, but obviously he is backed by higher ups from his previous and current management Hanbin isn't nearly popular enough to get the gigs he get (and TBF neither were zb1 as a whole for the gigs they got during in bloom era, Hanbin was just pushed more) it's fine it means he was smart and made good connections during his trainee and dancer days</p>
