      <p>but it's suss af

1. reactivating at the dead of night
2. right after their performance
3. if everyone making ig then why didnt hanbin reactivate his

something must've happened because my local transit company the TTC was going to go on strike yesterday aka Friday which would completely shut down toronto since were so heavily dependent on public transport and unlike you american's we actually have a functional transit system that ppl use. anyways. they reached a deal at 4AM and every got to work. so something def happened. ot8 coming</p>
