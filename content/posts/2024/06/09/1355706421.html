      <p>i mean I kinda expected this, they treat their mcs like royalty. Miyeon was called to any gig that mcountdown/mnet could get her into and they even did that cover of into the new world on where they invited just lead vocals and sub- vocals so Miyeon could get that Taeyeon high note ğŸ˜­</p>
