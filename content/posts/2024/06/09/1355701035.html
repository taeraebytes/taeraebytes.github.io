      <p>Yujin posting a video with everyone but Gyuvin; frankly, Gyuvin is always warm and happy, which makes everyone's member mood light up, so as OT9 I think Yujin being brat and ungrateful pises me off, like, Why are we always rude and ungrateful to the person who loves you the most? Yujin is taking Gyuvin for granted.</p>
