      <p>it's so funny how mcd loves him downnnnkdsnfksdnf like with music show mcs there's like an Even vibe if that makes sense but with mcd it's the hanbin show ft his sidekicks jaehyun and sohee (mostly thinking about the music show room guests like nowadays being on when they're nugu and no one cares about them other than how hanbin used to train with them, hui was prob hanbin influence, a lot of nct which is sohee too bc company mates but like. hanbin LMAO also gyuvin visited mcd yesterday to see ateez do we think hanbin put a word in to get them on so gyuvin could meet them again) and i mean i'm not opposed to it bc love hanbin dgaf about jaehyun and sohee but it's funny to look at like damn</p>

      <p>idk where i saw this, probably a briize on twt or cc, or if it has any substance (probably not, bet it was a theory with no actual proof and seunghan stans tweaking from the hiatus) but i saw someone speculate that seunghan was gonna have the mc gig but bc of his scandal it was given to sohee - theyâ€™re both less popular members so it would give either one a boost but if they did choose seunghan before it was probably bc he seems more extroverted and more of a visual.</p>

      <p>lmfao ur anon just made that up ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ seunghan was never gonna get no mc job are u crazy? he got exposed the second he debuted it was never gonna be him and plus mnet clearly wanted hanbin to be the star so jaehyun is shorter than him and then sohee is shorter and uglier than him so it works out ugh plus eunseok sucks at mcing im sorry he is so awkward to me and then shotaro is a japanese he can barely speak korean, sungchan does hajj to inkigayo so he wont betray and then we have wonbin and anton left who are both useless. sohee was our last and only choice</p>
