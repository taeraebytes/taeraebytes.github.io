      <p>I know discussions here are about to get annoying so let's start talking about something else 

Let's talk about how gunwook is like one of the only few ACTUAL all rounders in kpop because half the people that people call all rounders in kpop are mostly all just good dancers and if we're lucky MAYBE a slightly decent vocalist none of them ever write their own raps or anything so the question of being a good rapper already gets dismissed the only person who I can think of that it really applies to rn other than him is woodz and even then gunwook is a better vocalist than him (but he does excel in other arenas more than him) if there's anyone else ppl here can point out i would loveee to talk about it</p>

      <p>The way I literally specified writing raps as criteria for being a rapper anon can you not read? üòë Gunwook has literally rapped self written raps several times and if he was given the opportunity he would do it more</p>

      <p>Gunwook is very talented and I like his flow but his lyricism is kinda weak for now his best self written work is still the one he did when he was like 16 on that one show, maybe we just didn't get to hear a lot though</p>

      <p>i like his lyrics a lot the English ones don't matter but the Korean ones when they're broken down to me are good imo but I agree his best was the early stuff we saw but I said before his creativity is definitely being stunted in zb1 I hope whatever lies in the future for him let's him see his fullest potential

      <p>No I think so too but wild idol is definitely my favorite and that's really just a result of him being pushed and being allowed to be creative and getting feedback from big rappers but that doesn't mean everything else after isn't great lyricism I just want him to keep growing
