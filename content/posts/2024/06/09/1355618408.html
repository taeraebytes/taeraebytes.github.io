      <p>I didn't expect it just cuz he's already a weekly mc so why add another consistent schedule

      <p>I mean it’s only for part 2 which ends in a couple weeks anyway, tbh it made the most sense because they already work with him and know him so rather than go searching round for a new mc why not just stick him in there</p>

      <p>diff anon but ngl that's what weirded me out normally i wouldn't care bc im used to hanbin being the 1 benefitter from cj connections but like he already has a fixed schedule on the SAME day? like omg are other members who expresed wanting to be mcs that unworthy of their payola they'd make him have two mc-ing gigs in the same day but wtv it's a bit a funny allins were tweaking about how wk1 is exhausting him (by doing his job as a leader) and that's why he says he's tired but they're enjoying whatever new solo gig he has because it benefits him only and not the whole group</p>

      <p>Maybe I’m just remembering wrong but as a whole I never remembered any of the past produce groups I stanned having as many solo or unit jobs as zb1 do. Even the po1, like it was majority whole group schedules and I’d say the solo stuff took offf after disbandment like I was a wizone and I’d actually disagree if you said wonyoung was getting premium treatment in terms of jobs because for things like variety ect it was mainly yena and yujin and aside from that they didn’t do much that current zb1 members do. Even photoshoots like group ones were way more common that solo or units.</p>

      <p>They really started so wrong bc they gave out solo jobs during debut to a member so they have no choice now but to just continuously give it to everyone. the effects of august to september will never leave us i fear and also the reason why the p01 was so prominent during produce groups was because they had so much group gigs so center get highlighted the most while for zb1 you only get to see them mostly as a unit or solo</p>
