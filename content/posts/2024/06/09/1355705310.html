      <p>JDNFJNCMNDMDMD redstart has always been sooo good with their management and promo idk how junhyeons getting this stuff but I realized sooo early on they're doing the right moves for this group if people actually gave a fuck about the other three members and if they were cute they'd probably be doing really well. But I saw their new member and he's a rlly good singer and he's pretty why didn't he get put on bp cuz the other members are a chopðŸ˜­
