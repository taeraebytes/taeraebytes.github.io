      <p>it’s just funny to me how gunwook catches slack for trying to actively work on his craft and something that interests him even while the company won’t let him do anything officially whether that be a cover on youtube or in the songs even though he’s good😭 anyway he’s still only 19, he’s the one member actively trying all that for himself and i admire he wants to do because writing lyrics is hard, especially with their schedules. he doesn’t have to do any of it but he does 🤷‍♀️ he’s still learning how and what to do for stuff too and i agree his growth has been stunted in zb1 and it pisses me off but wow anons piss me off so bad in here too HOW DO U DO ITJFJDBKS</p>

      <p>agree agree agree I was surprised he's still so eager to rap and express himself and work on his craft usually people give that up for a few years or push it to the back burner he's impressive asfkkkk but idk how I do it either I've just learned not to take anonymous ppl seriously and I've been on cc long enough that almost nothing phases me LOLLLL but let's pray he can reach his potential I feel like he's been interested in self producing as well since he was talking ab the specific beats he wants to rap over ugh WOW WE NEED HIM THE STU IMMEDIATELY
