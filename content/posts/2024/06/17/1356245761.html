      <p>For 7/10 I rlly rlly hope so and I think they will honestly if we got smth as good as we did for 420 we can get smth for 710 but I'm positive it won't be an unscripted live..ðŸ’” but I hope it's something fun or emotional manipulation we need some more

      <p>no it was just gossip LMAO cause they never dress cohesively like that when they dont have a schedule or performance and they usually wear their own clothes so ppl were just wondering why and someone mentioned probably filming stuff maybe zbtv or anniversary stuff cause it is coming up</p>
