      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there ðŸ˜­ if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>
