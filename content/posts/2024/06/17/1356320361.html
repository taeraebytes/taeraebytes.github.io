<a href="https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/lupita-is-not-being-pushed-anymore.4582957/">https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/lupita-is-not-being-pushed-anymore.4582957/</a> she wanted to lay low after the Weinstein scandal but now the black girl from the bear (ayo edebiri) has taken her spot..sad because atleast lupitia actually hanged out with ppl of her skin color unlike ayo</p>

      <p>Oh ayo wishes she could be lupita ugh sorry I will never like herrrrr AND SHE WAS SHIT IN THE BOTTOMS TWITTER WAS LYING SOOOO HARD but like idk ayo is an unserious actor with like one good character (I'm assuming her character in the bear was good) she's not touching lupita ever imo even twitters not gonna has her that high but there's still the quiet place franchise at the end of this month and she's the main character I have faith in her get back
