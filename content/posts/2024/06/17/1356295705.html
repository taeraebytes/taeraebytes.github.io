      <p>the degree of parasocial attachment of some kpop fans is scary ngl 😭 just stumbled upon a twt page of girl who join every single fancall with hanbin and is fully convinced he’s in love with her and thinks about her and idk looking through her tweets made me terrified, like i get a healthy dose of parabsocialism if it makes you happy but sometimes it’s just too much 😭 honestly shit like this makes me feel some resentment towards idols even if it’s my bias and keeps me in check lol</p>
