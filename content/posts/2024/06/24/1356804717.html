      <p>he‚Äôs the most popular member by far it‚Äôs always the popular members who have the most akgaes bc their fans think the group is holding them back and then they start schizoing out</p>

      <p>ok this is funny bc i feel like in svt it's not like this at all like they hardly have akgaes but if i were to judge from the little i've seen i'd say top 3 most akgaes is dk, jun and joshua which makes no sense with the popularity thing bc most popular members are wonwoo, mingyu, jeonghan and hoshi (probably). but dk is akgae'd bc his stans think carats see him as a joke and i guess there's main vocal rivalry with seungkwan, jun bc sinophobia (true) and 'mistreatment' even tho he has a fuck ton of solo schedules and then joshua bc......... idk. he's boring as shit. like with svt u would think that mingyu would have the most akgaes like that's just what makes sense TO ME</p>
