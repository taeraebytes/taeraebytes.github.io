      <p>i was seeing the hanbin jungkook discourse and really want to say one thing, they are not comparable just because their singing technique is similar, jk has trained longer and debuted at an age when hanbin has not even started training, some things are just easier when you started learning them earlier whether it is singing, dancing or learning a language so we can not really compare them, so comparing hanbin with most of the other idols who have started earlier and trained longer is kind of icky</p>

      <p>In what way?????? Judging them off of technique is an actual comparable way that can be measured no matter the amount of time one has trained or started singing if anything what you just said makes jungkook worse the fuckðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it's crazy like did u not read a single thing said

      <p>I have read all the discussion and this is my own opinion, in the case of learning the earlier you start the more good you will be at it, don't know where but i have read a discussion about learning (don't remember if it is german or chinese), both language have lots of tones, the meaning changes according to the tones, so it is easier if you started early because your mind can recognise the tones clearly when you are younger which imo is similar to singing, for dancing when you are younger where body is more flexible so injure less and know how to move the proper way; it's not like you are going to be good if you are older like look at hao's dancing, he started late but you have to have a natural talent for it
this is why i said you can not really compare hanbin with most of the idols, he himself said he started learning how to sing when he was 19-20 which is really, really late, the only advantage he has is high musicality bacause of his dancing and even if he knows the right tune he needs to train longer to sing the right way, it's not like i can sing a high note randomly i need to know the right technique and right way to move my throat also training my throat so that it move the right way every time which would be so much easier if i am younger and trained longer</p>

      <p>but if hanbin and jungkook are both on a similar level technique wise even tho jungkook has a decade on him and hanbin started late with minimal training that just means 1 hanbin has more potential than jungkook and 2 they are quite literally at the same level vocally like yes jungkook is a better performer with better stability but we only talked ab their vocal abilities literallt everything ur listing is skills that have to do with technique which btw... they're in the same level at what's ur point in genuinely confused
