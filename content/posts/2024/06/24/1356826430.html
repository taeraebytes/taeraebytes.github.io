      <p>Man cnetz are being so disgusting to Wonyoung its crazy, i was just on xhs and her vid came up and the comments are just vile. Im not chinese or korean so i cant say i care to remember or understand the culutral specifics. But why are fhey only taking the blame out on her? And why do they still support the korean industry and other kpop idolsthen, when they know they can do the exact same thing?ðŸ˜­</p>
