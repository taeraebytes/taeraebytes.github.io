      <p>For me I AM is their best song. As soon as I heard it, I thought this is gonna be the song that stands the test of time. Its such an amazing song that doesnt rely on concept like Love Dive or being over the top like After Like. The primary colours of that era were literally Black and White, there was nothing special about anything but the song and its lyrics, thats so hard for a kpop song to do. Its gonna be so hard for them to top that.</p>
