      <p>okay as an ex exol.... uhhh

xiumin as matthew i can see but xiumin is waaaay more introverted, but the cutie agenda they have going fits 
gunwook and kai i can actually see? they're both really cute off stage 
hanbin suho.. are you crazy im sorry fawk suho dont say that ever again hanbin is leagues above him in every aspect fuck suho 
hao baekhyun yeah i could see that ? the whole sassy and all rounder thing but bbh is waaay more extroverted 
taerae chen/do hmmm i could see do way more but without the playful vibes, he only matches chen if we're talking rookie era tbh, tr is more like bbh personality wise 
ricky chanyeol.. oh you're tweaking pcy is too annoying lol, i could see sehun more for him 
yj fits do more tbh</p>
