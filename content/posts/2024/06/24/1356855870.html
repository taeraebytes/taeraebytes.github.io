      <p>Man cnetz are being so disgusting to Wonyoung its crazy, i was just on xhs and her vid came up and the comments are just vile. Im not chinese or korean so i cant say i care to remember or understand the culutral specifics. But why are fhey only taking the blame out on her? And why do they still support the korean industry and other kpop idolsthen, when they know they can do the exact same thing?ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>honestly its a combination of patriotism and rumors of wy being taiwanese which isnt going to go down well for any k-celeb. add the fact that wonyoung is a huge target and rivals a lot of popular fandoms, then u get why her hate is so large. it is interesting how she has recovered her image so well in korea and intl compared to like 2 years ago, but in china its not great, but she doesnt promote there or speak that language so sheâ€™s fine.</p>

      <p>guanlin was dragged by cnetz when he got caught spitting on the sidewalk after smoking and then an ex-fansite of his exposed his gf. his image took a hit and he never really blew up after that. heâ€™s retired from the industry now he said he wants to focus on behind the scenes work and being a director</p>
