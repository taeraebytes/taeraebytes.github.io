      <p>anon who just sent that svt akgae ask i was reading through all the discussions and it made me want to do zb1 as svt but i cannot for the life of me think of who would be who. ppl have compared hanbin to joshua which pisses me off bc joshua is boring as i said before and i know ppl find hanbin boring but IDK IT DOESN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME. ppl compare hao to jeonghan which i kinda see... i think he's a mix between jeonghan and seungkwan (jeonghan personality wise, seungkwan bc main vocal and they both are obsessed with kpop like i want them to be friends) but for everyone else i can't think of who i'd pair them up with</p>
