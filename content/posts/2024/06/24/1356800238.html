      <p>I'll never get your beef with gunrae ðŸ˜­ gw adores him and thinks tr is cute and tr always hypes gw and has been getting closer with him by gaming and hanging out with him let the beef go ðŸ˜­ just because kfans ship them doesn't mean they aren't cute as a duo (not as a ship)</p>

      <p>because they honestly don't interact much and barely lean into the yaoi fanservice (esp. tr doesn't want anything to do with this at all ðŸ˜­) but their rps archive has over 3k followers and whenever they do anything that isn't just standing next to each other their tweets pull 500 likes in average they're definitely one of the mid tier ships size wise and growing</p>

      <p>That's one  of the big reasons guntael is so big, cause taerae is clingy with other young guys like gyuvin but doesn't do that to gunwook. It's one of the main plots of their fics where gunwook is jealous about that</p>

      <p>Just think of it easily every bg is going to have a ship of a short (arguably) pretty bottom who is usually older and the taller muscly strong but affectionate top who is usually younger. Add in factors like gwk being a muscle pig to kfans, taerae fitting the bl webtoon standards of pale-ish skin short and big butt, then that Matthew isn't popular with the rps fandom at all, then you get why guntael is big.</p>

      <p>you know what i dont like about this dynamic? they depict gunwook as some kind of desperate dude tailing after taerae, begging for his attention ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like fuck you omgâ€¦ 
some mattwookers (esp the matt harem crowd side eyeing yall) can be like that too but a whole lot of gmg monogamists have risen and rlly see their whole dynamic as two dudes who cherish and are comfy with each other ðŸ¥¹ itâ€˜s pretty fun recently in intl rps scene ðŸ¥¹</p>
