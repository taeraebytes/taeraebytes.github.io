      <p>Most like hao2binz share a floor? Since gyuvin was in both of their lives yesterday and we know hao had that bday surprise for hanbin 
Then for the rest Matthew did say something about gunwook in his live so maybe mattwookjin in one floor?</p>

      <p>The way taerae worded it it seems like Hanbin was the one that left the room so it looks like he kept the old bedroom 
For hao I'm not sure because his clothes are still in gunwooks room, gunwook did add a desk where hao bed was so it looks like haos gone and gunwook kept the room
So yeah I'm guessing gunrae are still in their old rooms, the rest are all uncertain</p>
