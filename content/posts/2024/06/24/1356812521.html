      <p>he seems like he naturally gravitates or is more comfortable around americans than chinese ppl. pls chill I'm not tryna be racist or start shit but something I noticed  since rewatching bp i noticed he chilled with american english speakers more than chinese trainees like kamden, jay, ollie and even matthew etc when hao his label mate was there and kuanjui and that zhao guy was there</p>

      <p>Maybe in the context of bp just cuz when he was actually in America he stuck with the Chinese community. I get what u mean tho he probably felt more comfortable
