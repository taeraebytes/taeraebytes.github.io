      <p>I feel like since it's hard to make group lives wakeone should do trio lives like this like we can have mattraewoong riwookjin and hao2binz mattraewoong will give us the very in your face yaoi bait, riwookjin will be a comedic trio where they roast eachother and crack a lot of jokes and hao2binz will be messy as hell cause all three have the tendency to judt say shit when they're tweaking or too lit and they'll be extra comfortable since they're together so like I see the chaos potential</p>

      <p>hanbin is definitely committing on live I'm not even gonna subject myself to the mattraewoong poopoo platter but riwookjin sounds fun I wanna watch them dance or play Minecraft

      <p>Idk cause Hanbin is super careful and anxious but he sometimes does stuff where I'm like ???the baekyeon ai stuff is the first thing that comes to mind but it's been several instances where I was like I thought you of all people thought before you speak üò≠üò≠also I feel like jjangyuz are the two people where their approval and humour is more important than his fans so he would start getting too comfortable ughhh the amount of discourse and controversy a trio live would bring now I really need it</p>

      <p>I always got why haobin are popular even I moved during the finale or for naughty etc they look good together so I wouldn't be mad if they got duo schedules
As a trio though? I don't see it either but it's funny cause I don't care about haobin as individuals while I loooive gyuvin üò≠but I feel like his relationship with them brings the worst in him like gyuvin is at his best when he's light casual genuine fun and heartwarming but with haobin it's HIGH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS TUMBLR POETRY emotions all the time and it's like damn calm downüò≠</p>

      <p>i think gyuvin acts that way with haobin because as the eldest child, he‚Äôs used to dotting on others and they are the only hyungs who really treat him like a younger brother. gyuvin‚Äôs always babying matthew, taerae and him always play around like same age friends, and jiwoong has said that he sees gyuvin as a hyung or something like that before. meanwhile, hao is always giving gyuvin piggyback rides and gives him a lot of attention. hanbin also gives gyuvin a ton of attention and is like thee big brother figure for him. but that‚Äôs just how i see it.</p>

      <p>As an eldest child myself with older friends that's true but gyuvins always been pretty close to both of them this annoyance is about the recent uptick and exaggeration with the trio like he knew how to act before but it's just so obviously an image thing rn which you know go ahead part of ur job but it's annoying to see cuz he's so blatant well I'm not annoyed it's just crazy

      <p>req is right we know the three of them are close but gyuvin recently just been doing too much and it‚Äôs so obvious it looks so damn weird and insincere to me üò≠ he mentions them for no reason all the time too and it never used to be so regular actually like it happens every day even multiple times like let it go.. and as another anon mentioned he‚Äôs gonna get jumped by their fans at some point and move onto another person after getting depressed on plus chat or smth</p>
