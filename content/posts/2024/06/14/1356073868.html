      <p>And Hanbin is out there being giddy over Gunwook visiting his birthday ads and calling the maknaes cute in his bubble. You annoying me will not make me hate Gunwook. But you are just so hateful when it comes to Hanbin. It baffles me knowing how much Hanbin adores Gunwook with Gunwook also writing about having deep conversations with Hanbin at nights. Do you have nothing positive to talk????</p>
