      <p>I know alot of people are gonna hate this but if ZB1 were to ever renew their contracts I need Jiwoong not to renew his and Iâ€™m gonna need Yujin to be the new Center. Almost all of our problems would fade away. Yujin is young, handsome and full of potential. He is also korean which the korean general public is going to like more. Hao not being a Center any longer will also drive his craziest fans away. Allins and Rosins in general will calm down too cause they will not be on the P01 mindset anylonger</p>
