      <p>no, they love cute people. i've been more 10 years on j-idol. talent don't matter too much. that's why ricky gain interest lately because on j-varshow they show how cute he is. my last idol from china also more popular in japan because he is cute.</p>

      <p>lol there are j-idols stan who like k-idols with the same reasons too. it's not about industry, it's about their personality. the foreign group member that usually popular in japan has these character :
1. they can speak japanese well (hardworking mindset)
2. they are hilarious/funny/cute
overall jfans tend to like cute people. i've been staning j-idols, k-idols, and c-idols for long, so i knew their fans preferences. also jzerose have their fave j-idols wdym.</p>

      <p>yeah he is good at japanese and cute. also jfans are more fanatic and diehard, they won't change their idol easily even if their idol faced some scandals. once they become a fan, it will be a lifetime</p>
