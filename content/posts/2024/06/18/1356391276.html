      <p>Ricky is in Kpop group while the people on those hit tweets are otakus, cosplayers, anime lovers who are usually haters of Kpop. Again, Ricky has always been popular for his looks but only few would tune in to ZB1 from those people since their interests are more of fashion, makeup and other things unrelated to Kpop. If a member goes viral for singing, dancing or anything related to Kpop, people who engage on the posts would check out ZB1's music. Always remember, Cha Eunwoo is so popular for his looks but his group is still nugu. But of course, WK1 can try to push Ricky more. The only problem is that, to which audience?</p>

      <p>another anon but tbh it's not like ricky isn't marketable in Korea or Koreans don't like him cuz they do. I rmb u guys posting bout him trending on theqoo and that korean male forum multiple times for his fashion and visuals and it wasn't just 1-2k views like 'someone' else it was like 100k views everytime.

So there's definitely something bout him even that the sinophobic korean gp likes but wakeone isn't doing anything. I get not really doing anything for jpn gp but he already proved he can reach the korean gp without wakeone doing anything, like push him in a fashion route or as a visual or something they're literally wasting obvious potential. Ricky is like 4th on my list so don't start and say I'm biased but it's annoying we ignoring how he did reach k gp multiple times but u guys only talk about j gp and lowkey downplaying it.</p>

      <p>Whatre u talking ab this is a cc if no one sends anything it's not gonna get talked ab I'm not a forum bro we gossipðŸ˜­?? and no one's downplaying the j stuff it's so general and obviously from a casual standpoint with no real target audience not to mention not in their main market so how would they capitalize off it if wakeone doesn't even know how to use social media if you wanna talk ab all that then send it that's how it works

      <p>Japan is definitely amongst wakeones and literally any other kpop companies main target audience with Korea, it's a much bigger music market with more loyal fans that will spend a lot, lapone who manages zb1 in Japan are also way better and more competent imo</p>

      <p>I consider only korea their main audience they're a kpop group after all japans market is easily the the most achievable success market but that's not where their dominating fandom lies

      <p>They're the second biggest fanbase is in Japan they have a really big and steady fanbase in Japan, that was also a big reason for izone success and why hybe and now SM are trying to get into this market so bad
I do agree that lapone are way better yurayura was very good and the fancon was perfect</p>
