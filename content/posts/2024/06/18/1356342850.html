      <p>"why give him lower amount of stocks than members who are less popular than him in china (mt, hb)"

that popularity is mostly based off of weibo tho. there still can be some differences between popularity because of haobin cp. in my eyes criyangis just wanted to complain that ricky sold out 🤷🏻‍♀️ yknow complaining while showing off at the same time</p>
