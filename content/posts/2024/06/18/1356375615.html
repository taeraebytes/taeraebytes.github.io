      <p>bruh this is normal day for us that's just him tbh he kinda did the same thing to this one jfan and that one gunwooks fan he kept praising, calling her gorgeous for like 10s straight and let's not forget that one girl on twt that he always replying to on mnetplus to the point she got harassed by other fans on her cc ðŸ˜­ but at least u can tell he's really genuine and nice from their interactions</p>
