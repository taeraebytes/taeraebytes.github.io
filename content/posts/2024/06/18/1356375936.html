Again, Ricky has always been popular for his looks but only few would tune in to ZB1 from those people since their interests are more of fashion, makeup and other things unrelated to Kpop. If a member goes viral for singing, dancing or anything related to Kpop, people who engage on the posts would check out ZB1's music. Always remember, Cha Eunwoo is so popular for his looks but his group is still nugu. But of course, WK1 can try to push Ricky more. The only problem is that, to which audience?",
