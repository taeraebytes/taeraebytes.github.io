    "question": "I believe that MCing with a female MC of the same age from a popular gg is a high danger; I recall Yujin accidently touching Leeseo in the second episode while showing his dance moves, and a few he/him dives threatening to kill him, so it's no surprise that he appears terrified when doing MC work. He is kind of getting sunghoon treatment during MC with Wonyoung only thing leeseo is not at Wonyoung level so nobody escalate that much.",
