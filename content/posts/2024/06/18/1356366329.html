      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there ðŸ˜­ if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>

      <p>Using an akgae acc to prove your point is wild (and the emoji nbhungry posted was absolutely not related to yujin but she was just impatient with the haobin selca he promised). Itâ€™s still up on her acc. Those akgaes should buy Picart or Canva pro</p>
