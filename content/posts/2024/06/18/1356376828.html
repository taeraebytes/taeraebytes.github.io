      <p>Fully diamond embedded, Girl can we do this for gunwook as well,  frankly speaking it's weird that only member is getting gift how bad other would feel like  ðŸ˜ž 
Let me know your thoughts we will do fundraising for gunwook as well.

      <p>Those diamonds won't make Yujin a better singer than Gunwook though. Zhang Hao refused diamonds on his mic and said that it was too much.  Let those bunnies get crazy. Yujin's Cfans are in competition with Hao's Cfans. The piano gift gagged me. I would understand the violin cos it's smol and won't take up so much space, but the piano. ðŸ˜‚ Yeah, let them show off</p>
