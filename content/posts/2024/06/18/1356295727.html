      <p>the degree of parasocial attachment of some kpop fans is scary ngl ðŸ˜­ just stumbled upon a twt page of girl who join every single fancall with hanbin and is fully convinced heâ€™s in love with her and thinks about her and idk looking through her tweets made me terrified, like i get a healthy dose of parabsocialism if it makes you happy but sometimes itâ€™s just too much ðŸ˜­ honestly shit like this makes me feel some resentment towards idols even if itâ€™s my bias and keeps me in check lol</p>

(that's like a 20 sec clip from the whole call) like that's their job and ur convo doesn't a higher value btw

      <p>You can be parasocial in different ways you can be a mom fan, a manager fan, a friend fan, this girl is objectively parasocial and her behaviour isn't normal y'all are wild if you think otherwise</p>
