      <p>usually management and all that other staff that works in a company that arent the idols.. it basically seems like a media studies/communications degree</p>

      <p>is it? cuz i remember hanbin told he learnt how to detect the camera change while on stage from his major idt the kpop major is basically media studies/comms and he always had to practice performances for his projects thats how he had a lot of videos uploaded on youtube from his uni days. i really think kpop major is almost like trainees in a company but i could be wrong</p>

      <p>I rlly don't know it's an odd major because it seems like it would only benefit trainees but like I'm sure half of the students aren't

Dong-A Broadcasting Arts University established a new K-pop major in 2013. It is to raise field-type professional talents related to Hallyu. When you enter the K-pop department, you learn the basics of dance and singing skills and music-related basics in the first year, and in the second year, you learn lyrics, composition, and arrangement for creation. We conduct convergence classes in cooperation with other departments, in order to improve your understanding of not only your major but also in the field of broadcasting arts. In the 3rd grade, they release their own music and even conduct a showcase based on the creative choreography. It is to educate you to graduate after debuting as a full-fledged musician. As it is a junior college that raises experts, the theory and practical skills are in a good way.

Graduates can produce their own music as digital records. If you make a record, we will support the Korean Music Copyright Association and the Korean Music Performance Association. After graduation, most students advance into various fields of broadcasting arts, such as idol singers, singer-songwriters, choreographers, dancers, vocal coaches, dance coaches, producers, composers, YouTubers, and models.</p>

      <p>Hmmmm this seems less like media communication then it sounds kind of like a formal education for artists but using kpop as a reference?
