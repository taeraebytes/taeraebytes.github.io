      <p>The timing is wrong too. Hanbin started MCing whike ZB1 was in hiatus. He has time to practice a lot before each episode, though he's originally good. For Yujin, he started when they're promoting. Packed schedule and definitely not enough time to practice MCing when he originally has no talent for it. This is another WK1 mismanagement. Unlike MCountdown, Inkigayo is being broadcasted in free tv. GP would know him as a lame MC.ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>rosins are more dramatic and annoying and think everyone who isn't one of them hates hao and only them have the right to talk about him and he needs to have everything meanwhile allins are god sent demons who think anyone who isn't hanbin should die and isn't worthy of anything and all the other members are fake friends who are secretly plotting against hanbin and leeching off of his fame and have zero fans in korea small description of my experience on zerose twt ever since Sept 2023</p>
