      <p>Ricky is in Kpop group while the people on those hit tweets are otakus, cosplayers, anime lovers who are usually haters of Kpop. Again, Ricky has always been popular for his looks but only few would tune in to ZB1 from those people since their interests are more of fashion, makeup and other things unrelated to Kpop. If a member goes viral for singing, dancing or anything related to Kpop, people who engage on the posts would check out ZB1's music. Always remember, Cha Eunwoo is so popular for his looks but his group is still nugu. But of course, WK1 can try to push Ricky more. The only problem is that, to which audience?</p>

      <p>I feel like forcing Ricky to do the riize type of tiktok contents would be good for example, I would also open a zb1 Pinterest maybe make him do trendy gaming streams, not using that hype at all is dumb you could tap into a new market there's only a thin line separating vtuber fans and kpop fans for ex</p>
