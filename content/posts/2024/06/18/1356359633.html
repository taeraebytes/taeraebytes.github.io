      <p>Oh ayo wishes she could be lupita ugh sorry I will never like herrrrr AND SHE WAS SHIT IN THE BOTTOMS TWITTER WAS LYING SOOOO HARD but like idk ayo is an unserious actor with like one good character (I'm assuming her character in the bear was good) she's not touching lupita ever imo even twitters not gonna has her that high but there's still the quiet place franchise at the end of this month and she's the main character I have faith in her get back

      <p>Right I just don't think anyone takes ayo serious but zendaya is so mid at acting but she hasn't done projects as big as lupita either cuz she's not taken seriously

      <p>i feel like dune is a big project since people are calling it the next star wars level franchise, with that and challengers she'll be in the running for even more big projects</p>

      <p>Get out= worldwide gross of $255.5 million
Black panther= worldwide total of over $142.2 million

Dune 2= crosses $700 million worldwide
The only thing comparable is black panther 1 w 1.3 billions worldwide but that was at the height of the marvel era</p>
