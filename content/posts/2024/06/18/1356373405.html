      <p>Fully diamond embedded, Girl can we do this for gunwook as well,  frankly speaking it's weird that only member is getting gift how bad other would feel like  😞 
Let me know your thoughts we will do fundraising for gunwook as well.

      <p>No he just chose the color there were 11 designs that the fans voted on ik cuz I did the poll and everything the design he got rn is fire tho but fully Diamond encrusted is just dumb to me like it serves no purpose it's probably heavy and limits design but yea poor yujinie he wanted black
