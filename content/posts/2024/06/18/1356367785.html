      <p>It's looks more like hate rage post from k allidans to me because he was trending few day back for visual with 25K+ views and hence they are pointing out about his skills which obviously not his strong area. They are also upset why their is no female mc with hanbin</p>

      <p>Is rps as serious as this in other fandoms? Why do i feel like at least half of the fandom are shippers and they're out and loud about it? Probably the effect of "Gays Planet" label. It wasn't like this duing Wannaone. It's tiring actually. The constant fight between solos and shippers is draining...</p>
