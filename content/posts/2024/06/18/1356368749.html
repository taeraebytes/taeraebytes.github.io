      <p>The timing is wrong too. Hanbin started MCing whike ZB1 was in hiatus. He has time to practice a lot before each episode, though he's originally good. For Yujin, he started when they're promoting. Packed schedule and definitely not enough time to practice MCing when he originally has no talent for it. This is another WK1 mismanagement. Unlike MCountdown, Inkigayo is being broadcasted in free tv. GP would know him as a lame MC.ðŸ˜­</p>
