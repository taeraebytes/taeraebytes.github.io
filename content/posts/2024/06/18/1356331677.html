    "reply": "Ouuu I can agree with that they're constantly promoting and collabing w other brands their identity gets kinda lost along the way. And I feel like we lightly discussed how they whenever they comeback they're just coming back for an ad like it's so weird but I feel like especially recently they've lost the charm I liked ab them they felt so much more unique in 2022"

      <p>Am I the only one that thinks new jeans making their whole brand identity collabs looks extremely tacky? Like the powerpuff girl stuff and the takashi murakami collab</p>

      <p>I haven't thought anything of it but I was like ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” at the constant brand collabing like it's a weak attempt at showing their popularity
