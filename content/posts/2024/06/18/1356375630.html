      <p>brah when I tell you I haven't seen a group of fans that token stans and glazes someone new every week in a whileeeeee I just saw allins starting to token stan ricky after the sudden increase in binrik influx and then they stopped mentioned ricky when they saw he was trending a lot in those k-forums they love so much and just a few days ago were dragging him because they had a fight with riyangis over the birthday posts and said only 2binz is the acceptable hanbin duo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ well no shit that's cause gyuvin is a spineless loser who worships your fav and his stans aren't that many or gaf to tell y'all to stop token stanning him besides he doesn't threaten hanbin in any way ðŸ˜­ just an embarrassing bunch</p>
