      <p>Ricky is in Kpop group while the people on those hit tweets are otakus, cosplayers, anime lovers who are usually haters of Kpop. Again, Ricky has always been popular for his looks but only few would tune in to ZB1 from those people since their interests are more of fashion, makeup and other things unrelated to Kpop. If a member goes viral for singing, dancing or anything related to Kpop, people who engage on the posts would check out ZB1's music. Always remember, Cha Eunwoo is so popular for his looks but his group is still nugu. But of course, WK1 can try to push Ricky more. The only problem is that, to which audience?</p>

      <p>another anon but tbh it's not like ricky isn't marketable in Korea or Koreans don't like him cuz they do. I rmb u guys posting bout him trending on theqoo and that korean male forum multiple times for his fashion and visuals and it wasn't just 1-2k views like 'someone' else it was like 100k views everytime.

So there's definitely something bout him even that the sinophobic korean gp likes but wakeone isn't doing anything. I get not really doing anything for jpn gp but he already proved he can reach the korean gp without wakeone doing anything, like push him in a fashion route or as a visual or something they're literally wasting obvious potential. Ricky is like 4th on my list so don't start and say I'm biased but it's annoying we ignoring how he did reach k gp multiple times but u guys only talk about j gp and lowkey downplaying it.</p>

      <p>Whatre u talking ab this is a cc if no one sends anything it's not gonna get talked ab I'm not a forum bro we gossipðŸ˜­?? and no one's downplaying the j stuff it's so general and obviously from a casual standpoint with no real target audience not to mention not in their main market so how would they capitalize off it if wakeone doesn't even know how to use social media if you wanna talk ab all that then send it that's how it works

      <p>diff diff anon tbf i agree with anon BUTTT we were talking about his japanese engagement so well see what wakeone does for japan comeback ig BUT ngl wakeone be dumb af to ignore his anime 2d ai hype because those are the most die hard fans and japan is LITERALLY anime capital which is basically the japanese gp tbh because everyone and their motha watches anime and prob why his tweets are poppin there so if wakeone can SMARTLY incorporate his visual hype with the group and our music our japan comeback will be so successful 

and queefy theqoo stuff we been knew because we were talking about them here and if anything wakeone HAS to know bout him going viral on theqoo because they just fucking have to ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ theqoo is ur best glance at korean gp opinion like thats their number 1 forum so they just fucking have to know and we can EASILY avoid a cha eun woo 2.0 sitch DONT fucking jump me for this comparison im just using him because that other anon brought him up but if wakeone can smartly INCORPORATE his visuals with the group and music so it aint just him we'd be fucking plave because koreans also like that 2d ai stuff and are also already saying his visuals are ai so.... also im talking bout plave because in a diff cc thread you guys were talking about them and needing their audience but like we can EASILY yoink them or gain some of our own because ricky has the ai visuals so if only, if fucking onlyy wakeone knew how to incorporate the members hype WITH and INTO the group and our music we'd have it all thats all im saying also im a gpd i feel like i need to state this so my opinion is valid LMAOO ðŸ˜­ like i aint no pyscho riyangi but just my two cents</p>

      <p>No I'm aware of him trending on theqoo we talked ab it and anon said we did too so idk what they mean by we're ignoringðŸ˜‘...? Am I the news?? But also how do u incorporate his visuals into anything past business posts and centering concepts around him which lets be real wakeone is doing neither it rlly just comes down to knowing that there's potential and it'll never be tapped into wakeone just constantly disappoints and my point is we're so aware of it that's why I don't even like discussing it often cuz it leads to nowhere
