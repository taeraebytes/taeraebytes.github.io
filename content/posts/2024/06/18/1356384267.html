      <p>This may only apply to the i-side, but what I've learned from gpd twt is that a lot of teen girls/women in their early 20s feel immense shame for liking someone younger than them bc in their heads, attraction = the act of sexualizing someone, and sexualization = bad. 

Also liking a minor or minor-adjacent person = unambiguously bad, even if 1) you are also a minor, or would be in SK, 2) the person's minor status is due to an antiquated technicality in the law that grants you adult status based on the year, not the date, you were born, meaning you could be an 18- or 19-year old adult, or 3) you are now both adults. They'll couch it in little jokes but the fear of being labelled a creep now extends to people the same age as him, it's wild. I even see accs freaking out and feeling problematic abt being as little as 3 months older than gw. 

And then they project that conservative shame of theirs onto everyone else and assume anyone 2+ years older than him must be some shameless pedo freak for openly saying he's attractive and not viewing him as their little bro/son, like that's any less parasocial and weird lol. 

Mind you, I think a lot off these little bro/my son fans are lying to save face lol. Not that celebrity attraction, or even attraction in general, is inherently sexual, but I think parasociality has become such an embarrassing thing for some people to claim due to its associations with people who can't or willingly don't distinguish between fantasy and reality (e.g. delusionals, actual creeps) that calling a celebrity by a platonic or familial label makes their displays of attraction appear less ambiguous to both themselves and judgy onlookers. Imo most celebrity/fan attraction is its own category that can't be grouped under a typical relationship label bc it's purely theoretical/fantasy-based.</p>

      <p>I rmbr I saw someone make an age range for stanning gunwook which I thought was insane it was like 18-20 üò≠üò≠ but it's just a product of societal (twitter nobody cares irl) norms. But omg im three months older than gunwook and I swear I feel crazy sometimes cuz of how gpd twt acts like theyll fr kill u if ur not 17 it's crazy. The difference between gunwook and gyuvin is crazy too cuz they're only a few months apart and you'll never see massacres in gyuvins fandom I rlly don't know what it is. But I feel bad most of my gpd friends are older than me (were all priv) and ppl always try to paint them or their age mates as pedos like what???????????? Yea the type of fan relationship is theoretical which makes me feel bad for anyone only a few yrs older than him either grandma stanning or being crucified like damn these ppl are STRICT ASFK

      <p>that whole discussion around his age that week was so stupid you could tell no one really had a justification for why anyone more than 3 years older than him is a creep for stanning him besides "it's weird"

 the issue with age gap relationships isn't that there's a concrete age range that's acceptable and if you're anywhere outside of it you're a pedo freak... it's about stages of life and power imbalances but these people wouldnt know that because the only discourse they engage with about age gaps is on stan twitter! it's crazy though because i feel like no other member has barriers to entry like this it's like gpds don't want anyone else to like him</p>

      <p>No like it was insane and it annoys me so much who made u the president üò≠üò≠üò≠ AND CLOCK the dynamics of age gap relationships don't apply to the fan idol relationship there's no proximity for the power imbalance like calling young ppl pedos for no reason is just insane to me like please these are the stans that matter and financially contribute to gunwook.... don't block his blessings cuz u want a highschooler fandomüòí
