      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there 😭 if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>

      <p>I support hao here even though  im not like crazy hao stans tired of this brain rotten yaoi shipper. I'm glad hao telling them not to cross their limit, allidans specially haobinisit are so fucking delusional no freaking wonder that haobinist/allidans account posted random hate article about yujin, they are mad yujin and hao are close.
