      <p>well the magazine slotting thing doesnt make any sense for hbs case cause kenzo themselves must have picked him (they prepared a whole cake for him and put some baloons together with his name). nobody listens to kakgaes because most of the time they are trying to spread misinfo. i think that lacoste could have been the one to ask for hao, yj and tr too. i would have to see their behind the scenes footage. matthews is the one thats most likely slotted through the company cause i dont even remember what he was wearing or what the purpose of that magazine is</p>
