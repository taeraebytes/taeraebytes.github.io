      <p>it's just sohee is not really reacting to their antics and not so physically affectionate like hanbin jaehyun, they're both really sticking to each other they like to hug and stuff and sohee isnt like that so it makes it feel like they're ignoring him. sohee came around nowadays though he's starting to include himself teasing the other two. i guess the I and E matter too</p>
