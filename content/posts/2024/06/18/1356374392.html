      <p>It's looks more like hate rage post from k allidans to me because he was trending few day back for visual with 25K+ views and hence they are pointing out about his skills which obviously not his strong area. They are also upset why their is no female mc with hanbin</p>

      <p>Is rps as serious as this in other fandoms? Why do i feel like at least half of the fandom are shippers and they're out and loud about it? Probably the effect of "Gays Planet" label. It wasn't like this duing Wannaone. It's tiring actually. The constant fight between solos and shippers is draining...</p>

      <p>zeroses made it jebis entire brand for non fans and then act surprised when they get dragged for it? üòê "why aren't they known for for their talents" geez i wonder why maybe because of the constant tweets about shipping and fucking eo and sexuality discourse every 5 business days but god forbid someone stands up and says guys you're kinda dtm and they're either a gf stan or homophobic üò≠ no some of us are just normal and sane human beings there's no harm in some rps but it's been so normalized in zeroseville to the point of shippers basically asking members if they fuck and zeroses are sharing repos like "omg they're really fucking" üíÄ</p>

      <p>That's true I think with the super large rps community there's an equally large pushback which I find both sides odd in used to rps being so hush and more of a hidden community that stays out of the mainstream. But yea it's definitely the newer and younger fans the classy folk keep rps stuff on rps twitter but yea I can agree
