      <p>I'm really curious does hanbin not give any feedback to gyuvin? like he supposedly watches and monitors their stages and "individual fancams" and wakeone never misses a chance to insert that in every content and I've seen him give feedback to every member but I've never seen him with gyuvin unless they're doing some corny 2binz shit that no one cares about. I remember when he set him up BADLY with that siren dance so gyuvin took all the heat and got dragged so bad even when hanbin himself was mid doing that dance</p>
