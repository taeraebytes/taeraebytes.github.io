      <p>I'm seeing KZeroses heating up the favoritism narrative again (as if it's a new info). Said it was bad that WK1 allowed the release of Magazines of 5 members at the same time and agreed to the idea that Hanbin has 3 solo covers with all those perks and promos, Matt with solo but not much perks, then Haoraejin with not much promo & perks. Other Rookies don't do this thing because they're just building the group name. Only established groups do a simultaneous covers in different magazines. Well, it's not surprising for ZB1 because Wk1 gave up on group promo. But yes, KZeroses are hating on the blatant favoritism. Esp the fans of the other 4 members. Will they ever get their own covers btw?</p>

      <p>idk if the rest of the members would get their own just bc that would mean all of them would get solo or unit shoots and which magazine is gonna want jiwoong, whether that be solo or unit wise? him being the only one not getting a shoot would make his fans mad as hell even tho it should be obvious why it's happening and would create mess. like jiwoong's whole scandal is allegedly why they're not even doing ot9 shoots anymore and had to instead just have some members do magazine shoots. the one with hanbin is an exception bc i'm p sure that was organised before his scandal and i remember that aspect being discussed here</p>
