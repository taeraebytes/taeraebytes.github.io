      <p>Fully diamond embedded, Girl can we do this for gunwook as well,  frankly speaking it's weird that only member is getting gift how bad other would feel like  üòû 
Let me know your thoughts we will do fundraising for gunwook as well.

      <p>do yall know what diamonds cost? if this was fully diamond it would cost more than 100k dollars no one paying that
those are 100% Swarovski crystals (which don‚Äôt get me they are expensive too) so this costs max 5000 dollars</p>

      <p>But Swarovski was created in the lab to imitate the diamond so people can have fake diamond-looking crystals on their jewels üò≠</p>

      <p>exactly anon they were created so people can have access to jewels because diamonds are way out of reach 
also swarowski are neither diamonds nor ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù they are crystals</p>
