      <p>brah when I tell you I haven't seen a group of fans that token stans and glazes someone new every week in a whileeeeee I just saw allins starting to token stan ricky after the sudden increase in binrik influx and then they stopped mentioned ricky when they saw he was trending a lot in those k-forums they love so much and just a few days ago were dragging him because they had a fight with riyangis over the birthday posts and said only 2binz is the acceptable hanbin duo ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ well no shit that's cause gyuvin is a spineless loser who worships your fav and his stans aren't that many or gaf to tell y'all to stop token stanning him besides he doesn't threaten hanbin in any way ðŸ˜­ just an embarrassing bunch</p>

      <p>Diff anon but gyuvin is close to other members but the diff he doesnt suck up to them or worship them the way he does with hanbin quit being dense anon and stop acting like you people genuinely actually gaf about gyuvin ðŸ˜­ name 5 things about gyuvin that arent related to your fav every allindan dead we all know what you people really want is for every member to kneel down and declare hanbin God or else they're terrible fake two-faced people dpmo</p>

      <p>gyuvin has 2 brothers and a sister, LOVES mango to death, does not drink he hates it even cut off friendship with a high school friend for it, went cycling very often either by himself or with members, a fan of his recovered from depression thanks to him and became a psychotherapist he felt touched and has been thinking about it for a few days bc it gave him motivation to get through the day. how did i do? i'm not anon but idk why gyuvin's fans always reduce him to a token stan when some fans genuinely love him even if he ain't our bias</p>

      <p>We never said we token stan him. We are all solos, we just never felt annoyed by gyuvin and there are other members too. Also fighting with a sf doesn't mean we hate that member. There was a time when we hated gyuvinists??? or whatever they are called too. Tbh, these days most allins don't even know about what goes on in the fandom or within sf except when hb is mentioned (for eg, the allin rosin fights and the one time a riyangi spread misinfo about hb getting a bday tiktok)... Also we did say some hateful things about hao but I didn't see anyone talking bad about Ricky. He is still on our list of our fav zb1 members these days it includes gyuvin, yujin and ricky (for me gunwook and taerae too).... None of us even care about Matthew though</p>
