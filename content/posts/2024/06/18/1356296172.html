      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there ðŸ˜­ if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>

      <p>You can check haotexts and yes it was very obviously and unambiguously about his momanger fans but it will not matter, because it isn't the first time he calls them out directly and they do not care or pretend he's talking about someone else, nothing he says will ever matter from this point on because who he represents to his fans (aka a link to a community that define them and allow them to project their feelings onto ) have grown way past who he actually is and what he says or do, that is the only conclusion we can have from today not much else to discuss</p>
