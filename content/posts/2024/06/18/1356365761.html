      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there ðŸ˜­ if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>

      <p>"directed at his own fans" you people (@ anon) don't know shit about him and will take every chance to demonize his fans even when it's about him being the fed the fuck up about the hate he's been receiving for the past few days from fuckass haobin shippers from cside and kside because he's been closer to yuehuaz recently and are boasting about scolding him so he can "get back to his senses" and start interacting with hanbin more, just the other day there was a whole fight between krosins and khaobinists because a shipper told him at the fansign to interact more with hanbin/post a selca with him
please don't piss me off and act like you know a single shit about what goes on with him, you don't even know what these people who are shippers say to him every single day they even target him for calling himself center, all you care about is twisting his words so you can go "HA HES TALKING ABOUT ROSINS" you don't actually know shit about shit
why would people even complain to him about him missing his graduation when it's wakeone's fault?? everyone was complaining on twitter ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ are you fucking dumb you're just a shipper and would rather get some low quality yaoi from that vlog over him attending one of the most important events in his life pls kys

      <p>oh ok this is making more sense and we've been discussing the hate yujins been getting recently I think it's unfortunate hao wasn't able to attend like that's sad it's uni graduation but he had that fansign right so prior commitment nothing to do about that
