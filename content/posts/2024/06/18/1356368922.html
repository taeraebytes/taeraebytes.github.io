      <p>The writer is a Haobinist account ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­ in the Instiz app. I just saw another article uploaded by her; why would you post a story that sets him up for hate ðŸ˜¢? I mean, his hatred will eventually influence the group's image, and who needs an opponent when you have a fan like that?</p>

      <p>Why i also feel like its akage job ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­?  Because other two MC are equally boring and dull but they categorically pointed out yujin, comparing to those two yujin is bit more energetic ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­  it's like both are D - and yujin is D+</p>
