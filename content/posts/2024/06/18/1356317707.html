      <p>Yeah I was shocked too I've seen riyangis ask for the group to disband but I've never seen any openly antagonise the others and now there's several of them

Although I do respect them more than allins and rosins cause they actually truly hate everyone and do not obsess over other members like thank you for bringing real akgaeism back</p>
