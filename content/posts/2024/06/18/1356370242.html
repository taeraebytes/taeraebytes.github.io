      <p>"why give him lower amount of stocks than members who are less popular than him in china (mt, hb)"

that popularity is mostly based off of weibo tho. there still can be some differences between popularity because of haobin cp. in my eyes criyangis just wanted to complain that ricky sold out 🤷🏻‍♀️ yknow complaining while showing off at the same time</p>

      <p>Buying goods in China is not the same as in Korea; it's more difficult so a pop up store like this is considered fan benefit, because If you can't buy at the pop up store, prices can be skyrocket. 
If the stock are too low, fans feel their benefits are being missed, which is why they complain. 
194 is considered the solid top 3 in China, so there is no reason for those members to have lower stock than 3 or 8 and the staff are aware of this. Hanbin's good is only sold in China for Haobin fans, and it is explicitly write in their paper too</p>
