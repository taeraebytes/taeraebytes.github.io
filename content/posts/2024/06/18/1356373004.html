      <p>It's looks more like hate rage post from k allidans to me because he was trending few day back for visual with 25K+ views and hence they are pointing out about his skills which obviously not his strong area. They are also upset why their is no female mc with hanbin</p>

      <p>Is rps as serious as this in other fandoms? Why do i feel like at least half of the fandom are shippers and they're out and loud about it? Probably the effect of "Gays Planet" label. It wasn't like this duing Wannaone. It's tiring actually. The constant fight between solos and shippers is draining...</p>

      <p>zeroses made it jebis entire brand for non fans and then act surprised when they get dragged for it? 😐 "why aren't they known for for their talents" geez i wonder why maybe because of the constant tweets about shipping and fucking eo and sexuality discourse every 5 business days but god forbid someone stands up and says guys you're kinda dtm and they're either a gf stan or homophobic 😭 no some of us are just normal and sane human beings there's no harm in some rps but it's been so normalized in zeroseville to the point of shippers basically asking members if they fuck and zeroses are sharing repos like "omg they're really fucking" 💀</p>

      <p>I do feel like shipping is real big with us which is actually a good sign that the fandom is pretty strong and big see other bg fandoms but I do feel like people TRY to make viral moments post covers etc it just doesn't stick and you can't always blame the fandom we also need wakeone to invest in socmed promos fans can only do so much you can't blame them for constantly not just talking about talent no one does that</p>
