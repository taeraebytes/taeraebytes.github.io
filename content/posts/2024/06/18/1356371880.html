      <p>Sorry that I got angry in your cc req btw I hope I didn't bring you any negativity it's just so exhausting to see the rosins in your cc constantly control the narrative with their lies and schizophrenia and act like they're the victims when they're demonized for very very valid reasons, I miss when this cc was more diverse I should stop coming sorry if I got toxic lol</p>

      <p>When you're on weibo it's insane cause you can see live how they construct their lives, most of those weibo fans on twitter have been the biggest yujin haters like saying absolutely violent abhorrent shit about a teen on weibo but on twitter they suddenly pretend they like him it's disgusting, then they call mulbokdans hao antis for fucking with allins and zcs but if literally every other fanbases but yours can be friends with one another maybe there's a common dominator? Hao was actually my one pick but it got so bad ive been praying he doesn't redebut with yuriz, it feels so hopeless because the vast majority of zrse twt even ot9 ones are still rosins so they will just trust whatever they say and not dig for the truth, it makes for such an unwelcoming fandom environment it just feels depressing</p>

      <p>I don't touch weibo so I wouldn't know but Ive always heard it was nasty between those two fandoms but wow but idk there's so much context I don't have and a language barrier it becomes hard to talk ab these things especially when I always have so many different sides talking at me. But just what I've heard from others privately it sounds worse than I think sometimes idk we gotta pray for a whole lot of healing ALRIGHT SERIOUSLY NOOO MORE pleek it's hard for me tooðŸ˜–
