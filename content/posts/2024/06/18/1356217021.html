      <p>The writer is a Haobinist account ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­ in the Instiz app. I just saw another article uploaded by her; why would you post a story that sets him up for hate ðŸ˜¢? I mean, his hatred will eventually influence the group's image, and who needs an opponent when you have a fan like that?</p>
