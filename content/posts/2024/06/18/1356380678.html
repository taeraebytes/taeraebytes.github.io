      <p>Really random but there was an article about Hb on Pann that was trending with 15k views or something and I saw alot of comments mentioning Karina from Aespa and commenting things like "Karina ‚ù§Ô∏è Hanbin, beautiful couple" "isn‚Äôt that Karinas Boyfriend?" Do these people know something we don‚Äôt orrr... cause I know that sasaengs who left the fandom can become cruel like that once they realize or notice things... I‚Äôm seriously curious about this</p>
