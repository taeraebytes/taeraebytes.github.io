      <p>people are taking hao's plus chat messages to be against antis who subscribe to him just to send hate and i see it but it's probably also directed to his own momager fans who are mad af about him not attending graduation, they were probably complaining about it to him on there ðŸ˜­ if that's the case, i'm absolutely here for it. people treat him like a literal baby</p>

      <p>You can check haotexts and yes it was very obviously and unambiguously about his momanger fans but it will not matter, because it isn't the first time he calls them out directly and they do not care or pretend he's talking about someone else, nothing he says will ever matter from this point on because who he represents to his fans (aka a link to a community that define them and allow them to project their feelings onto ) have grown way past who he actually is and what he says or do, that is the only conclusion we can have from today not much else to discuss</p>

      <p>It was for Zerocolas. They're flooding Hao's pluschat with complaints about him sending photo with Yujin instead of Hanbin and then going on the Jeju vacation with Gyuvin instead of just Hanbin. CRosins aren't saying anything much about the graduation. It's the iRosins making it a big deal. But Hao sent Chinese because Zerocolas are the ones flooding his pluschat and they're even posting their celebration in Weibo after pissing off Zhang Hao.</p>

      <p>Zerocolas have always been known to be vile and nasty and take advantage of the fact only hao speaks chinese to harass him like idk why ifans and i-zeroses still interact and consume content from them they were the ones who bullied hao when he called himself center and told him to die if he's not gonna do fanservice with hanbin anymore</p>

      <p>This is rosin akgae rhetoric most of the quote unquote zerociola hate has no proof and some for ex the plus chat spam was quite literally Rodin's cosplaying as zc to make hap stop interacting w them not even kidding you could see them change their pfp and dn in real timeðŸ˜‚and this has happened SEVERAL TIMES I have screeshots also no zc had issues w hao calling himself the center if anything it was most likely because rosins were attacking and bullying hanbin and yujin whenever they're in the center rosins make those fake narrative to not take accountability and it's sick you need to stop believywhat those people say there's a 33582920 more rosins akgaes than zc it's pretty obvious who has been the head harasssers and bullies I need people to stop buying their narratives and for you to stop platforming them</p>
