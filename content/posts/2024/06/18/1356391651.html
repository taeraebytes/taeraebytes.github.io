      <p>The timing is wrong too. Hanbin started MCing whike ZB1 was in hiatus. He has time to practice a lot before each episode, though he's originally good. For Yujin, he started when they're promoting. Packed schedule and definitely not enough time to practice MCing when he originally has no talent for it. This is another WK1 mismanagement. Unlike MCountdown, Inkigayo is being broadcasted in free tv. GP would know him as a lame MC.ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>rosins are more dramatic and annoying and think everyone who isn't one of them hates hao and only them have the right to talk about him and he needs to have everything meanwhile allins are god sent demons who think anyone who isn't hanbin should die and isn't worthy of anything and all the other members are fake friends who are secretly plotting against hanbin and leeching off of his fame and have zero fans in korea small description of my experience on zerose twt ever since Sept 2023</p>

      <p>Ong rosins will try to make u sound like a terrible villain and they're oppressed and just write the sickest paragraph ever but allins are just straight up evil and straightforward WHICH I PREFER LIKE WHY DO ROSINS TEY TO EMOTIONALLY MANIPULATE AND VICTIM BLAME ðŸ˜­ like allin schizophrenia is textbook we can handle that I miss my old opps these new people try to get in my head

      <p>My deep analysis as someone who only gets off of privÃ© to argue with them when they piss me off badly is that yeah rosins are very manipulative but their logic is so flawed it's so easy to dismantle I have never lost a debate against one everr actually against any akgaes bcs they're dumb as hell lol they all have the same weak points and try to move goalposts, you have to never fall into their guilt tripping tactics it's just pathetic and overly personal for zero reasons when they do not know you or your motives and it has nothing to do about the treatment or the assumption of the feelings of an idol you also do not know, they try to gaslight the fuck of of everyone but if you're used to armys this will do nothing to you 

Allins are way easier, every debate I had with on was basically them saying well X member did that and you didn't care but sent hate to innocent baby Hanbin instead and me responding this has nothing to do with the discussion at hand and also you can scroll through my account I have never done the self victimising fetish scenario you have in your head because I'm not a loser lol they usually can at least admit that they're wrong in this given conversation unlike rosins OR stop responding when they know they lost not that they evolve tho because they'll be back on the same behaviour again 

Imo rosins are worse because they don't even believe what they say and know they're lying by the end of the discussion but do not care and will continue being vicious crybabies, allins are legitimately completely delusional and out of touch with reality and believe their bullshit</p>

      <p>I think the reason it gets difficult for me cuz as u said they do the exact same shit in in my inbox I'm just a stickler for fairness and I genuinely feel bad if I don't at least try to get out all the angles even I don't agree with them AND IK I SHOULD BE A DICTATOR I'm working on it so that's how they get in my head I genuinely start to feel guilty these people are tooooo good at what they do

Allins are just so visibly psychotic and won't beat around the bush with their intentions like rosins but yea rosins are worse cuz they know and they're closer to reality so it's just frustrating

      <p>Yeah you have to be confident in yourself and know that when they try to make personal statements about you and your intentions they've already lost and desperately trying to get through cause they literally do not know you at all and this has literally nothing to do with the conversation and they know it lol it's cool to be open with debates and discussions it's also your space and some people are very purposeful with what they're trying to say or spread you know who you are, it's not your job to be fair or guilt free they are no one to exploit that</p>
