      <p>the amount of stocks wasnâ€™t indicated in the paper the one who went to the store just talked to the staff and they said that they are not gonna restock ricky anymore after he got sold out bc he had so little stock. then op saw that paper with the popularity ranking (the red below) and riyangis got mad bc they know that ricky is popular there but why is his stocks still so low so they think heâ€™s being sabotaged by the company lol</p>

      <p>I would understand if Ricky has less stocks in Korea and Japan, but in Shanghai?!? It's supposed to be his hometown. Looks like they follow the stocks distribution everywhere. I remember your anon saying that Line would have similar stocks since it's not a comoany under CJ... Lol! Anything they sell, they would always follow the "who's the best-seller" stocks distribution to earn more while lowering the possible wastage.</p>
