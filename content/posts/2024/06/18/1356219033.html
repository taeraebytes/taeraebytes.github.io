      <p>I'm seeing KZeroses heating up the favoritism narrative again (as if it's a new info). Said it was bad that WK1 allowed the release of Magazines of 5 members at the same time and agreed to the idea that Hanbin has 3 solo covers with all those perks and promos, Matt with solo but not much perks, then Haoraejin with not much promo & perks. Other Rookies don't do this thing because they're just building the group name. Only established groups do a simultaneous covers in different magazines. Well, it's not surprising for ZB1 because Wk1 gave up on group promo. But yes, KZeroses are hating on the blatant favoritism. Esp the fans of the other 4 members. Will they ever get their own covers btw?</p>

      <p>im sorry but apparently all of their magazines are ads, isnâ€™t that a decision from the brands themselves? what does that have to do with the others</p>

      <p>mags have slots and companies usually bid for that slot just like how mags bid brands i think wakeone is trying to push the "members in magazine covers" narrative just like how they did with the back to back special mc gigs and i think kfans are mad bc they always give the better options towards their "favorites"</p>

      <p>thats why its bidding so its still up to those magazines if they will accept or not but most of the time its the company who picks and sends who will they bid in those slots. and this is cj guys mags and music shows are easy to get into ðŸ˜­</p>
