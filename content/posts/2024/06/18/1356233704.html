      <p>the amount of stocks wasn’t indicated in the paper the one who went to the store just talked to the staff and they said that they are not gonna restock ricky anymore after he got sold out bc he had so little stock. then op saw that paper with the popularity ranking (the red below) and riyangis got mad bc they know that ricky is popular there but why is his stocks still so low so they think he’s being sabotaged by the company lol</p>
