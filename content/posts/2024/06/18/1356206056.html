      <p>I'm seeing KZeroses heating up the favoritism narrative again (as if it's a new info). Said it was bad that WK1 allowed the release of Magazines of 5 members at the same time and agreed to the idea that Hanbin has 3 solo covers with all those perks and promos, Matt with solo but not much perks, then Haoraejin with not much promo & perks. Other Rookies don't do this thing because they're just building the group name. Only established groups do a simultaneous covers in different magazines. Well, it's not surprising for ZB1 because Wk1 gave up on group promo. But yes, KZeroses are hating on the blatant favoritism. Esp the fans of the other 4 members. Will they ever get their own covers btw?</p>
