      <p>Aespa have 1 great mini and that's it. They are literally known for having shitty ass besides their full album was absolute trash. IVEs full album is way better</p>

      <p>Twice bsides now are good tho, aesoas besides aren't bad their albums just have 0 cohesiveness and they usually feel rushed and don't match their identity, feels more like random playlists than actual albums, red velvet probably have the single most well thought out album in kpop imo I don't think a single group can match to them</p>

      <p>This is unfortunately all kpop acts sm do have the best actual albums in kpop and I will say wonder girls had a solid one too but even for sm they're pretty lazy since most of their bsides can be switched for every group and it wouldn't make a difference, kpop isn't an actual album or complex music industry</p>

      <p>I've never listened to tbz but NCT have some solid albums like even outside of kpop neo zone and the 2baddies one are really solid pop RnB album fantano would give both a score higher than 5 for sure (big for him)</p>
