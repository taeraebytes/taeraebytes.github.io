      <p>Gyuvin : we weren't close back then but whenever I looked at Hao hyungs I thought wow our Hao hyung is so handsome and talented, "I should work hard everyday so I can become a quarter or who he is" that's what I thought everyday back then, this is what I think whenever I look at my reflection in the mirror, this mirror was by the way bought by Hanbin hyung to encourage me to love myself</p>
