      <p>Lowkey a certain idol giving blank answers to their fans and looking disinterested and mad is worse than accidentallly getting caught swearing. Cause what jiwoong did is what a lot of idol/workers would do (not saying hes totally in the right) at the end of schedules it was just unlucky.</p>

      <p>LITERALLY IT IS NOTðŸ˜­ I mean yea jiwoong wasn't as unresponsive during the call but he said fuck when calls go in between and he let the fan hear it and that's worse imo I know we wish it didn't happen but it was pretty bad just cu it's more common for idols to be disinterested rather than hearing someone say fuck like I'm sure sungchan will get flack but he can move past it cuz sayinf fuck is like sealing a doom deal
