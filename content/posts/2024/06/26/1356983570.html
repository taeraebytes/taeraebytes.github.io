      <p>Twice bsides now are good tho, aesoas besides aren't bad their albums just have 0 cohesiveness and they usually feel rushed and don't match their identity, feels more like random playlists than actual albums, red velvet probably have the single most well thought out album in kpop imo I don't think a single group can match to them</p>

      <p>This is unfortunately all kpop acts sm do have the best actual albums in kpop and I will say wonder girls had a solid one too but even for sm they're pretty lazy since most of their bsides can be switched for every group and it wouldn't make a difference, kpop isn't an actual album or complex music industry</p>

      <p>idk i feel like most kpop albums that i've heard aren't cohesive at all which is sad bc even if the songs are really good it still doesn't feel complete in a way? like fully satisfactory? rv's new mini album feels really cohesive in sound imo tho i think rv has other cohesive works too which i'm thankful for (rbb for eg) like it all feels intentional rather than just getting random songs from random producers and throwing them together (like most of le sserafim's stuff or kinda yhmah for eg). not quite kpop in the sense that it wouldn't be considered idol work but rm right place wrong person and jhope jack in the box are really cohesive to me as well. it's not much of a thing in music in general but i wish there were kpop albums where all the songs basically transitioned into each other too like beyonce renaissance... oh well. guess i gotta dream since clearly none of this shit is happening all that much</p>

      <p>speaking of performances idols are such boring dancers most times it actually ticks me off a bit like i was looking at demos of ive and aespa dances compared to the final product with the idols and even when they were doing the same exact moves the dancers were just 10x more captivating and engaging ðŸ˜­ i know itâ€™s unfair to expect idols to dance exactly like professional dancers but they literally took all the energy and life out of the moves and a lot of the moves that people complain are awkward in those dances look so much better with the actual dancers because they actually put energy into them. itâ€™s why i donâ€™t really care for kpop performances in the first place tbh theyâ€™re not singing live and theyâ€™re putting bare minimum energy in to their dancing and no variations or flavor or personality it just gets boring really quickly for me</p>

      <p>So true, even now Ahyeon from BM is getting hate for sticking out a bit in her performances but shes one of the only idols nowadays that are really not sticking to just plain but has their own flavor. I know synchronised dance has always been the standard but Idk i need some groups to just be slacking but making it up by having stage presence at the same time. Thats the biggest failures of 4th gen imo</p>
