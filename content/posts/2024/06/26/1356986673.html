      <p>some people from onehallyu moved to hallyuplus and i think there are threads there that are like the most popular ones from onehallyu (plastic surgery as one example) but idk how active that whole website is.... i never really went on it but i know allkpop and maybe soompi had forums, not sure how active those are either or if they're even still up</p>
