      <p>Taerae is living in a closet like harry potter and rosins will still look you straight in the eye and tell you the company favours him cause he had a schedule on 110410 while Hao gets to love like a king in Jeju and in his new dorm with his loyal lapdog and his sneaky link🤦‍♀️</p>

      <p>When I see fansites pics of him sometimes I'm actually shocked like he's actually so gorg when he's not being himself but also his personality is so special so I also don't want him to shut his mouth</p>
