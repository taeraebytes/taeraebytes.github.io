      <p>I need zeroses to get away from the rhetoric that they dont want Zb1 permenant if its under Wakeone, like firstly this isnt Kepler we got a tour on the way bitch. Plus every company is evil including the ones yâ€™all biases got on the way; sorry that Jiwoong fucked up his career but what that got to do with anyone else. Sorry but my bias isnt surviving outside of Zb1 so i cant deal with thiss</p>
