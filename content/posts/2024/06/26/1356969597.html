      <p>i need them to fully explain the changes they made for the living situation ðŸ˜­ if they stayed in the old dorm so far it sounds like yujin moved to the upper floor and maybe taerae moved to where a manager used to have a room on that floor or like a storage room idk, matt and ricky stayed at the bottom floor and hao2binz moved into a new appartment? i need a room toor omg can jiwoong fake living in the living room or something so that we can get some proper dorm content</p>

      <p>intl fnadom is straight up stupid cause how has it never raise a hair of suspicion to them that jiwoong is never heard or seen in any of the members lives at the dorms when everyone else has. Like he's not even in any dorm anecdotes, hanbin and ricky live on different floors but hanbin would tell us ricky sings loud af at 2am and he had to tell him to shut up on kkt so they cant even use the 'oh well it's because theyre on different floors' excuse.</p>
