      <p>I was saying that Hao very visibly was very distant to the rest of yuehuaz for a while and wasn't actually friends with any of them and I suspected they didn't spend any time training together and people would jump me every time for lessening his bonds now he finally confirmed that he DIDN'T train w them! I kneeew it they were all homies expect him can't believe people were booing me  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
NOW he is actually friends w gyuvin and a lot of y'all will hate to hear this but he's only close friends w 2binz he's a bit distant with everyone else</p>
