      <p>as someone who actually watches zb1 content AND a rosin anon is.... WRONG ðŸ˜­ 

Yujin chooses ricky whenever he gets, chose ricky to write a msg to for that 1st look shoot way back I think pre debut zb1, chose ricky for who he wants as a Lil bro on eunchae diary and chose to write to ricky for that Christmas zbtv when he coulda wrote to the whole group like most members. Those I vividly remember but I can't rmb yujin choosing hao for anything on a show ðŸ’€I don't count any fansign stuff causecthey usually rmb the fans and who they bias so they all be just saying anything. That's why I only mention shows wakeone ain't part of or zbtv cause it means they gen wanted to mention/ choose the member.

 also no shit yujin likes hao but he probably sees hao as more of a guardian figure where ricky he sees as a friend and voiced out wanting to be closer to. I'm sorry anon but I'm gonna be that rosin who breaks the stereotype that we'd make up shit just to make hao seem like some kinda God the members bow down to ðŸ˜­</p>
