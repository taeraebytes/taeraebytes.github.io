      <p>intl fnadom is straight up stupid cause how has it never raise a hair of suspicion to them that jiwoong is never heard or seen in any of the members lives at the dorms when everyone else has. Like he's not even in any dorm anecdotes, hanbin and ricky live on different floors but hanbin would tell us ricky sings loud af at 2am and he had to tell him to shut up on kkt so they cant even use the 'oh well it's because theyre on different floors' excuse.</p>
