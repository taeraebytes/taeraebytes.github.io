      <p>Lesserafim were never beating aespa nj ive idle so theyâ€™ll be staying in their postiion, tbh id be suprised if anything does change i think theyâ€™ll still be listened to. people online are not doing the same shit offline they got good response at recent offline event at weverse. and im sure they got something pityworthy up their sleeve</p>
