      <p>he said he gave up on for yujin it willingly ðŸ˜­ but thank god itâ€™s him and not haobin because we would never hear the end of this, or if it was ricky riyangis would say wk1 purposefully gave everyone a room so they could degrade ricky by putting him in the closet</p>

      <p>yeah it sucks but i agree itâ€™s good that itâ€™s him since imo kkultaraes are like the least likely to tweak out over smth like that all iâ€™ve seen on my tl are ppl joking abt it calling his room shitty, comparing it to harry potterâ€™s room, and saying even cinderella had it better than him ðŸ˜­</p>
