      <p>So I am guessing that Hanbin and Hao left, Gunwook kept his room while Taerae changed rooms and Yujin got the one on where cheonamz were staying at. Then on the lower floor Matthew and Ricky are there, let's pretend that Jiwoong lives there too although we know it's fake as hell and I am guessing that Gyuvin moved to a new dorm with Hanbin and Zhang Hao.</p>

      <p>someone should use those post it notes thing and list out all the members and ask every member at a fansign (pretty sure for in person fansigns it goes down the line and u get to talk to all the member right?) to checkmark the member theyre flatmates with. I really wanna see if anyone will checkmark jiwoong or who jiwoong will checkmark ðŸ˜­</p>
