      <p>Aespa have 1 great mini and that's it. They are literally known for having shitty ass besides their full album was absolute trash. IVEs full album is way better</p>

      <p>Twice bsides now are good tho, aesoas besides aren't bad their albums just have 0 cohesiveness and they usually feel rushed and don't match their identity, feels more like random playlists than actual albums, red velvet probably have the single most well thought out album in kpop imo I don't think a single group can match to them</p>

      <p>This is unfortunately all kpop acts sm do have the best actual albums in kpop and I will say wonder girls had a solid one too but even for sm they're pretty lazy since most of their bsides can be switched for every group and it wouldn't make a difference, kpop isn't an actual album or complex music industry</p>

      <p>i disagree with anon cause a lot of the times ppl prefer the groups bside compared to title tracks when it comes to their discography. im someone who loves to listen to any groups albums and dig in but yeah it does get jarring when u realise theres no cohesivity. like yesterday i was just listening to aoa‚Äôs bsides and damn it was all over the place but then you find one random song which is like the best thing ever.</p>

      <p>Yea there's always 1-2 bsides fans will like more than tt the biggest lack is the cohesiveness but I feel like there's still great bsides in most eps
