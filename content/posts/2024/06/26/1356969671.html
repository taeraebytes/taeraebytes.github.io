      <p>with how glued to zerose socials matthew seems to be do we think he's viewed ccs/retrosprings or he wouldn't know about that? like i doubt this place specifically bc it's not linked to twt but maybe that's part of why he seemed so depressed the past few weeks bc not only social media but the lil forums that zeroses/subfandoms have get so crazy ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I don't think he'd venture deep into that except maybe like bigger public accs who post their answers and stuff like I don't post my ccs anywhere so that's the only way he'd see others. And it would be crazy if he deep dived into that like nah... I rlly hope he doesn't but someone scared me once saying he could've seen when that Sofia girl got mad at meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I feel like he's seen a bunch of hate more than opinions like it's very easy to find it on twt and ig I just hope he puts that damn phone down like no more buddy

      <p>Maybe the myseokryudan one but I don't think there's anything spicy or interesting there, in general he gives me the vibes of being very surface level on stantwt like his humour etc doesn't give chronically online</p>

      <p>oh yea he's probably seen that one but yea I don't think he's ever surfed too deeply but idk also he finds stuff with low interactions and there were those rumors swirling last yr that he was interacting on seokryutwt
