      <p>My explanation:

Irene - Yujin: both mid singers who also dance but they are not super proficient dancers either. Sometimes they look bored at the stage. Both visuals that fit the standard. Also both are bunnies.

Yeri-Gyuvin: Mid vocals too, they look lost when they are doing the choreos. Sometimes Yeri talks too much which Gyuvin does too. Both are pretty but get overshadowed by other visuals on their group. 

Seulgi-Hanbin: dancers with tutting as their specialty. Both are lead vocals that sometimes get even as many lines as the main vocals. Some people like their tone, other people dislike their tones. Get favored by their companies a lot. 

Joy - Hao: Visuals that are always complaining about their company and sending shade towards them. If Hao loves getting his jaw done, Joy loves doing the same with her fillers. Can't act. They are allergic to not serving 24/7.

Wendy-Taerae: Main vocals that can be a little bit boring. Sometimes they can be a little cringe. But have a good relationship with all the members although they can be a bit distant sometimes.</p>
