      <p>She was with Stone music a CJ company, that company established OTR which was izone and fromis company for a while, then that got destroyed and all their artists and staff moved to Wakeone. It's all very confusing</p>

      <p>totally not a relevant discussion bc we have no way of knowing this would've even happened and starship and possibly yuehua had an iron grip on getting their izone girls back but this anon got me thinking. bc fromis moved to pledis since han sungsoo (pledis ceo, not sure if he is now tho) was the ceo of otr, idk if he was involved in fromis music but he was definitely involved in izone music, if izone became permanent would they have moved to pledis and therefore eventually become a hybe group? that's a weird alternate reality to think about lmao</p>
