      <p>My explanation:

Irene - Yujin: both mid singers who also dance but they are not super proficient dancers either. Sometimes they look bored at the stage. Both visuals that fit the standard. Also both are bunnies.

Yeri-Gyuvin: Mid vocals too, they look lost when they are doing the choreos. Sometimes Yeri talks too much which Gyuvin does too. Both are pretty but get overshadowed by other visuals on their group. 

Seulgi-Hanbin: dancers with tutting as their specialty. Both are lead vocals that sometimes get even as many lines as the main vocals. Some people like their tone, other people dislike their tones. Get favored by their companies a lot. 

Joy - Hao: Visuals that are always complaining about their company and sending shade towards them. If Hao loves getting his jaw done, Joy loves doing the same with her fillers. Can't act. They are allergic to not serving 24/7.

Wendy-Taerae: Main vocals that can be a little bit boring. Sometimes they can be a little cringe. But have a good relationship with all the members although they can be a bit distant sometimes.</p>

      <p>i wouldn't say tutting is seulgi's specialty like i kinda get what anon is saying but i've heard seulgi started focusing more on dancing during training days bc she had vocal nodules or something like she's mostly just an idol dancer so not really a specific dance style focus like ppl who danced prior to kpop training, this makes it sound like she has the same type of background as hanbin sndfkmskmsdfksdf she only started tutting when preparing for naughty but continued with learning it bc she liked it like she's done various other tutting choreos after. i know it's not that serious but idk i just felt like yapping</p>
