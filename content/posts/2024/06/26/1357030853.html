      <p>Taerae is living in a closet like harry potter and rosins will still look you straight in the eye and tell you the company favours him cause he had a schedule on 110410 while Hao gets to love like a king in Jeju and in his new dorm with his loyal lapdog and his sneaky link🤦‍♀️</p>

      <p>poop puppy was like a nickname his fans gave him and he even used it himself they got so mad when he switched up and asked for it to stop cuz it was supposed to be endearing and he acted like it was bad after using it himself 😭 it def wasn't that he just wanted to change it him suggesting Bambi himself was hilarious
