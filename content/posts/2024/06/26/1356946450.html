      <p>i need them to fully explain the changes they made for the living situation ðŸ˜­ if they stayed in the old dorm so far it sounds like yujin moved to the upper floor and maybe taerae moved to where a manager used to have a room on that floor or like a storage room idk, matt and ricky stayed at the bottom floor and hao2binz moved into a new appartment? i need a room toor omg can jiwoong fake living in the living room or something so that we can get some proper dorm content</p>

      <p>Definitely a new floor, rn it looks like hao2binz moved into the new one and they probably did after their holiday but it was decided a long time ago (Hao buying a table and calling Hanbin) taerae moved into the dressing room in the upper floor, gunwook kept his room and yujin took cheonanzs, Ricky and Matthew still live downstairs with the possibility of Gyuvin being there but I heavily doubt it since Matthew and Ricky were together while Gyuvin has been pretty consistently crashing haobins lives</p>
