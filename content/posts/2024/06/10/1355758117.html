      <p>3/4 other members are almost 180 which is already pretty tall esp compared to average height in korea but gunwook would be considered really tall literally anywhere ðŸ˜­ and itâ€™s not a bad thing</p>

      <p>oh no yujin and jiwoong are way shorter than their official heights so is hanbin they're a lot smaller irl especiallyyy jiwoong so like a 3+ inch difference is big I didn't say it's a bad thing but let's pick up some new vocab it's annoying

      <p>Even outside yujin jiwoong and Hanbin hao Ricky guubin and gunwook are all for sure over 180 so that's still 4, and those three while noticeable smaller aren't that far from hao either , they're a tall ass group</p>

      <p>They're a lot smaller if you yourself are tall like it's rlly just that also the illusions some of them play are just so much more noticeable but the tall members are still really tall
