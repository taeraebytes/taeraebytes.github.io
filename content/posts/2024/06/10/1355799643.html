      <p>Fashion anon just said rumors abt a member (or duo) getting a luxury brand and for one we know hanbin has a magazine shoot and if the rumor is right which they said we'll know by next week the timing kinda matches ü§î they also said the member have worked with the brand already so it includes hanbin and jiwoong for gucci (hao ricky can be counted too) and hao yujin for loewe (they had a schedule today too so ü§î)</p>
