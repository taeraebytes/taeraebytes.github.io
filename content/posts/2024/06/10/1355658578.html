      <p>was reading all the praises in run run cover and one comment said that they didnt know jebiwon are this talented and handsome but why they arent that popular and someone replied 'sadly because their songs arent good' üòê

And I saw someone else say that they know of zb1 because of they have a chinese centre and that they didnt expect a group that has a chinese centre be this good üò≠ and the replies called them out obv 

a lot of praises for hariboz for their pronunciation and lot of people were like I get why hao is the center etc etc And so many praises about their vocals and visuals from non fans and non kpop fans in general....I truly truly wish wakeone promotes them strategically next time that gets them both those broadcast points and appeal to nonfans like it seems like a lot of these nonfans have pre assumed opinions about them like JUST CHECK THEM OUT YOURSELVES</p>
