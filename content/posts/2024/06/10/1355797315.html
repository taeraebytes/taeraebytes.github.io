      <p>if we are being real, rosins being upset about studio choom is ridiculous bc what made them think that he even got a chance when there's gunwook and even matthew and yujin on the group ðŸ˜­. like the only chance ZH would have is a mix and max with hanbin and if that happened they would be whining too.</p>

      <p>you people are dumb as fuck, most people arent upset because they want that schedule for their bias they're upset because he keeps getting big solo gigs back to back from cj while offers for their bias are being declined by wakeone and cj isnt doing shit to promote him... use your fucking brains for once and if yall who stan mid singers can ask for vocal content so can other fans ask for dance content, annoying ass hoes</p>
