      <p>if we are being real, rosins being upset about studio choom is ridiculous bc what made them think that he even got a chance when there's gunwook and even matthew and yujin on the group ğŸ˜­. like the only chance ZH would have is a mix and max with hanbin and if that happened they would be whining too.</p>
