      <p>some people from onehallyu moved to hallyuplus and i think there are threads there that are like the most popular ones from onehallyu (plastic surgery as one example) but idk how active that whole website is.... i never really went on it but i know allkpop and maybe soompi had forums, not sure how active those are either or if they're even still up</p>

      <p>Allkpop and onehallyu was so interesting i was kinda late into it, but sadly a lot of the interesting posters closed cause  theyd been around for decades and at that point HAD to move on ðŸ˜­ One of the gossip thread runners had a grandchild on the way and said that was their cue to move on in life lmaoooo.</p>
