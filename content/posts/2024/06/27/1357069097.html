      <p>He's not balding gunwook has some of the thickest hair ever but he's getting undercuts tooo frequently and they're getting cut rlly high like the shaved part will be reaching the curve of his head AT THAT POINT THAYS NOT AN UNDERCUT YOU ARE SCALPING HIM... but gunwooks hair grows sooo fast it'll go away in a week or twoðŸ˜­
