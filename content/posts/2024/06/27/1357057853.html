      <p>I had this thought cause I was putting zb1 pics in the idol look alike thing and gunwook hao taerae yujin always have the same hair styles it's fine for yujin and taerae cause it fits them but the constant bangs are kinda a shame for people with eyebrows as great as gunhao, for gunwook his face also looks a lot sharper without the bangs</p>
