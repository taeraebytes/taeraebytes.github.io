      <p>I had this thought cause I was putting zb1 pics in the idol look alike thing and gunwook hao taerae yujin always have the same hair styles it's fine for yujin and taerae cause it fits them but the constant bangs are kinda a shame for people with eyebrows as great as gunhao, for gunwook his face also looks a lot sharper without the bangs</p>

      <p>hao is one of the rare idols I find more good looking predebut I'm actually not against longer hair for him but I think his eyebrows must be visible and dark its one of his best facial feature like if he gets longer hair it should be styled like sunghoon if he gets shorter he should rock his predebut hair his current hair isn't bad it's just pretty bland which is a shame when he has sharp features 
For Gunwook I actually don't mind the bangs but I prefer them to be a bit see through the mushroom cut really isn't the way to go for him cause his face looks too round while having his eyebrows visible gives him sharpness (also he has gorgeous brows) bp first ep is still his best hairstyle but I loved those curtain bangs they gave him during this era it's perfect and frame his face well
I actually also heavily prefer hanbin without bangs but if he does have bangs I prefer them to be a bit thicker and wavy for example the Christmas stage</p>

      <p>I'm ngl sameeeee even last yr I found him more attractive idk ðŸ˜­ but yea I feel like he needs to have a clearer place for his brows I don't notice them anymore even for gunwook which is crazy. But I really love bangs on gunwook so that's why I'm not too mad but I do miss when they'd switch it up but I've hated EVERYTHING ABOUT FTP ERA IT WAS TERRIBLE... I would die for ep 1 bp hair tho 
I think wispy bangs are cute on him but he has a nice forehead they should utilize it more and no more crazy ass aegyosal makeup
