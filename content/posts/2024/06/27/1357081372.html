      <p>My 2 moots who are Hao stans went to the fansigns twice and said that Gyuvin shocked them the most cos he was sauur good-looking. Yes, better than hanbin. hanbin is just photogenic and telegenic while gyuvin & hao looks waaay better in real life, esp gyuvin. Small delicate face. Yujin looks like a typical cute teenager. His makeup is always on point and the camera really loves him but he looks better than hanbin. Jiwoong is really handsome apparently üò≠</p>
