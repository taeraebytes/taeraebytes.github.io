      <p>I had this thought cause I was putting zb1 pics in the idol look alike thing and gunwook hao taerae yujin always have the same hair styles it's fine for yujin and taerae cause it fits them but the constant bangs are kinda a shame for people with eyebrows as great as gunhao, for gunwook his face also looks a lot sharper without the bangs</p>

      <p>yujin would pull off so many hairstyles if only his hairline was good ðŸ˜­ like his forehead is pretty but whether its because he has thinner hair or is balding his hairline is too high and thats why they always do that cover up hairstyles aka the mushroom hair but k girlies dig it and its their ideal hairstyle on male idols so thats prob why gunhao always do that hairstyle as well but same I wished I could see their forehead more often</p>

      <p>best hairline and forehead imo

gunwook and ricky they both have nice thick hairline and at the perfect spot not too high not too low. Ricky got a good brow bone so I'm happy he never covers it and imo its one of his best features, his tzone is so distinct in kpop I love it. Gunwook tzone is weaker but its still noticeable and I love it when he does that half bangs up half down hairstyle like its chef kiss. both can pull off slick backs without looking weird or awkward

jiwoong has a good hairline but he pisses me off so i dont wanna talk about him but ill acknowledge his hairline and forehead

matthew has a good hairline and forehead and when his hair is up it takes the attention away from his other imo kinda flawed features so thats a good thing

taerae hao have nice hairlines too but honestly I prefer them with bangs down or just a middle/ side split because I think it fits and compliments their features more but they can easily be higher than matthew this just my personal taste

Hanbins hairline and forehead is good but I think its his eyebrows that throws me off like he just looks mean when his eyebrows shows so imo he looks better with bangs down and it compliments his other features too

yujin I don't think I ever seen his entire hairline so I cant give my opinion and if what anon says is true then thats why he's at the bottom but he has features that can pull off hair up 

gyuvin hairline receding and forehead too big so just cover it and he looks good when its covered</p>

      <p>Ngl I used to think gunwooks forehead was so small I still do but his hairline is so full and nice Ricky too he has cute baby hairs damnnn maybe we do need to see slickbacks


ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Matthew suits wispy long hair like that one award show he looked leng and even in that regent trio selfie the hair looked rlly good 

Sorry taerae need to keep them bangs down they haven't figured out how to make him not have a boxy head with hair up idk but I like when hao has the dynamic hair that's up the one he blew up for 

Hanbin can start to look kindaaaa strong and mad? Idk he just looks so much less softer but I kinda like it I feel like it's just the aegyosal they do too much on

I wish he had a nice hairline he'd look cute with hair up 

and gyuvin yea buddy it's joever
