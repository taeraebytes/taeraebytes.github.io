      <p>not even being a schizo rosin but i do think mnet is setting him up to be their replacement of kd as their main host or something of the sort ( i send a cc about this before) he will probably stay in his current company but thereâ€™s going to be a cooperation between them and mnet and it seems like there already is, well idk that much about bada but ik sheâ€™s on mnet pluschat and what person willingly goes there unless they are mnet affiliates</p>

      <p>No I see it too I always kinda predicted he'd go into variety and focus on dance rather than be a solo artists or redebut in a group so it would make sense if he ever hosted smf/swf
