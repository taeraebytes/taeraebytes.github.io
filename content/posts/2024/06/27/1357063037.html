      <p>hao suggested the run run cover after watching lovely runner. i'm afraid he even suggested the distribution since he has good grasp of other members' voice. but i thought the distribution is quite fair. the camera just didn't capture the main vocals Haorae singing their parts in that video with 1.2M views</p>
