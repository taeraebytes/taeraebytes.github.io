      <p>Lowkey a certain idol giving blank answers to their fans and looking disinterested and mad is worse than accidentallly getting caught swearing. Cause what jiwoong did is what a lot of idol/workers would do (not saying hes totally in the right) at the end of schedules it was just unlucky.</p>

      <p>LITERALLY IT IS NOTðŸ˜­ I mean yea jiwoong wasn't as unresponsive during the call but he said fuck when calls go in between and he let the fan hear it and that's worse imo I know we wish it didn't happen but it was pretty bad just cu it's more common for idols to be disinterested rather than hearing someone say fuck like I'm sure sungchan will get flack but he can move past it cuz sayinf fuck is like sealing a doom deal

      <p>i think ultimately swearing was bad but ppl would have gotten over it. its the lack of sincere apology and shenanigans after that did it. so i have to disagree with anon, cause what jw and wk1 did to handle it couldnt allow for any benefit of the doubt, but a disinterested idol can be excused and will be moved past</p>

      <p>Right it could've been handled and out of the way if jiwoong and wakeone did the right thing but they didn't and they doubled down NUMEROUS.. times like it's like their goal was to ruin zb1. And I agree you can move on from disinterest much easier than cursing

      <p>my pr plan at the time was so...  jiwoong get dispatch to give a teary release about his dog dying that day with ai generated pics for proof, jw gives a written hand apology, dispatch release meeting of the fan and jw where jw begs for apology and then gives donation to charity. WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL HAGWOONG.</p>
