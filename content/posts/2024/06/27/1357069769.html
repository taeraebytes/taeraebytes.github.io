      <p>not even being a schizo rosin but i do think mnet is setting him up to be their replacement of kd as their main host or something of the sort ( i send a cc about this before) he will probably stay in his current company but thereâ€™s going to be a cooperation between them and mnet and it seems like there already is, well idk that much about bada but ik sheâ€™s on mnet pluschat and what person willingly goes there unless they are mnet affiliates</p>

      <p>No I see it too I always kinda predicted he'd go into variety and focus on dance rather than be a solo artists or redebut in a group so it would make sense if he ever hosted smf/swf

      <p>I hope not pls tr thrives in groups so much more with his personality like ballad singers can't even do variety and stuff it'd be the biggest loss</p>

      <p>this cc as well as the cc about how zb1 should go in the run run cover direction in their own music made me realise that yura yura is probably the closest theyâ€™ve got (i mean duh, as typing this i remember thereâ€™s band scenes in the mv) to the band stuff that fits taerae and itâ€™s also my fav title track of theirs so letâ€™s get yura yura 2.0 for the next comeback</p>
