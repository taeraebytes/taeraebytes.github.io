      <p>I had this thought cause I was putting zb1 pics in the idol look alike thing and gunwook hao taerae yujin always have the same hair styles it's fine for yujin and taerae cause it fits them but the constant bangs are kinda a shame for people with eyebrows as great as gunhao, for gunwook his face also looks a lot sharper without the bangs</p>

      <p>yujin would pull off so many hairstyles if only his hairline was good ðŸ˜­ like his forehead is pretty but whether its because he has thinner hair or is balding his hairline is too high and thats why they always do that cover up hairstyles aka the mushroom hair but k girlies dig it and its their ideal hairstyle on male idols so thats prob why gunhao always do that hairstyle as well but same I wished I could see their forehead more often</p>

      <p>This is actually his biggest drawback as a visual it's not even his personality ðŸ˜­he will need to sport that mushroom hair well into his 40s</p>

      <p>I think so too like being able to have most of ur face showing is a must hes getting drowned out by his bangs especially since he has a zika head
