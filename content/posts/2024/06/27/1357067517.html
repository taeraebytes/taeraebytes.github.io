      <p>hao suggested the run run cover after watching lovely runner. i'm afraid he even suggested the distribution since he has good grasp of other members' voice. but i thought the distribution is quite fair. the camera just didn't capture the main vocals Haorae singing their parts in that video with 1.2M views</p>

      <p>because he understands music and by now, he can tell the range of his members and knows who would fit the lines. it's like him suggesting that hanbin sing that GFriend song which hanbin didn't like at first but it was the song he sang the best and he was praised for it. Giving your suggestions isn't criminal.  üò≠ He done these things in Boys Planet</p>
