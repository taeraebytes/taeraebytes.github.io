      <p>Lol, the way Pannchao writes headlines for HYBE group, TWS, and ZB1 for foul encores or songs is hilarious because RIIZE is being pulled harshly by knetizens, but the title she used is so basic that bitch is certainly on SM payroll. Similarly, in the BND jaehyun and attitude dispute, she used an article with about 15 comments titled "Netizens laughed at bnd and riize interaction" despite the fact that there are several posts discussing riize attitude with far greater interaction. It's fairly clear she's on SM payroll.</p>

      <p>Yea I find it hard to believe but also she does have enough of a crazy pull to change intl fan narratives BUT her hate for sm goes deep and it's been around for over a decade she's a sad lady I doubt she randomly likes sm she's just a nasty spirit tbh
