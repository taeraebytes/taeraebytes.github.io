      <p>not to bring bad vibes here but the fact that zb1 got a room upgrade is freaking me out BAD… maybe it’s because im a former orbit and they gave all the girls dorm upgrades before literally everything went to shit it’s like something kind of nice happens to lure you into a false sense of security then BOOM some stupid shit happens and the group is finished</p>
