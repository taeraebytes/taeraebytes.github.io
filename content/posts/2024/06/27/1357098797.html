that's why c-gyubrikers started to dare to ask things like this in front of them. not only gyubrikers, but most riyangis on the quote also rejoice about this question. their deluluness are accommodated by shimkongz though and they gain many new shippers because of this. same on j-side, there are many rikiraba who ship gyubrick. i've seen a lot of their twit mentioning shimkongz. so that's good maneuver from gyuvin to keep feeding this shipper.</p>

they asked ricky and he seemed agreed. who said he is not queerbaiting with gyubrickers? both of them pushing the ship so hard made the shipper shoved this kind of question on their face. waiting for shanghai fanssign to see how craziest shit they will be asked until they become haobin 2.0 or maybe that what they want. dgaf about riyangis/i-gyubrickers critizm about this matter, they enjoyed it since before only now they protested it after they failed to pushed them doin that cha.</p>

 like even I feel bad for him cuz it's clear he doesn't like the whole shipping thing esp if he has to be the weak fragile princess they want him to be in that ship. Shippers kept asking him every fansign so he said he'll only do it if he's the male part but op tricked him cuz he doesn't know the choreo so he's actually a victim ðŸ˜­</p>
