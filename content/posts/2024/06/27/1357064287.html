      <p>Twice bsides now are good tho, aesoas besides aren't bad their albums just have 0 cohesiveness and they usually feel rushed and don't match their identity, feels more like random playlists than actual albums, red velvet probably have the single most well thought out album in kpop imo I don't think a single group can match to them</p>

      <p>This is unfortunately all kpop acts sm do have the best actual albums in kpop and I will say wonder girls had a solid one too but even for sm they're pretty lazy since most of their bsides can be switched for every group and it wouldn't make a difference, kpop isn't an actual album or complex music industry</p>

      <p>idk i feel like most kpop albums that i've heard aren't cohesive at all which is sad bc even if the songs are really good it still doesn't feel complete in a way? like fully satisfactory? rv's new mini album feels really cohesive in sound imo tho i think rv has other cohesive works too which i'm thankful for (rbb for eg) like it all feels intentional rather than just getting random songs from random producers and throwing them together (like most of le sserafim's stuff or kinda yhmah for eg). not quite kpop in the sense that it wouldn't be considered idol work but rm right place wrong person and jhope jack in the box are really cohesive to me as well. it's not much of a thing in music in general but i wish there were kpop albums where all the songs basically transitioned into each other too like beyonce renaissance... oh well. guess i gotta dream since clearly none of this shit is happening all that much</p>

      <p>i think gidles i burn (hwaa) is a very cohesive mini and the b sides are all quality. maybe even i love (nxde) but there are 2 songs that are a little too bright and the vibe of the album & title are kind of eerie so imo to make it a 10/10 id replace those 2 with 2 b sides from the tomboy album. but yeah its hard to find cohesive albums in kpop. i think stayc and fromis also have good a&r</p>

      <p>they write their own music so it's obvious that they'll be more cohesive. Soyeon thinks of a concept then asks yuqi and minnie to write songs according to the direction of the concept.soyeon will say no if it's not within the conceot she created. that little woman is something else</p>

      <p>anon who was talking about rv's album cohesion here, svt also write their own music but their albums aren't that cohesive either (other than a few like henggarae or al1 off the top of my head) so i think it just depends on the group. gidle and svt def have different music processes bc i remember years ago woozi said something about how he has hundreds of unused songs and i'm p sure it's either a fan theory or even confirmed by members (i remember there was a song released in recent years that woozi had made back in 2019 but idk what one it was) that sometimes - i think mostly for b-sides - they'll release/record vocals for songs that were made years ago</p>
