      <p>hao suggested the run run cover after watching lovely runner. i'm afraid he even suggested the distribution since he has good grasp of other members' voice. but i thought the distribution is quite fair. the camera just didn't capture the main vocals Haorae singing their parts in that video with 1.2M views</p>

      <p>he's not? he has one short chorus line, then in the middle of it 6 second shared lined with yujin and then a 3 second line at the end I'm sorry but even yujin sang more because his beginning line is literally longer than all of taerae's parts combined</p>
