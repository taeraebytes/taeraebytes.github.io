      <p>Dream are worse because everyone except haechan and mark are underdeveloped and haechan and mark are worse than wonbin even (and no one come in talking about their "high notes" they all sing those high notes with unhealthy incorrect technique)</p>

      <p>stability comes with practice but riize are pretty stable i think they were just hella nervous some of the riize members seemed like they were going to shit themselves in the encore which honestly is fair bc encores get scrutinized to hell and back and there is no backtrack to safety net on. i watch some of their content and they usually practice the choreo while singing and they sound good, or at the very least decent and stable</p>
