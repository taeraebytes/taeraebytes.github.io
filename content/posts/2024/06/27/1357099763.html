      <p>I have no clue tbh Ollie's been so separated from the other yuehuaz and he was sent back to china immediately after getting eliminated and pushed into cent I saw yuehua do some new years calendar with their Chinese artists and he was there too I feel like they won't especially if they decided to put hao in the group Ollie will be their Chinese cash cow instead. He's in a temporary survival show group as their center rn anyways
