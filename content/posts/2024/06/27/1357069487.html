      <p>I mean itâ€™s subjective. Diff anon, i saw them last year in France and Hanbin really looks like a prince irl btw this is my opinion of them. Also fyi beauty/visuals are subjective so pls donâ€™t take it to heart :-
1. Gyuvin : very tall, my eyes went to him and gw first as soon as they entered. I just donâ€™t fuck w his nose but tbh he can be a visual cause his proportions are really nice.
2. Yujin: looks like a doll he really had a glow up after bp and easily one of the top visuals. 
3. Hao: is much taller than I thought and more cutee irl too
4. Taerae : sorry didnâ€™t notice him, he looks handsome too but not noticeable enough around zb1. If he was tall heâ€™d be talked about a lot more I think.
5. Jw: never liked him but he stunned me he looks very handsome and gives off very cold male lead vibes with his straight face. Also, he knows heâ€™s handsome you can just tell ðŸ˜­
6. Hanbin: wasnâ€™t in my bias list but he became my bias after this. I think his visuals are perfectly my taste. He looks so handsome and he has very clean prince like visuals. It looks like heâ€™s glowing from within and has a halo on his head sjdhsjks 
7. Gw: heâ€™s tall af too and nicely built unlike gyuvin who is a bit leaner. I think gw gyuvin catches your eyes first their physique is really nice. And gw is also a lot cuter than I thought - heâ€™s a different type of cute like more of a handsome cute type rather than cutesy cute (idk if that makes sense)
8. Matthew - heâ€™s cute but didnâ€™t notice him a lot visual wise and he seemed shorter than I thought. But he has a very endearing look.
9. Ricky : heâ€™s not my type at all but wow he really has the ai visuals. I realised ricky is the type that even if you donâ€™t bias him you just have to gasp and scream whenever his face shows up on the big screen. He got the loudest cheers too everyone was gagged.

My fav visuals were hanbin, jiwoong and Yujin and btw I was sitting with other fans, they started asking about Hanbin when he was mcing.</p>

      <p>No I get it everyone's different beauty is subjective and I think it also comes down to type I don't think anyone in the group is ugly just more about who suits my taste yeaaa we're pretty similar
