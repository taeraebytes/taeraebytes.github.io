that's why c-gyubrikers started to dare to ask things like this in front of them. not only gyubrikers, but most riyangis on the quote also rejoice about this question. their deluluness are accommodated by shimkongz though and they gain many new shippers because of this. same on j-side, there are many rikiraba who ship gyubrick. i've seen a lot of their twit mentioning shimkongz. so that's good maneuver from gyuvin to keep feeding this shipper.</p>
