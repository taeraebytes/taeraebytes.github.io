      <p>I feel like if the produce scandal hadn't happened he would still be pushed but not as heavily I mean his introduction in the first episode was legitimately ridiculous ðŸ˜­ I was actually thinking recently that only hao would've made it as a foreigner and gyujin would be top 2 if we followed produce formulz</p>

      <p>I never watched any of the produce series so I couldn't say but 100% even the bp producers had no interest in Ricky ðŸ˜­ but majority of the group would've still made it since they were all producer picks

      <p>Wonyoung wasn't actually the it girl during produce and Izone. It was Sakura. Wonyoung got her crown in Ive, but has to share it with Yujin coz gp prefers her fun personality. For them, yujin approachable and Wonyoung isn't. Yeah, I agree. Queens shouldn't be reachable by mere mortals</p>

      <p>Uhn uhn cause I was there and off the record never promoted Sakura like that the main enemy was Minju because she got center push and was rivaling Wonyoung in terms of fan reception but even then Korean gp didnâ€™t gaf abt Sakura like that and they still donâ€™t</p>

      <p>wonyoung, sakura, minju were iz*one's rotating centers which is why i was so confused at the beginning of zb1 when rosins were losing it over people saying we might have more than just hao center too... remember when that one person tweeted that yujin would be the next center and they got jumped whole time they were right</p>
