      <p>rosins need to stop putting words into haos mouth. he was saying he is wk1 prince, zb1 prince obviously being cj prince would be next. he joked because that would never happen because cj is just too big of a company. the person most likely to be cj prince is wk1 prince (=hao). he was just joking around but rosins seem keen set on trying to set him up ðŸ˜‘</p>

      <p>I was about to say his fans are what actively make him unlikeable, when you look at just him as a person he's a cool chill dude but his fans actively make him into a shitty person for some reason I think it's the first time I've seen it in kpop</p>

      <p>I used to like hao so much but his fans are so insufferable like not on a normal level I think it's possible to like someone even with terrible fans but they make it impossible like SERIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE I was so tolerant for months but it kinda just got worse and he had to be let go sowwy he's still cool tho

      <p>Yeah fans definitely spoil the enjoyment of the artists I can't stand Nicki or Taylor swift anymore like don't listen to their songs at all same for kpop I got turned off by bts and loona even tho I was a Stan of both, now I'm getting turned off by aespa, I think zh is legitimately one of the most impressive idols we've had in years but I'm not interested in consuming any of his content when his fans are so insufferable like I had to mute his name, it was the same for Hanbin during debut era but his fans are not nearly as annoying as rosins now so were cool again</p>

      <p>Orbit culture is just harassing people for years being proven wrong about the reason they thought their harassment was justifiable pretending they didn't do shit rinse repeat omg Jaden jeong and his gay boygroup really went through it insane harassment for such a small fansom</p>
