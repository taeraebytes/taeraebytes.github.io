      <p>Not it was bp contestants!! They filmed the theme song way before the show even started, I was there!!! And I do think it was kinda shitty towards the ggroup tbh unlike the p48 theme song, but there was a double center highlight moment at least</p>

      <p>wow remember daeul he was almost our gyuvin.... actually now that we're talking about it half of gyuvin's issues come from the fact that he didnt get the sohye untalented but loveable edit like he would get dragged way less and his fans wouldnt be deluded about his talents if he was packaged that way off rip people love a clear dozen even of theyre troll stanning</p>

      <p>Lol the reason why a lot of us preshow stans voted for daeul was cause of his ending fairy his smiled seemed endearing ðŸ˜­we then saw the first episode. Zhang Hao and Matt had zero hype back then Matthew wasn't even pretty disliked before the payola accusations zh then got the heterophoria screen time and legitimately great live performer buff (over me is THE reason he won p01) and Matthew had the screentime, cute personality and jfans buff his jay mark cover was also really good I think it was the most memorable performance of the first episode</p>

      <p>Everything falls into place for Hao. The hype that zerohour payola made for him was crazy. People highly anticipated his performance because of the leak and the drama. This is a rare situation where I believe in destiny. Hao destined to win despite the big push that the whole production is giving hanbin. Had they not exposed for rigging before, hanbin would definitely be P01. So yeah, we watched how destiny played</p>

      <p>Bruh why did they make over me look so good the real thing was a scam in terms of lighting and shit. Also besides Ricky and Zhanghao unpopular opinion but the song would be way better with other contestants</p>
