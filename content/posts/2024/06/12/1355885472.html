      <p>I acc think Matthew seems way more nice/caring than Gyuvin does (like heâ€™s usually portrayed/perceived to be).. Gyuvin is obviously a very nice guy w no seriously bad intentions but Matthew seems like a more sincere genuine guy and less manipulative than Gyuvin. Like the way he talks to fans at fansigns and heâ€™s never ignored a single member idk itâ€™s rlly sweetðŸ˜£</p>

      <p>I agree matthew is more sincere also because he's emotionally intelligent gyuvin is nice and goofy but idt he has attention to detail or the intelligence to recognize and act according to emotion he's more of a mess while matthrw does wow I just teared up he's so sweet

      <p>He has a very similar chart to do young, I haven't looked at either in depth like the aspects and everything but he's a lot more smart and strategic guy than you might think he's very purposeful with the way he portrays himself which doesn't make him his connection or him as a person not genuine btw</p>

      <p>I promise I came in right as you replied I wasn't just waiting ðŸ˜­I meant WONYOUNG not do young it was autocorrect I was looking through their charts again and noticed it cause you guys mentioned that gyuvin looked like he had a crush on her lol I'm mentioning it cause obviously wonyoung is known to be very controlling about her image</p>

      <p>I just went to look at both of their charts again and they have the same sun, moon, mercury, Venus, mars, Jupiter Saturn etc wow but they aspect completely differently I'm not gonna analyse their charts cause I guess no one cares but you can tell gyuvin id more run by his emotions while wonyoung is more multifaceted</p>
