      <p>yeah theyre pretty even right now and depends on demographic. wonyoung is really popular with girls and her fanbase is almost entirely girls, shes really popular in korea, japan and fans from ioi where karina i'd say her fanbase is pretty even between female and male fans and shes popular in korea and china and has sm stans.

but ever since wonyoung went on that show with the 3 konglish dudes (iirc this is literally her first solo schedule since ive ðŸ’€) she got mad gp virality and gained some male fans too cuz they found out she actually had a personality and not just a pretty face and they really liked it. GIVE WONY SCHEDULES NOW !</p>

      <p>lets just be completely honest the only person calling karina a it girl are MYâ€™s whilst everyone knows Wonyoung is the it girl. i do think karina is more popular in other ways like she has bigger fandom and maybe even potential to grow , but i dont see the impact or influence she has. wonyoung is constantly a hot topic no matter what she does</p>

      <p>I think amongst Korean winrina are pretty interchangeable fame wise kinda like it's debatable who between haobin is number one amongst kfans, I feel like winter visuals are more widely accepted while Karinas are more controversial but Karina is probably a little more famous still and embodies aespa a lot better, i see winter getting the wider go way more easily though If she follows the IU route</p>

      <p>Karina is more of a hot girl than winter so that's her bump and I feel like winters visuals have been soooo good as of late while karinas we're always ahead of the group

      <p>Every kpop idols gets Hella surgeries but Karina is just more known for it for some reason any discussion about a tired beauty trend or recent beauty standards they don't like on kforums and twt they will bring Karina while they see winter as more natural, that's her one huge block</p>
