      <p>No I don't mind receiving them it keeps me updated but I'd rather remain active than have stuff pile up. When I was taking breaks for my finals it wasn't that bad idk what happened but this is my worst influx ever like worse than the expose thread influxes I'm actually getting pissed offðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ might take a super long break like a month or smth just to shake off these annoying ppl idk or go to rs for a bit I enjoy cc but I can only tolerate so muchðŸ˜‘
