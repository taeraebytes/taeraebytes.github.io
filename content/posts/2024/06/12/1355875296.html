      <p>i truly think that our akgae problem is so bad because alot of these people stan their bias because they hate hao/hanbin. stanning the other makes it easy for them go hate the other. they obviously keep up with the member they hate, it looks like obsession and alot of token stanning to me</p>

      <p>It is a lot of token stanning they're rivals and fighting for the number 1 spot it's just participating in a war for who can be better

      <p>I think the numbers of akgaes internationally and in Korea is a lot smaller than we think the fans are just loud asfk, look at the interactions in literally any haobin tweet even censored ones this might hurt some of y'alls egos but their branding is a lot stronger as a ship than as solo idols🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>I think we notice akgaes in this space a lot because a lot anons bring those drama here. Unless our biases are shaded by akgaes on a platform where the chances of the members seeing is big (eg mnet plus) or a big hit tweet or spamming YouTube comments with hate, it's best to ignore. Akgaes will keep yapping. It's their job to be complaining all the time. It's not just rosins or allins, woongdogies and riyangis akgaes are equally insufferable too (they're not big subfandom tho) but since a lot of rosins camp here, a lot of unnecessary akgae drama surrounding him are brought into attention here.</p>

      <p>it's always been like that in my cc no matter how much I try to curb it but it's also because I've had issues with both akgae sfs myself it's just more apparent but I always recognize it's the loud minority. Idt I'll ever have beef with riyangi akgaes but it would be crazy if it happened loolllllllll

Hanbin is my bias and he has had to read and see lots of disgusting comments coming from akgaes and when he replied back with a kind comment he got called fake and that he tried to reverse the hate to his member so yeah it's fuck akgaes in all ways and fuck rosins too</p>
