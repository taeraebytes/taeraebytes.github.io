      <p>well triples mainly works in subunits that fans vote for, and full group cbs arent common (even this cb they took split promos into two groups). most the fans stan the girls who get most lines, the less talented members are the younger and newer ones who really dont have a lot of fans at all. they reveal their nft-like pc sales for every member every now and again and its diabolical. but its the uniqueness of all this that makes me stan tbh i find it interesting</p>

      <p>I dont really stan triples but Kotone was one of my favs in gp999, i dont think shes that popular in the group but its cool coincidence they were both in the same gp99 team now debuted together</p>

      <p>No, actually a lot of members are not close not like craziness u see in zb1, theres too many. the older members r the most sociable, but the newer girls and older girls kinda have their own clique in terms of closeness</p>
