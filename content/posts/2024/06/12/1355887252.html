      <p>well triples mainly works in subunits that fans vote for, and full group cbs arent common (even this cb they took split promos into two groups). most the fans stan the girls who get most lines, the less talented members are the younger and newer ones who really dont have a lot of fans at all. they reveal their nft-like pc sales for every member every now and again and its diabolical. but its the uniqueness of all this that makes me stan tbh i find it interesting</p>
