      <p>Oh girl it's a mess they did a 27 min video trying to debunk the plagiarism claims but it was incredibly unprofessional and was extremely badly received 
For ex they had screenshots that were visibly from dcgal ðŸ˜­
They brought back the mexican gg newjeans plagiarism accusations (the gg recently showed love to nj and it's weird to do in general)
They tried to claim a nj choreo that was released before love me like this plagiarized it
They tried to claim nj took from bp aiyl uniform concept which yg ex artistic director publicly disagreed with 
They called bp concept untouchable, I've concept dolls and nj concept pedobait basically ðŸ˜­ they're DONE</p>

      <p>There's no way they do this shit with actual intention of helping illit like there's no way... LIKE PUBLICLY CALLING NJNS PEDOBAIT IS NOT HELPING ILLITðŸ˜­

      <p>honestly if i was illits parents i would just sue and make them leave atp like the korean public might even support them for it. none of them have established fanbases like lsrfm to fall back on so having this huge hit on their rep as rookies is just gonna follow them forever</p>
