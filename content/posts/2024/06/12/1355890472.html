      <p>No I don't mind receiving them it keeps me updated but I'd rather remain active than have stuff pile up. When I was taking breaks for my finals it wasn't that bad idk what happened but this is my worst influx ever like worse than the expose thread influxes I'm actually getting pissed off😭😭😭😭 might take a super long break like a month or smth just to shake off these annoying ppl idk or go to rs for a bit I enjoy cc but I can only tolerate so much😑

      <p>I totally get you tbh the topics have been getting so weird recently a lot of ppl dont bring fun gossip like before or new convos, just recycled akgae or zb1twt talk. i guess the issue with cc is that you can reply in a thread, which means ppl just keep dragging on the same talk, rs is better you cant create threads, if someone has someone to say they can leave a comment, so u (rqfm) dont have to reply to it.</p>

      <p>oh yall have no idea 😭😭😭 it's a literal echo chamber they're so delusional and mentally ill it's scary i tried to scroll through the second one a few days ago and i genuinely got scared, like im not saying everyone in this cc are saints but at least we have different opinions, and queef tries to reply to diff people to be fair and tries to give logical arguments even if she gets annoyed easily, this person and their anons are just pysch ward escapees who have convinced themselves hanbin is a god and better than every other member in everything and they're all leeching off him and whatever they get is payola but he's the only one in demand and they never reply to ccs clocking them just "yes exactly" to whoever agrees with them, and they think hao is this evil terrible dozen who thinks he's all that and his fans gas him up like i could go on but omfg it's crazy in there bottom line is take your meds everyone hating strangers this much is genuinely a disease.</p>

And yea I try to be fair why else would I argue with half the ppl here and subject myself to irkness but like they're reaching levels of insanity we could never touch over there it's INSANE

      <p>Janghaneul is connected to this cc so she's a bit exposed in reality. You should invite those allins to check this cc too regularly. Some of your anons are lying, but there are some facts that people need to see. Whenever I see Rosins here, I'm glad that they're here (even if it pisses you off) but at least, they're having reality check. I'm on both Allin and Rosins X spaces so I know that the echo chamber in Allins is so bad that you would think the the world only has hanbin. They want everything for hanbin. In Rosins case, they have better awareness of things and they just don't want anyone to touch what belongs to Zhang Hao and hate everyone who hates him. If you see Rosins here that irk you, please don't reply 😭. Just let them stay here so they can learn more and share them to their X moots. I don't want an echo chamber like what allins have.</p>

      <p>jang is my close friend she'll always be connected to me and idc only she's allowed to irk me nobody else is tho!!!!! But ur right rosins are definitely so much more aware than allins I think that's what makes it worse LIKE THEYRE ALMOST THERE THATS WHAT MAKES IT MORE ANNOYING and it's the fact that on a chill day they're fine I've always had rosins in my cc but they only started irking really bad since April. But yea I'm actually going to try to stop replying I just am a stickler for trying to be fair and letting everyone speak I joke that my cc is a dictatorship but I can't help but post shit that makes even me mad

      <p>It's just so sad that majority of Rosins are actually smart on how they view things, but there's this loud af minority going around tarnishing Rosins reputation. Not to be racist, but it's disappointing that most, if not all of them are Indonesians. They're worst than Chinese akgaes. I always imagine Zeroseville without those Indonesian Haobin akgaes... We're probably a more peaceful fandom. I want to cry.</p>
