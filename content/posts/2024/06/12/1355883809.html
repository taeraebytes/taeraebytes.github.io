      <p>No I don't mind receiving them it keeps me updated but I'd rather remain active than have stuff pile up. When I was taking breaks for my finals it wasn't that bad idk what happened but this is my worst influx ever like worse than the expose thread influxes I'm actually getting pissed off😭😭😭😭 might take a super long break like a month or smth just to shake off these annoying ppl idk or go to rs for a bit I enjoy cc but I can only tolerate so much😑

      <p>I totally get you tbh the topics have been getting so weird recently a lot of ppl dont bring fun gossip like before or new convos, just recycled akgae or zb1twt talk. i guess the issue with cc is that you can reply in a thread, which means ppl just keep dragging on the same talk, rs is better you cant create threads, if someone has someone to say they can leave a comment, so u (rqfm) dont have to reply to it.</p>
