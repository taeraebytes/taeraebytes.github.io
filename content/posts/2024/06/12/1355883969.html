      <p>As someone who watched kpop from 2nd gen to now Its acc sad idols dont interact anymore esp female and male idols 
There were so many fun stories of crushes going to club together WGM etc 
I mean ofc fans didnt like it but they catered more for general public on variety anyways 
Now even weekly idol is PG💀 Im not just glorifying the past tho defo there was crazy shit but i hope that since trends come and go the youtube era of kpop contents pushed by the pandemic will slowly end and variety shows will be popular again</p>
