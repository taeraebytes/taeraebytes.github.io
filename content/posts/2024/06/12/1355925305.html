      <p>op here tbh i only rewatched bp once and thats cause i was watching with my friend, its honestly diff and you get to reflect on moments that happened that in hidsight you may understand more. but you realise these shows are biased and a lot of the segments and not creative, esp with fhe planet series</p>

      <p>My conspiracy theory has always been that they wanted Matthew to be the other center cause if they wanted to push the haobin narrative from the beginning they wouldve frames the two first episodes completely differently, they were obviously fine with hao getting center tho cause that's their golden boy but yeah I'll never forget Matthew getting the visual vote let's BFFR</p>

      <p>Love Matthew but them putting him as a shiny boy was ridiculous like if they wanted a Korean kamden would've been more believable ðŸ˜­not even his bff Hanbin even CONSIDERED him that spot should've gone to hao, Ricky, shuaibo or jinxin</p>

      <p>it's fucked up but his little beef with woonggi made some of the best drama in the show like he sucked but we had to thank shuaibo for his service bc who else was gonna look that bad on tv for our entertainment</p>

      <p>that matthew drama was so dumb he was so stupid on that show, when they were talking abt switching his part and he was like "this is a hidden cam right" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but i dont think hanbin moving jay was framed as a villain move at all especially bc no one gaf about jay at that point</p>
