      <p>not tryna burst yalls bubble or anything and happy for ricky for getting hit tweets in japan but that really doesnt mean a lot because unless you're new to kpop you would know jfans will give anything and anyone a hit tweet and sorry matthew is still a king with the other two maybe ricky and hanbin can compete for the 4th spot</p>
