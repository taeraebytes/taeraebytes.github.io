      <p>I am sorry but something that will always give me the ick about Aespa is the way they keep pushing for winrina like let it go nobody really believes that you are a thing aside of your delusional shippers. They are like jenlisa shippers but if jenlisa did fanservice. And Karina it's the worse at it too.</p>
