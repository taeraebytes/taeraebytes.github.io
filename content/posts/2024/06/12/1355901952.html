      <p>ugh no i'm sorry i hate the pointy chin so bad like in boys planet his chin was more square and it looked fine??????? so i don't get why they had to change it. now it looks like the feature doesn't fit his face he looks like a god damn dorito. they need to take whatever that is out, fix the lips and stop giving him that white foundation like he's pale but he's not THAT pale. THEN he's sorted</p>

      <p>I noticed his chin can be pointy or rounder depending on the angle so sometimes I'm like does he even have chin fillers üò≠ because even in his pre debut teen pics it was pretty pointy and in some angles it was rounder just like now. Also he naturally just has a longer lower jaw so again depending on the angle it can make his chin look longer/ pointier esp when he takes selfies from above.</p>

      <p>I can attest to queef because I stalk his sis on a daily ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è His chin is naturally pointy just like his sister & your right anon he has a longer jaw so it can make his chin look even pointy-er in some angles and I like his chin too. You can tell it's not chin filler because it's not always pointy depending on angle.

I'm telling you guys if you guys just saw his sister all your plastic surgery/ filler assumptions will be gone. Same nose, same chin, same jaw, same shoulders (I used to accuse him of wearing shoulder pads LMAO until I saw she had the same sharp shoulders) and she's only 15 I've been stalking her since last year when she still had pics of her when she was 11-14.</p>
