      <p>wow remember daeul he was almost our gyuvin.... actually now that we're talking about it half of gyuvin's issues come from the fact that he didnt get the sohye untalented but loveable edit like he would get dragged way less and his fans wouldnt be deluded about his talents if he was packaged that way off rip people love a clear dozen even of theyre troll stanning</p>

      <p>Lol the reason why a lot of us preshow stans voted for daeul was cause of his ending fairy his smiled seemed endearing ðŸ˜­we then saw the first episode. Zhang Hao and Matt had zero hype back then Matthew wasn't even pretty disliked before the payola accusations zh then got the heterophoria screen time and legitimately great live performer buff (over me is THE reason he won p01) and Matthew had the screentime, cute personality and jfans buff his jay mark cover was also really good I think it was the most memorable performance of the first episode</p>

      <p>Everything falls into place for Hao. The hype that zerohour payola made for him was crazy. People highly anticipated his performance because of the leak and the drama. This is a rare situation where I believe in destiny. Hao destined to win despite the big push that the whole production is giving hanbin. Had they not exposed for rigging before, hanbin would definitely be P01. So yeah, we watched how destiny played</p>

      <p>She slowed down in fear of people dragging Hao last year because BTS fans were coming for her when she's selling Christmas stuff. She only posted the CCMA photos because it's Hao's first award. Then stopped updating the account. But she didn't lock it for others to see his contents & because she's still a fan but she needs to earn somehow. She's a Wonbin fs too. I saw somewhere that she was spotted in one event still taking photos of Hao</p>

      <p>not really, Zero Hour literally spent 1 million won for Zh in the final, and Wonbin's fansite actually clarified she's not Zero Hour. I remember she posted it on Pann. Zero Hour is known because she has a pretty good quality camera (focused and not shaking), so it's still different from Minjii. She is a grown and rich woman, so I think she focuses on her real life now</p>
