      <p>wonyoung is just on a whole league of her own but whats stopping people fully stanning her is ive bc they are really not that interesting as a group while karina is coming for her title and have aespa to back her up which pushes her more. if aespa continues to get bigger, karina would easily surpass her</p>

      <p>I know it's over the top comparison, but look at it this way. Wonyoung is Gdragon. A brand you can put anywhere. Karina is Jaejoong. The one popular in idol world.</p>
