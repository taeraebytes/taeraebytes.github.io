      <p>I hope you share my last CC because it's insane to me how people think being anonymous is okay to be hateful but in reality it's just projection of whatever you're feeling about yourself.

Your online footprint will always be linked to you no matter how much you think you're safe and the amount of people I see being doxxed and having their online footprint sent to their employers, schools and future schools, family and friends is a lot. I get being a troll and I troll all the time and say I some shit I would never say irl but that person is literally mentally fucked up just from the extent they're willing to go through to make their page look like they're a fan. Plus the fact that they probably feel gratification when people fall for the setup and bash Ricky is literally a psychopath in the making.

It's like how serial killers start off with watching crime docs then insects then small animals then humans. So you anons reading this, it's okay to be a troll, I too troll and gossip that's why I'm here but there's a line. There's a point where it's no longer trolling and it's something mentally fucked up so get that shit fixed cause I bet this person doesn't even know they're mentally fucked up because they're lines are so skewed, I mean they've been doing this for a year now... 

My mom is a therapist and she says the amount of patients she gets regretting using social media to project their anger with themselves onto celebrities is too much. They eventually get doxed no matter if they used vpn or an unrecognizable username that has nothing to do with the irl they still got doxed and it ruined them irl.</p>

      <p>I'm not above hating and trolling like none of us are idw anyone to confuse ur point but things to this extreme are sick it's scary.. like it's gotta be some fucked up drive to get off on receiving hateful attention and pouring ur negative emotions into a random person. But this level of insanity reminds me of those barbs who went around doxxing people and then got charges pressed against them like

      <p>diff anon and this reminds me of a doc i watched about pedos and r@pist and a therapist going to their jail to interview these ppl to try to understand them and y they did the things they did and they said it wasnt about the act itself but they liked the humiliation the victims went through and it was the main reason they kept doing it. fkin physcoooooooooossssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss 

i kno this is an extreme comparison to an internet hater but i can see where it leads to iykwim like u hate someone so much (that u dont even personally know like thats the first red flag to get help) so u want other ppl to hate X so when ppl hate X ur happy but when they aren't getting the hate u want and even getting loved and more popular then u get mad and upset and it drives u insane so then u start doing more and more extreme stuff to get ppl to hate X. i can totally see this person try and start malicious rumors to get ppl to hate X and when that doesnt work and no longer satisfies them i can see them moving onto the physical world and try to hurt X in person. like there are already so many stories with akgaes doing this exact thing</p>
