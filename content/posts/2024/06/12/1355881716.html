      <p>yeah theyre pretty even right now and depends on demographic. wonyoung is really popular with girls and her fanbase is almost entirely girls, shes really popular in korea, japan and fans from ioi where karina i'd say her fanbase is pretty even between female and male fans and shes popular in korea and china and has sm stans.

but ever since wonyoung went on that show with the 3 konglish dudes (iirc this is literally her first solo schedule since ive ðŸ’€) she got mad gp virality and gained some male fans too cuz they found out she actually had a personality and not just a pretty face and they really liked it. GIVE WONY SCHEDULES NOW !</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s not even tho yall gotta pay attention WY attracts all age demographics in kr and ppl recognize her not only for her group but herself as well. Karina does not have that kind of pull yet. I will say tho she was ahead of WY in China but after sm leaked that dating stuff of her it kinda plumped her but sheâ€™s steady again rn</p>

      <p>It says right there she wanted to learn Chinese meaning she'd probably be based and frequently work in China but karinas loss was bigger than wonys
