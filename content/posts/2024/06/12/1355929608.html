      <p>ugh no i'm sorry i hate the pointy chin so bad like in boys planet his chin was more square and it looked fine??????? so i don't get why they had to change it. now it looks like the feature doesn't fit his face he looks like a god damn dorito. they need to take whatever that is out, fix the lips and stop giving him that white foundation like he's pale but he's not THAT pale. THEN he's sorted</p>

      <p>I noticed his chin can be pointy or rounder depending on the angle so sometimes I'm like does he even have chin fillers üò≠ because even in his pre debut teen pics it was pretty pointy and in some angles it was rounder just like now. Also he naturally just has a longer lower jaw so again depending on the angle it can make his chin look longer/ pointier esp when he takes selfies from above.</p>
