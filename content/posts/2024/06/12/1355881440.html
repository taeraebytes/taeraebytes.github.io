      <p>if we are being real about loona:

chuu: essential member, her vocals were one of the best and she was the star of the group on korea. gave them a lot of popularity.

yves: one of the few outstanding dancers by herself (loona dancing is good as a group but individually some members are weak). vocals were decent too.

jinsoul: she kinda annoying but she carried loona a lot when it comes to their sound, their producer knew how to utilize her voice.

hyunjin: only funny for a bit, then when you keep knowing the group for a long time the jokes stop being funny. she gives nothing in terms of talent.

gowon: she's 50/50 to me. in some songs she was needed in others it was whatever.

vivi: the definition of a filler member.

heejin: the backbone of the group she was doing a lot for the group in terms of dance vocals and visuals.

choerry: same as gowon. like tbh they give the same to the group, gowon could leave and it would be fine bc choerry was there and vice versa.

yeojin: one of the best solo songs but tbh she could also leave the group and nobody would change in terms of talent. she's very pretty tho.

Kim lip: the best solo of loona. insane vocals insane face card good dancing too.

hyeju: she's carrying loossemble. she's a crazy performer and she was also needed for that loona sound.

haseul: people kinda exaggerate her vocals but she does elevate loona vocal talent.</p>
