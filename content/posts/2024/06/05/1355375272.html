      <p>I was thinking jiwoong freaky ass would but I could see several members be into freaky shit which tbh you do you just don't be exposed and be classy, I only see Matthew and gyuvin as more reluctant and not into those stuffs and I could see hao hoe around but not be into weird sex shit he'd be into BDSM at most that's like the new canilla</p>

      <p>gyuvin and Matthew aren't on ur freak list but the rest are?? I don't think any of them are into anything crazy but the members who seem the most open minded are probably ermmm freakier ig

      <p>I don't see anyone being as classless and dirty as NCT besides jiwoong but I could see taerae, ricky and Hanbin being pretty freaky and promiscuous, I see gunwook and hao as just as much promiscuous but more boring and less adventurous and Matthew and gyuvin as pretty conservative hashtag IMO</p>
