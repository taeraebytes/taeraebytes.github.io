Why do I feel like all their songs so far are catered to Hanbin's naturally high pitch and when they go low like run run, he'll struggle while the rest sound good? I mean, they can make a song from lower register to belting. Save the other boys and don't ler them sing those falsettos again. Let them do run run run title track. They aren't girl group. ðŸ˜­",
