      <p>when tf is zbtv coming back how many months has it been lol....... content wasn't the greatest but one of the most recent anons said zb1 should have more content focused on their relationships/chemistry so they should do that for zbtv. easy. company seriously does not know how to do shit yet for the fans it's so obvious lmao, how sad</p>

      <p>Also they should drop the script and focus on team building challenges that would be fun like zb1_folder has always been miles better it's just not consistent enough

      <p>honestly I think so too they've never done this before but we'll have to see also are they going to announce the new company yet cuz why's wakeone still operating especially considering they were supposed to be the ones dissolved ???

      <p>I forget which acc put it was specifically stated that wakeone and swing were going to merge I think I fully read it and it was said wakeone would be the dissolved company. Cant rmbr what acc or what article but it wasn't from a zb1 fan acc plus we discussed the news when it dropped but essentially a new management entails the same thing just none of the company dissolving.
