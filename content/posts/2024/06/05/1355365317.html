      <p>Isnt his bro in the army? And his sis is the one in the pics with han seohee lol. His step siblings are really shameless but idt hc is different. He keeps letting them in and doesnt set boundaries . His mom and step dad also are weird for letting their kids cause so much trouble for hc.</p>
