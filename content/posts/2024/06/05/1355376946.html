      <p>They could literally just plagiarized old going seventeen episodes like every kpop self variety shows have the same concept and you can do some with very low budget too omg this is one thing I really understand like this should be a priority along with lives like even if you can't do ot9 lives because of jiwoong there should be wayyyy more constant free lives in duos and trio that one Hanbin hao Ricky jiwoong one was boring but still more fun cause you could still see them interact</p>

      <p>The fact that even bday lives are solo now like omgg we have NOTHING whenever we get any sort of good group conteng I get reminded that I do actually like the whole group and I love their chemistry but sadly it's soo rare in all the previous bgs I've stabbed the family dynamic was rightfully shoved down our throars</p>
