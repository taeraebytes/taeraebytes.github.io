      <p>is it normal for the original member companies to have so much involvement when their trainees are in a temporary survival group or is wakeone just lazy and letâ€™s them do quite a bit of the work (i remember apparently xiaotingâ€™s company organised a bday live for her) like did this happen with izone and their gigs etc ðŸ˜­ like the hanbin bada video was probably due to the l1ve since she recently joined and obv hariboz keep running is yuehua, maybe that fashion event luckyz went to months ago was due to them too and then mattwookâ€™s companies donâ€™t do shit bc theyâ€™re shit, taerae is thru wk1 but theyâ€™re shit, jiwoong entered as an independent trainee but his company is acting related and his rep is shit (but maybe his variety show was their influence idk) but IDKKKKKK IT JUST GIVES ME BAD VIBES maybe bc it reminds me of how the group is gonna end like theyâ€™re already temporary yet thereâ€™s still this feeling of division rather than a united group? and the fact that ot9 content is hard to come by and there are so many akgaes doesnâ€™t help ðŸ˜­ idk if what iâ€™m saying makes me sound a bit crazy but yeah i just wish it was simply wakeone getting them all good gigs as well as full group shit but as we all know theyâ€™re extremely incompetent</p>

      <p>Wakeone does recieve help from yh but just in terms of staff. wakeone has a parent company (CJ) that's connected to almost everything so gigs aren't hard to come by in that sense. Things that are obviously organized by their original companies like hanbin and badas video hariboz cn schedules are just that and idt it's a big deal. But I think most stuff is last effort kinda things like if xiaotings company didn't organize smth for her no one would have so it's more staff power for necessity than anything it doesn't rlly bother me. And we'll obviously see less besides organized schedules now that there's a new abundance of staff from the merger. I hope this made sense
