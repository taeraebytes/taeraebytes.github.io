      <p>the period right after comeback is usually the most annoying and insufferable when solo jobs start rolling out and the fandom starts getting bored especially if there's not enough interesting content i'm already scared</p>

      <p>when tf is zbtv coming back how many months has it been lol....... content wasn't the greatest but one of the most recent anons said zb1 should have more content focused on their relationships/chemistry so they should do that for zbtv. easy. company seriously does not know how to do shit yet for the fans it's so obvious lmao, how sad</p>

      <p>They could literally just plagiarized old going seventeen episodes like every kpop self variety shows have the same concept and you can do some with very low budget too omg this is one thing I really understand like this should be a priority along with lives like even if you can't do ot9 lives because of jiwoong there should be wayyyy more constant free lives in duos and trio that one Hanbin hao Ricky jiwoong one was boring but still more fun cause you could still see them interact</p>
