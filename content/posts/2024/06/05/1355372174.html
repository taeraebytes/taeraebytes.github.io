      <p>Tyla is not that charismatic.. she's pretty and has a chill type personality but. Blk girls in the industry are wanted to be hella outspoken and loud. If you're more on the chill side like tinashe or normani you wont make it. Theres exceptions like sza but i think she is funded by the devil so</p>

      <p>rap girls have always had a focus for the past decade so it makes but normani had a chance to be big BUT SHES FUCKING STUPID and well there's doja too. It's rlly just that she lacks charisma and the connection with the internet plus her releases and appearances aren't constant enough but yea sza is in kabooms with the devil

      <p>I honestly think tyla has it to bounce back tho she's genuinely gorgeous and a better and more stable singer than Rihanna to whom she's often compared to while also being a great dancer, she has it girl energy imo</p>

      <p>if she's promoted right but also musicians are losing their touch on the public compared to actors. In general celebs have lost their touch so it's just an unlucky spot for her to be in she should focus on building an intl spotlight
