      <p>I am sorry but until some point you can't pinpoint everything on the fans. If those dudes don't care why would you? They keep saying things to make those fujos gravitate towards them. You have some fan telling Zhanghao that him and Hanbin are dating to his own face and the man it's like Yeah yeah we are love at first sight and shit like that. Then you have Matthew who keeps being like Omg Gunwook is mine!!! To any fan. Don't even get me started on all the shit Gyuvin said about Ricky.

If they wanted to change their image they would've stop by now and the fanservice excuse doesn't even work bc kfans don't even fuck with shippers like that so if Hao stood up and told some fan like omg we are not dating, nobody would even care or come for him.</p>
