      <p>This is the result of singing in their range. Why do I feel like all their songs so far are catered to Hanbin's naturally high pitch and when they go low like run run, he'll struggle while the rest sound good? I mean, they can make a song from lower register to belting. Save the other boys and don't ler them sing those falsettos again. Let them do run run run title track. They aren't girl group. ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>people keep saying this and have no idea what they're talking about because the notes that they sing in run run cover are all mostly in the 4th octave which is NOT the lower register for a man it's their normal talking range and both taerae and hao have a developed lower register but they also have a developed upper register they can both (NICELY not barely) belt upto G4 consistently and have even done G#4 and A4s sometimes and hanbin and gunwook and matthew are pretty good with their falsettos and head voice (ricky too most times ðŸ˜…) what you people really want is for the members who are not that good to sing the "normal talky" parts.. limiting the other members who are actual good decent vocalists will stagnate their growth and is honestly insulting them if they're being asked to sing in ranges that other bgs who cannot hold a note do as well</p>

      <p>ouuu watch ur mouth I don't rlly care ab the ost cover I was gonna add more to previous cc but I was just lazy. I still think the range of the cover was more comfortable for the whole group and it was a good performance. but songs like in bloom are seriously too high imo I didn't totally enjoy hearing anyone sing it besides hao it didn't feel comfortable and I don't want smth like that again like seriously that song sounded like it was meant for girl group. I think music with lower ranges is tea and it doesn't always have to be flat or boring and like we can't act like this isn't top 3 complaints when it comes to their music like everyone is good off that
