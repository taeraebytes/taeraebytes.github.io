      <p>Tbh I don't know how this kinda thing blows up because there's no proof other than 'trust me bro' because the pics are vague af and it could be sasaengs staying at the same hotel but because they're staying at the same hotel they can say anything and people will jump on it. I think that's why it's not really making noise on the kside</p>
