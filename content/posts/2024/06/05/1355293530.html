Things that are obviously organized by their original companies like hanbin and badas video hariboz cn schedules are just that and idt it's a big deal. But I think most stuff is last effort kinda things like if xiaotings company didn't organize smth for her no one would have so it's more staff power for necessity than anything it doesn't rlly bother me. And we'll obviously see less besides organized schedules now that there's a new abundance of staff from the merger. I hope this made sense"
