      <p>when tf is zbtv coming back how many months has it been lol....... content wasn't the greatest but one of the most recent anons said zb1 should have more content focused on their relationships/chemistry so they should do that for zbtv. easy. company seriously does not know how to do shit yet for the fans it's so obvious lmao, how sad</p>
