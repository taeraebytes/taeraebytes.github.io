      <p>the period right after comeback is usually the most annoying and insufferable when solo jobs start rolling out and the fandom starts getting bored especially if there's not enough interesting content i'm already scared</p>

      <p>when tf is zbtv coming back how many months has it been lol....... content wasn't the greatest but one of the most recent anons said zb1 should have more content focused on their relationships/chemistry so they should do that for zbtv. easy. company seriously does not know how to do shit yet for the fans it's so obvious lmao, how sad</p>

      <p>Also they should drop the script and focus on team building challenges that would be fun like zb1_folder has always been miles better it's just not consistent enough
