      <p>I am sorry but until some point you can't pinpoint everything on the fans. If those dudes don't care why would you? They keep saying things to make those fujos gravitate towards them. You have some fan telling Zhanghao that him and Hanbin are dating to his own face and the man it's like Yeah yeah we are love at first sight and shit like that. Then you have Matthew who keeps being like Omg Gunwook is mine!!! To any fan. Don't even get me started on all the shit Gyuvin said about Ricky.

If they wanted to change their image they would've stop by now and the fanservice excuse doesn't even work bc kfans don't even fuck with shippers like that so if Hao stood up and told some fan like omg we are not dating, nobody would even care or come for him.</p>

      <p>We know they know what they're doing it's appeasing fans but 1 that's business and just kpop 2 there would be backlash for constantly dodging or shutting down

      <p>I'm not talking about you but op and yes but you can shut down in easy way which zh has done, he does tooo much sometimes and completely feeds into it even outside of fs, they're both adults so they're free to do what they want and I get why they pander to that fanbase specifically considering their solo fan bases are genuinely terrible but I can't help but roll my eyes when their akgaes think their innocent victims, the way hao acted when rosins and zc were fighting on plus chat proved that he's 100% aware</p>

      <p>Yea he's aware but it's not like either hao or hanbin have sworn allegiance to their akgaes or shippers like they don't even say anything too crazy in terms of kpop fans and they're constantly being imposed on im not gonna really put responsibility on them for how stupid zeroses are when it comes to shipping/boundaries/sexuality

      <p>anon you dont know how hard it is to constantly please your own solo stans and shippers at the same time esp when they are not in good terms and zh gets subjected to that more because he's the one fluent in chinese where most of their crazy ass shippers come from like its their job to please these people and fans interpretation of what they say is not mostly their fault</p>

      <p>I'm not a shipper or a zh fan and I won't blame him for what he does but he was liking comments of people with the names binhao get married and when there were fanwars was purposely interacting with shippers, no one forced him to do that, he's clearly marketing it himself too and nothing wrong with that but you gotta admit it's also his own doing..</p>

      <p>Yes yes I definitely agree and I think some people should be banned from fc I'm just saying literally no one asked him to do some of this stuff and he's a willing participant at this point which again, absolutely nothing wrong with Hanbin, Gunwook, Matthew, Gyuvin and Ricky are too it's not an accusation I'm just trying to be real</p>

Any normal fans know zb1 completely willingly operate on yaoi fanservice which is not a bad idea considering riize and bnd have 0 chemistry but falls flat considering we have 0 group content or content about their relationships, I do agree it's one of their best selling point the execution is just poor considering there's so little focus on relationships in their actual content</p>
