      <p>Taerae just gives angry vibes lol even though we've never seen it really he looks like he explodes in anger and he does look like the jealous type
Hao looks like he gets suddenly angry and annoyed and then calms down and is happy again lol he doesn't give envious tho he legitimately seem confident 
Hanbin also looks like he gets annoyed and confrontational easily but maybe mostly at Hao (not a bad thing)
I think the rest are chill</p>
