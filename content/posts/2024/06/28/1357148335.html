      <p>I have no clue tbh Ollie's been so separated from the other yuehuaz and he was sent back to china immediately after getting eliminated and pushed into cent I saw yuehua do some new years calendar with their Chinese artists and he was there too I feel like they won't especially if they decided to put hao in the group Ollie will be their Chinese cash cow instead. He's in a temporary survival show group as their center rn anyways

      <p>im pretty sure hes already signed under an artist contract in yuehua china since before he went on that chinese survival so theres like no way he would debut in korea and his group is supposedly permanent but that doesnt mean much in cpop the group will probably go inactive in like 3 years max</p>

      <p>ages ago i saw that apparently they added lots of new members who didn't even win the survival show and the pic of the whole group looked like nct like imagine if zb1 doubled in members from ppl outside the top 9 then what's the point of the survival show LMAO</p>

      <p>If anyone wants the tea on this it's cause there were some trainees from hong kong who made it who didn't want to go to the main land for performances cause of some schedule conflict (???) and since 90% of the debut group members were yuehua trainees yuehua took over management and added in some of the other yuehua trainees who were in the finale to make up for it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ side note yuehua runs shit like crazy in China they're like SM there 10/18 ppl were from yuehua in the finale 

As for ollie most of the ppl who made it in the Asia super young group have their own group and other shit going on and he's kind of on kingly status there rn and since it's managed by yuehua they'll make sure they're done by 2026 anyways so I would say they will add him in the new group if there's one</p>

      <p>I wouldn't say they got lucky the whole show was set in a way that favors yuehua in every aspect the whole pool had like 20 trainees from that company (they even sent in a WHOLE already debuted group) and even 2/5 judges were from also from yuehua and one of the trainees was even in a group with the LITERAL JUDGE ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
