      <p>I have no clue tbh Ollie's been so separated from the other yuehuaz and he was sent back to china immediately after getting eliminated and pushed into cent I saw yuehua do some new years calendar with their Chinese artists and he was there too I feel like they won't especially if they decided to put hao in the group Ollie will be their Chinese cash cow instead. He's in a temporary survival show group as their center rn anyways

      <p>im pretty sure hes already signed under an artist contract in yuehua china since before he went on that chinese survival so theres like no way he would debut in korea and his group is supposedly permanent but that doesnt mean much in cpop the group will probably go inactive in like 3 years max</p>
