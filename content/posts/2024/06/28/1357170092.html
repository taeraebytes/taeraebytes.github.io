      <p>I saw sohee & wonbin doubling for sungchan at his first part & anton & maybe eunseok doubling for his his line so l'm pretty sure they took the criticism & tried to perfect all the notes</p>

      <p>I can imagine Soyeon's disgust whenever she's recording. Soyeon doesn't even like Miyeon's voice that much, how much more Shuhua's. Soyeon only likes Minnie's dreamy voice and Yuqi's low register. She hates how generic Miyeon's voice sounds. But if Miyeon isn't pretty, people would be gagging over his voice. It's hard for Kpop fans to accept that pretty people can be main vocals too.</p>

      <p>Ow, I don't particularly like her voice. The YG style kills me. But she's a vocalist. I don't understand why people don't talk much about her vocals when she's one of the strongest in 4th gen. She's better than all of the aespa, ive, new jeans and Lesserafim members.</p>
