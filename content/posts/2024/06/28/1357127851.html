      <p>omg sorry I have to fact check cuz theyâ€™ve been driving me nuts about the lmj stuff but they literally did retweet they just didnâ€™t retweet the post weeks later about it hitting a million views which whatever. some rosin decided to lie that they didnâ€™t share ANYTHING and everyone ran with it cuz no one knows how to look up stuff for themselves</p>
