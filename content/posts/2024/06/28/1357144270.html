      <p>this is such a stupid correlation what does having a 22k likes on a tweet have to do with buying albumskcjsla and yeah i think it's a culture difference because the things that are funny to most kfans (or jfans) are just ? to most ifans</p>

      <p>not sure ðŸ˜­ but yea it's a cultural difference i guess and also humor has never been a strong suit so it's cringe to me

      <p>The correlation is that jfans liked that so basically keep them entertained so they don't leave and keep buying those albums. That's what I meant, I am not saying that now they will get 22K albums just bc of the likes</p>
