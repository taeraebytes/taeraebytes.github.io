      <p>ur mad bcs i assumed you get to choose ur president ???? As far as i know the us is a federal republic does that not means that the people do actually pick the president through an election where each state picks their electors based on the popular vote and then these electors cast their votes in the electoral college to decide the president?? or am i wrong???</p>

      <p>Like I said before the country is ran by white old heads the media misconstrues what the public looks like minorities are at a disadvantage here so we have no choice in the matter and redlining districts actually makes the electoral vote unfair it's not population based it's geographical it's just an insane thing to ask why we would put Biden and trump up LIKE WE GOT A CHOICEðŸ˜‘
