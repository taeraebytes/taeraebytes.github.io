      <p>Idek why we in it cause there were only a handful of zerose talking about their corny jebekarma bs and 99% of the qrts on that tweet are from hybe fans or kpop fans in general 😑 and I agree with them if it was a girl group or just any non SM group they would be done</p>

      <p>Yea if anything most zeroses ignore because they're so dead set on keeping "peace" and they won't even defend zb1 when they get dragged like that's all a load of BULLSHIT😭😭😭 like please leave us alone and get the hybe fans and just seeing the scale of hate zb1 got for their ftp encore which was better compared to their yesterdays encore is enough like they're never getting hate like that fr fr they'll be aight
