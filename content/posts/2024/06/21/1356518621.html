      <p>Who in zb1 would cheat based on a very quick look through their chart absolutely not in depth since no birth times
Jiwoong: yes and will gaslight tf out of you, could still get into a serious relationship and express regret but would still do it yes
Hao: ehh not necessarily might need a lot of attention though so if flirting around is cheating then yes, if he does it's not for fun though it's self sabotage or emotional unfulfillment 
Hanbin: yeah def he's a Gemini stellium w a pisces moon and sag mars but he can def commit and blove his partner deeply but yeah
Matthew: there's a possibility ofc but no I don't think so similarly to hao if he did it'd be very heavy emotionally and self sabotage 
Ricky: oh yeah he's cheating down but maybe regretting it afterwards and really reflecting if he gets into a good one but yeah no
Gyuvin: probably not if he did probably intoxicated and would regret it a lot 
Gunwook: yeah but could also seriously commit kinda like hanbin
Yujin: yeah and would gaslight down too but could also comit strongly kinda like Hanbin again</p>
