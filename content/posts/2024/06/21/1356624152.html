      <p>I saw a Rosin post about the album cover stocks in Japan. Order slip according to the best-selling members who had their stocks sold out first
135892
Hao, Matthew, Gunwook, Jiwoong, Yujin, Hanbin. Other members still have stocks.
So, the 3 princes of Japan are still alright. This is also a proof that Ricky's Twitter clicks are just Hanbin's Instiz and Naver clicks. They don't translate to sales.</p>
