      <p>Okay so what i know is they are very big on talented groups like sea is the second home for yg groups, they love the big4 like 80% of fans there will stan the big4 esp in indo, being chaotic/having a lot of variety content. everything else is just down to promoting well over there with concerts and luck, theres some groups huge in america or west like ateez p1h that just dont have a large sea fandom at all. ricky is wellknown in my country, jiwoong kind of for the bl but nobody else. unless it comes to shipping where theres a whole diff world and suddenly yujin gyuvin have a huge fandom</p>
