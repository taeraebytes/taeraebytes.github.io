      <p>Have you guys heard of Chinese birth charts? I don't know what the Chinese version is called tbh so I'm just calling it that but there's a textbook full of dates and depending on your zodiac i think specific days are good luck and bad luck and times too they use it for special occasions I think and usually u go to monk or something

I went to a Chinese friends funeral and they had to do it on a specific day and bury at a certain time and same can be said when giving birth like there are days you cannot give birth or else you'll have bad luck and if it clashes with your parents zodiac or something oh and also for the funeral if your zodiac clashes with the deceased u have to do certain things like not look when theyre being buried or else bad luck its kinda cool</p>
