      <p>HFJDJNDNFJFKFKIDJDJXD yea I don't think he should be exposing anything if he's not 100% if they're a sasaeng or not he's actually crashing out before our eyes

      <p>Yeah but imagine you get followed and called everywhere constantly you'd be crashing out too reminds me of Avril Lavigne and willow smith saying they get paranoia and hear paparazzi when they're alone or sleeping</p>

      <p>Most of them do not and that's a terrible way to view any issue, they should expect the huge responsibility and burden that comes with being an idol and a certain loss of privacy and parasocialism but not actual constant stalking that's fucked up even if it comes with the job</p>
