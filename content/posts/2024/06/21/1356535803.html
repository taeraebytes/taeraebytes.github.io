      <p>casually keeping tabs on iland2 because the gg will be under wakeone and that affects zb1. The show is flopping bad but the gg does have potential because the visuals are good and they do have the grace of being permanent so it’s okay if they don’t hit daebak right off the bat. My biggest takeaway from following it is that Mnet seems so have learned their lesson from kep1er. Kep1er’s biggest downfall has always been their lack of visual appeal which made it hard for them to gain new fans and even made lose fans once the hype died down.</p>

      <p>keplers downfall was that the lineup was shit and nobody liked it cuz the system was so stupid if they have a good lineup enough visuals and average talent they'll be fine if they're focused on but I don't think they will be while zb1 are active. They have the gg advantage tho
