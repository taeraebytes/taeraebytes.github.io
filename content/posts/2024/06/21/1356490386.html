      <p>ok jiwoong I hated immediately and I still hate him. I hated him cuz I was a seunghwan fan and he was the main vocal of the audition BUT THIS UGLY WHACK GUY WAS GETTINF ALL THE SCREENTIME AND HE CANT DANCE OR SING AND HE DID BAIT W CHOPPED JONGWOOOO UGHHHHðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I didn't even notice taerae and well not much has changed

I actually rlly liked hanbin a lot I was like shit this might be the next KD and I mean uhmmmm we beef 3 times a week now 

I liked Matthew immediately and I thought he was so cute and even tho shit got rocky I still think that 

I thought hao was cool plus I could tell he was talented and I still think that he gave me leader vibes at first

Sorry Ricky looked like a villain and he barely spoke but I thought he was cute in a cringe way from his boss baby video but I liked his face he had more of a rugged look back then I miss itðŸ’” now he's still the same but just so miskeen I always thought he would be the funny type too and he is just in a quieter way 

Gyuvin was immediately an enemy when he covered reveal and butchered it then we bee and cool around love me right then I forgot ab him till love killa then I had to hate him on again and the beef only got worse then I forgave him again but were cool now like he gets same age immunity from me

I didn't have a single opinion ab yujin from beginning to end of bp but he's one of my favorites now 

and gunwook omg I thought his eyebrows were so nice plus his stage was good I was wondering why jellyfish sent him w a terrible trainee crop but I just thought he was talented and now he's my king for life and i want to give him everything ever ðŸ©·

      <p>Hao I didn't think he was cute actually ears too big  and I was like damn you're a gay leo southerner why are you boring af pretty skilled tho now I think he's cute and fun and I respect him a lot as an idol and as a person, probably the most in the group, he comes across as mature honest and passionate although I do get annoyed by his quick temper sometimes lol

I thought Hanbin was boring like many and I was kinda annoyed at him kinda censoring and ignoring his wacking past and not even mentioning voguing although I do obviously understand why he did so and how it's not comparable to jiwoongs bl, he used to annoy me because I think visible insecurity is one of the worst flaw a performer can have but I can see his growth and I do believe he's genuinely a good person, I feel very empathetic towards him and I hope he frees himself a bit more cause I don't think he's not genuine but the stick in his ass makes him come across like that sometimes 

Matthew ok I'm gonna be shorter now I liked then and I liked now although I had a vague hater arc during say my name cause he was being annoying 

Taerae no opinion then now I like he kinda has that fatal visible insecurity flaw I mentioned earlier  but he seems very intelligent and I like his smile and humour 

Ricky: thought he was cringe w the boss baby thing then absolutely fell in love during his first fan ads and I never looked back..I find his laugh and voice so cute and I love his more relaxed humourous side we didn't get to see

Gyuvin annoyed me cause I didn't know why he was top 9 all the time then he won me over with his final speech I actually teared up w him lol there were periods where he rllyy annoyed me but he's like family now my love for him is permanent hes too endearing my liking towards him isn</p>
