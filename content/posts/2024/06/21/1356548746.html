      <p>kinda pointless comparison because the members with the least amount are so obviously because theirs opened end of 2023 start of 2024 whereas for others these accounts opened during boys planet (peak season) for example jiwoongâ€™s og fanclub has 4.5, taeraeâ€™s 4k and Matthewâ€™s 5.4k and some are actually still active I think only taeraeâ€™s closed completely</p>
