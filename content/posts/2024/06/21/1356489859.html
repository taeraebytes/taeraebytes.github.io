      <p>ok jiwoong I hated immediately and I still hate him. I hated him cuz I was a seunghwan fan and he was the main vocal of the audition BUT THIS UGLY WHACK GUY WAS GETTINF ALL THE SCREENTIME AND HE CANT DANCE OR SING AND HE DID BAIT W CHOPPED JONGWOOOO UGHHHHðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I didn't even notice taerae and well not much has changed

I actually rlly liked hanbin a lot I was like shit this might be the next KD and I mean uhmmmm we beef 3 times a week now 

I liked Matthew immediately and I thought he was so cute and even tho shit got rocky I still think that 

I thought hao was cool plus I could tell he was talented and I still think that he gave me leader vibes at first

Sorry Ricky looked like a villain and he barely spoke but I thought he was cute in a cringe way from his boss baby video but I liked his face he had more of a rugged look back then I miss itðŸ’” now he's still the same but just so miskeen I always thought he would be the funny type too and he is just in a quieter way 

Gyuvin was immediately an enemy when he covered reveal and butchered it then we bee and cool around love me right then I forgot ab him till love killa then I had to hate him on again and the beef only got worse then I forgave him again but were cool now like he gets same age immunity from me

I didn't have a single opinion ab yujin from beginning to end of bp but he's one of my favorites now 

and gunwook omg I thought his eyebrows were so nice plus his stage was good I was wondering why jellyfish sent him w a terrible trainee crop but I just thought he was talented and now he's my king for life and i want to give him everything ever ðŸ©·
