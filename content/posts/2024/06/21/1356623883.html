      <p>what is with the weird narrative that matthew was the only one with a massive hate train on boys planet… if i stalked all their accounts enough im sure id find plenty of gunwook shade but u dont see me still going about it that was a different time and everyone was desperate for their guys to debut we’ve forgiven and forgotten and we’ve moved on bffs</p>

      <p>not to start hate train olympic but matt got a whole truck sent against him, a malicious post about him gaining 4mil views, his family got death threats, he even got hated for smiling too much at pajama party, it worse in kforums and Weibo his co had to step up to protect him even mnet came out to clarify things I'm surprised most seokryus are ot9s but yeah the witch hunt is annoying to me too</p>
