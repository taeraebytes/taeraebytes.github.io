      <p>no one was expecting any renewal for kep1er and look what happened, yuehuaz have the most possible planned future after disbandment so if they're renewing (i think they are) it will def be without them, it will impact the group negatively especially without zhang hao for sure but i think the remaining members will agree to continue to ride the little fame zb1 name has to offer and i dont blame them if they do</p>

      <p>the group will collapse and it's evident to anyone that's the case there's not gonna be renewal with 5 members of the group and one of those 5 BEING JIWOONG so let's say 4 members hanbin will definitely get pulled next is taerae and gunwook and obviously mnh will pull too like there is only a possibility if yh agrees
