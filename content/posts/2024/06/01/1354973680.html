    "question": "she didn't win \"her case\". her getting fired is a matter of time. what she won was a case against her removal as a ceo, she stays as a co-ceo for now. the reason why court sided with her here is because even tho hybe has all the evidence of her planning to take over ador and conspiring behind the scenes, legally going against the parent company is not considered to be a good reason to fire her. she could only be fired if she tried take down ador, not hybe. the judge even said that the hybe has all the evidence but in this case they can't be used and to prepare them for the criminal court. she's about to be absolute cooked. kpop stans don't realize that this is literally the worst case scenario for her. if she would have let herself get fired now, she might've left with some money and somehow made newjeans to file for termination of their contracts and ran away with them. but now she's stuck as a co-ceo of ador with no administrative power and all of her allies fired. she can't even terminate newjeans contract to get them out (which was her initial escape plan in case cutting away ador from hybe wouldn't work). she's puppet ceo until she goes to a criminal court. then it's either jail or complete bankruptcy to the last penny. she knows how to play the public well, and that's what made people side with her so far, but in court it won't matter if bang pd didn't greet newjeans in the elevator or that he said to crush aespa, what will matter is the the paper trail she left of multiple white collar crimes like insider trading ðŸ’€",
