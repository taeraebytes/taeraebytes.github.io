      <p>I mean in the translation it says it's just a term of endearment used for young girls that he likes it's pretty on par with how kpop fans talk to male idols but only a zerose would say he likes she/her pronouns ðŸ˜­

      <p>Iâ€™m so confused by that post cause I am still unsure what rinini has to do with it and how rinini is a girl etc also some say it implies they/them actually and is used when someone is not sure of oneâ€™s gender because Chinese does not have genders like English</p>
