      <p>they already lack resources and are severely understaffed, now there's another permanent gg on the way ugh... like i hope the merger thing goes well. I think yeshiro leaving is a refreshing change for kep1er but wakeone isn't going to change anything concept or music wise. iland2 is a complete flop both domestically and internationally making absolutely zero noise like RUNEXT but illit at least had the hybe payola to help them this new girl group is toast unless a miracle happens.</p>

      <p>like severelyüò≠üò≠üò≠ wakeone are not even barely handling zb1 I pray this company merger does something bro. I think we can safely say that zb1 being the priority won't change we're fine

      <p>i have a feeling whilst zb1 are on tour the merger will happen and be implemented as a new companyü§û before the next cb. but i do think they for now will prioritise thst new gg debut snd promoting kepler first album before zb1 cb</p>

      <p>If they don't comeback before the tour starts, I fear they will drop a tier in popularity since ftp didn't even do good</p>
