      <p>I have the feeling that with the way they keep posting pics about concept picture clues, the real tea is that they find the Pinterest of stylist/creative directors and they leak their shit from there. That creative director that did illit concept has their profile public since a long time ago and they have entire boards about concepts ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>i can't find it anymore but if you wanted to check bc of the NewJeans x illit issue, she didn't have pins of anything related to newjeans. Most of her pins are enhypen and illit pics since she works with them, she did have mood boards but none of them had newjeans on it.</p>
