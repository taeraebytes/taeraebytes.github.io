      <p>because buying followers makes no sense and has no value when you don't have the stats and sales to back it up, their buying power is miles above everyone else and they are bigger in numbers so it's not like they have anything to prove to anyone ðŸ˜­  yujin has 200k now and his magazine sales are less than 10% of hao's in 24h lmao</p>
