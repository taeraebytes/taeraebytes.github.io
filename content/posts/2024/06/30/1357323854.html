      <p>The rise of Yaoi shit in Kpop lately is making me sick. Even Kwill is capitalizing on it. But the moment an idol becomes gay, they will drag him to hell. Every boy group is encouraged by the company to do queerbaiting and it's so disrespectful to the queer community because they're suffering because of this label but these companies is using it to sell delusions which translate into album and merch sales. I don't know when it started, more likely BTS, but Haobin made it mainstream.</p>

      <p>i feel like a kinship in kpop has always been a thing and a big part of it but ppl just take it and run and call it yaoi (which is fine as long as it‚Äôs not invasive and you know it‚Äôs all jokes) and it‚Äôs not bg specific either. i think the ‚Äúrise of yaoi‚Äù is more of the rise of ppl not knowing where their boundaries are</p>

      <p>I think in recent years it's been more about alienating and separating shippers from the general experience before light shipping and such would fly no issues but like anon said or whoever said it the vilification brought along a magnifying effect so that's probably why it seems like it's big now or it's a thing now but trust it's been a thing and companies have been exploiting it
