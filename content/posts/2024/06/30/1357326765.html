      <p>diff anon but there was a post on instiz a while ago about how the artist company has to pay for everything including the backup dancers and it's like really expensive which partially explains why very few idols went on there, it also sparked a lot of controversy between fandoms over who gets selected to be on there (the companies sending whoever they like) and people speculated that's one of the reasons they discontinued the series despite it being popular at the time, that's what kfans were saying so their words not mine</p>
