      <p>Gyuvin is okay with being the female counterpart in the ship. As long as Ricky is okay with doing yaoi service with him he can accept being the female.</p>

      <p>To me they sound like a typical gyuvin solo stan/ algae, anti gyubrik and want to push the agenda that rickys the one initiating shipping stuff and not gyuvin but everyone knows its gyuvin but they don't want to accept it and trying to blame ricky or something</p>
