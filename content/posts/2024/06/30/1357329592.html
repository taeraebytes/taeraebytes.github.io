      <p>The rise of Yaoi shit in Kpop lately is making me sick. Even Kwill is capitalizing on it. But the moment an idol becomes gay, they will drag him to hell. Every boy group is encouraged by the company to do queerbaiting and it's so disrespectful to the queer community because they're suffering because of this label but these companies is using it to sell delusions which translate into album and merch sales. I don't know when it started, more likely BTS, but Haobin made it mainstream.</p>

      <p>i feel like a kinship in kpop has always been a thing and a big part of it but ppl just take it and run and call it yaoi (which is fine as long as it‚Äôs not invasive and you know it‚Äôs all jokes) and it‚Äôs not bg specific either. i think the ‚Äúrise of yaoi‚Äù is more of the rise of ppl not knowing where their boundaries are</p>

      <p>I think in recent years it's been more about alienating and separating shippers from the general experience before light shipping and such would fly no issues but like anon said or whoever said it the vilification brought along a magnifying effect so that's probably why it seems like it's big now or it's a thing now but trust it's been a thing and companies have been exploiting it

      <p>This has impacted zb1 so much actually especially since we have a huge akgae fanbase now you have one half rpstwt who in their corner who do document interactions but with censoring and obviously romantic and nsfw tweets in their accs and one half akgaes who actively censor and hate on other members we are lacking normal "family" accs BTS , svt would be nowhere without their aggressively family no solos attitude</p>

      <p>People run off big accs like i remember the thread on bubblebaseone while yes they probably lack translators but they were still providing us all the content in one place and their interactions were so good. Now look we don‚Äôt even have a big acc for Mnet plus chats and I feel so lost tbh. Please recommend some good ot9 Mnet+ acc.</p>

      <p>they were irresponsible and needed better translators but god were they the best unifying acc and with over 100k followers like it's imperative to have a central and active ot9 page

      <p>I would love it if I could help recruit people for you but probably not the best place to startüò≠ I'm sure there are a couple anons that would because it really is so important to have a unifying acc

      <p>It cannot be that hard we just need someone with all 9 chats and I'm sure there's plenty of people that speak korean and chinese the translations doesn't even have to be super on time bubblebaseone used to be late all the time</p>

      <p>don't say that it is probably really hard to run a group translation acc you'd need a bunch of translators I think one person having the chats is too much so it should be split and people who can promise some kind of on spot activity especially starting out the acct should try to be on time because there's already established solo pluschat translators

      <p>Oh no one person can‚Äôt do it, do you know how many texts zb1 sends in a day üò≠ and then they  use korean, Chinese sometimes even Japanese - they also use specific nuances in Chinese and Korean. Other than that being on time is the first thing and one person can‚Äôt update everything real time, you would atleast need 3-4 people who would update in diff time zones. It‚Äôs a lot more work than one would assume, if one person will do this then they‚Äôll get tired really fast.</p>
