      <p>Actually gyuvin didn't leave hanbin at all. He still wears their couple necklace while hanbin wearing the ring that gyuvin gave him as a gift. And they still near to eo like in the airport and in their car. Because I feel like gyuvin is really genuine to hanbin. And maybe theres a reason behind about members interaction depends in the place that they will perform or go.</p>
