      <p>Have you seen the intl conspiracies with ftp? They saying Sweat was supposed to be the tt but then fuckass max came by and stupid ass wakeone thought he was some kind of higher being white dude that'll bless us with chart results so wakeone decided to switch last minute and make ftp the tt instead hence why the members during comeback prep season were saying things like they don't know whats going on etc.</p>

      <p>nah ftp was the intended tt I feel like the songs were completely recorded by Jan they filmed sweat first in a much simpler manner in the beginning of March then ftp recording came later. The members also talked a lot about how they fought for sweat to be a prerelease not to mention intl fans aren't rmbring or just understand the actual massacre that was sweat no way a song with jiwoong in the top 3 most lines and one of the main vocalist and the center in the bottom 3 ever gonna be a ttðŸ˜­....
