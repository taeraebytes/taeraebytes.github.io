      <p>it’s really interesting because she’s doing all the moves correctly but she’s adding no groove, hardly any energy, and no facial expressions which makes it look kinda flat and lifeless 😭 i feel like that’s how sm trains them to dance tho cuz that’s how the rest of the group dances too, super precise but no musicality</p>

      <p>Idk dance terminology but it seems like she never fully completes the moves or the energy isn't right like why does it look muddled idk the lack of presence is crazy
