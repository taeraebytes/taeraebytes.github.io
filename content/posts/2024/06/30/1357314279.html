      <p>No exactly these people actively running off his fans turn around and cry about people not fundraising for him or not streaming hard enough as if they arent gonna jump you for calling him hot or insinuating he knows what sex is on any random tuesday. Trust it's not high schoolers raising money and organizing fan support for these idols it never has been and suddenly its a problem just for gw 😮‍💨. I actually cant stand this level of infantilizing that literally wouldnt be happening if he were born two weeks earlier. Why do I feel like I rarely see public i-fan accounts age 19-23 for him anymore when that's LITERALLY HIS OWN AGE DEMO have they all gone priv?? (I dont even blame them I did too but i need stats on this)</p>
