      <p>No exactly these people actively running off his fans turn around and cry about people not fundraising for him or not streaming hard enough as if they arent gonna jump you for calling him hot or insinuating he knows what sex is on any random tuesday. Trust it's not high schoolers raising money and organizing fan support for these idols it never has been and suddenly its a problem just for gw üòÆ‚Äçüí®. I actually cant stand this level of infantilizing that literally wouldnt be happening if he were born two weeks earlier. Why do I feel like I rarely see public i-fan accounts age 19-23 for him anymore when that's LITERALLY HIS OWN AGE DEMO have they all gone priv?? (I dont even blame them I did too but i need stats on this)</p>

      <p>YOU REALLY DONT üò≠ like im lucky to have been a bp gpd otherwise had I become a fan later on I'd be force to kick it with highschoolers on public twt it makes no sense to me and im seeing such off script accusatory paragraphs about how people have been waiting to prey on gunwook over that one troll rps tweet like üòü these people have lost the plot and their minds and yes unfortunately most of the lit fun older gpds have gone priv we wuz being crucified

      <p>The funniest part is like... has even even once expressed discomfort over his fans ""sexualizing"" him since becoming a legal adult on korean soil?? like what does that even mean anyway the bar keeps shifting everyday. why do these children think he wants them to stop his bag by "protecting" him? they will look at a fansite pic of his stomach from a public fansign where 100 pictures are taken every second and be like omg he didnt know that pic was taken poor innont baby üòî like he wasnt wearing a fucking furry dog tail LMAO that level of naivety would not be normal at his age and IS NOT normal in general.</p>

      <p>Ok ngl even if he did feel a certain way I doubt he's gonna voice it out but I think majority of the fans who feel this way don't give gunwook credit for being aware like it is part of the job to be fanservicey in that way I thought the reaction to the stomach pics was funny it was like so Victorian it's a stomach... and I don't think it was a big deal or that violating he just lifted his shirt a bit and cmon he's about to be shirtless on tour in a year AND THE CRAZIEST PART OF IT ALLüò≠ was the people who had his pluschat shirtless selfie in their icons getting upset like this cant be right. I could respect the stance more if it was consistent but it's just not

      <p>i feel like if he was that precious about being seen in any state of undress he would have gone behind the curtain to change because that's what you do... you don't lift your shirt up in front of people with cameras then get shocked when a picture was taken</p>
