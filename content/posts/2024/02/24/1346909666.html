      <p>I don't give a shit about brand deals or so but Wakeone needs to accept solo brand deals now like. They're the only ones who hasn't got one yet 😭😭

      <p>I feel like they weren’t accepting them before to try and keep thing fair in the earlier days. Idk if anyone really talks about this anymore but it’s so clear dazed was supposed to be a haobin only thing and that’s the reasons only those two got solo covers or arena homme only supposed to be hao. But seeing how hao did a solo shoot and now Loewe might be coming through it seems they are accepting solo offers which is good because all these 5th gen groups are bagging them and zb1 needs that extra exposure, I just hope they are accepting things that might come through for all the members and not just a few.</p>

      <p>yea dazed was supposed to be haobin only imagine my shock when they dropped their solo covers one hr apart and i was waiting to see if there was more i was PISST.... but the mag was too good i had to buy it. a solo brand deal is a far shot and super unlikely and there isnt much to go off of besides ig likes so idk
