      <p>I think they got overall closer recently but yeah the friendships are pretty limited it's
Hao, Hanbin, Gyuvin, Matthew (Matthew more close to 2binz but getting along w Hao lately)
Yujin, Ricky, Gyuvin, Gunwook (Ricky closer to kkongdakz but getting closer to Gunwook)
Taerae friends with Matthew and Hao

Now for the yeah I kinda like u but you're not my friend FRIEND there's more pairs but I'd say those are the cliques</p>

      <p>gunwook isnâ€™t in that first clique can you be serious ðŸ˜­ gyuvin isnâ€™t really either itâ€™s more like he hangs out with them and is friends with them separately there is no clique there. the only real clique is maknaez (including ricky) everyone else just kinda mixes and matches</p>
