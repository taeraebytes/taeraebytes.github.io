      <p>Not to stir this but I saw this one chick on wb saying sheâ€™s going but this same person posted a pic saying he deserved to have his head ch*pipes off for â€˜stealingâ€™ the centre position. Iâ€™m not saying these people will do stuff but if you were in this position would you not also feel a little worried because thatâ€™s not something a sane person would be saying.</p>

      <p>I donâ€™t think anything would happen but can you say you wouldnâ€™t be worried if you knew someone who said that gw should be beheaded would be less that 5 feet away from him. Like nothing will happen but the fact someone who can say such things gets to be that close to them is irritating</p>

      <p>i would be worried but like i said theres nothing u can do and nobody really puts actions to their words like all i can do is pray for him. but also theres ppl who do blow things out of proportion wishing for all chinese promotion to be eradicated thats different than simple worrying that might not be u but its a bbit of a consensus but ultimately i think hanbin will be fine he might just get ignored but he also has a fandom there hell b aight
