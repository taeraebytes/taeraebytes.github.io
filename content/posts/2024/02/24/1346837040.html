      <p>I think you can tell the difference like he seems close with hanbin but speaks formally because he respects him a lot the same way Matthew is really close to hanbin but says he still uses formal language with him because he respects him a lot. But there‚Äôs other relationships like Gunwook and Taerae or Gunwook and Jiwoong where it‚Äôs more obvious that it‚Äôs just because they aren‚Äôt close at all.</p>

      <p>Yea hanbin is just cuz he admires him there's a distance still between them cuz they're less friends but more a strong uhhh brotherhood? Idk but yea taerae and jiwoong he don't know those ppl

      <p>I am sorry but sometimes I wonder how much of an ego hanbin has, I feel like people suck up to him a little bit too much. The whole i want to be like him and I respect him so muchüòç thingy gunwook, matthew, yujin and gyuvin have for him is just too much.</p>

      <p>honestly yujin doesnt but i guess those 3 seem like they like reliable figures like gyuvins an oldest child who now has to have a responsible influence like he needs thats... and matthew and gunwook are little brothers so its natural for them

      <p>I feel like you can tell whose ego has been Inflated but he doesn‚Äôt seem to give of those vibes. Plus he‚Äôs a nice person and in a way I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs him the younger ones look up to as an older brother / leader than someone else üëÄ</p>
