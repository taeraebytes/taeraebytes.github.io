      <p>Not zb1. Wasn't the Lucas scandal made up by a sasaeng? Dunno much about nct and whatever unit he's in but I remember reading somewhere in these type of gossip cc's that a sasaeng didn't like him and some other members so they made up a bunch of rumors or something.</p>

      <p>Oh nooooo his scandal was very much real and blasted by multiple girls he wronged. it got watered down a lot so ppl chalk it up to infidelity when it was more sexual assault and I think rape
