      <p>Not to stir this but I saw this one chick on wb saying sheâ€™s going but this same person posted a pic saying he deserved to have his head ch*pipes off for â€˜stealingâ€™ the centre position. Iâ€™m not saying these people will do stuff but if you were in this position would you not also feel a little worried because thatâ€™s not something a sane person would be saying.</p>
