      <p>"i think allins are just scared no one is gonna cheer for hanbin" people underestimate the power of pretty boys too much. one cheeky smile from any of the members and the crowd will go wild. eb talks big online but it's different when they are in front of you. that's how some peoples biases change. #gunwookrisingonthecside 🕯️🕯️🕯️</p>
