      <p>for ricky standards and the fact that there isnt much disclosed except for gyuvin says and sometimes someone else theres smth there and they have a bit of a relationship outside of regular courtesy like gunwook and taerae. for a member relationship theyre ok but its nothing outside the favt that theyre both zb1 members.
