      <p>i'm sorry to burst rosins bubble but we are never getting that loewe x zhang hao brand deal. if anything it will be a jiwoong and hb x gucci thing ðŸ˜ª. that guy is following over 3000 people and likes most of the posts of that women since they are business partners, don't get your hopes up</p>
