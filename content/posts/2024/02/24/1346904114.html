      <p>I don't give a shit about brand deals or so but Wakeone needs to accept solo brand deals now like. They're the only ones who hasn't got one yet 😭😭

      <p>I don’t know if they will accept brand deals ? Or at least solo ones. I can’t remember any produce group members who got solo brand deals while they were in the group.</p>
