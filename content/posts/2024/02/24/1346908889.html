      <p>"I wonder how jw fans react though if hb did end up getting smth with Gucci / they keep dressing him and not jw" Jiwoong could just keep dressing himself with Guccis old releases. His fans wouldn't notice a thing and would say he still is getting dressed by Gucci and that noone can break his spirit/passion for the job ðŸ’€</p>
