      <p>i'm sorry to burst rosins bubble but we are never getting that loewe x zhang hao brand deal. if anything it will be a jiwoong and hb x gucci thing ðŸ˜ª. that guy is following over 3000 people and likes most of the posts of that women since they are business partners, don't get your hopes up</p>

      <p>no one is gonna wanna work with jw after what happened lmfaooo his reputation is in the gutter to the gp and even if he still has fans who support him no business will ever want to be associated with that kind of negative image. i suggest he makes the most out of the time he has left with the group because once they disband he's literally dun for</p>

      <p>Do you think thatâ€™s why Gucci may have stopped associating with them? If w1 really likes him they may have pulled a dazed and said you canâ€™t have hb if you drop jw and then bothe just end up being dropped instead ?</p>

      <p>I didnâ€™t think the Gucci thing was serious until they invited them to that Wkorea event under their name/brand, especially when you consider they had their own Korean ambassadors at the time who they didnâ€™t send.</p>
