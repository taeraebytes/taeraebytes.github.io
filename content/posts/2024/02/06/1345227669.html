      <p>nah I hope it gets bigger, hope the gp starts shitting on them to the point some start dragging in the other members and then the gp would start to pity the other members because they had nothing to do with this and give them the pity card and promise to support them if jw leaves. Then I hope jw leaves and their korea cb gets announced and now the k gp supports zb1 aka zb8 and makes zb8 big because they dont want them to flop now that jw left in fact theyre pety bitches and want them to have massive success so jw can be miserable and regret his actions.</p>

      <p>oh no not this hard... realistically jiwoong is not leaving and a hiatus is also unlikely but a likkle one month hiatus would do us right
