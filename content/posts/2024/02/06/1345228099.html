      <p>this is one of gyuvin’s troll stans and they’re an absolute menace. i remember they posted gyuvin’s love killa fancam asking how he debuted and the tweet blew up. then months later they deleted it and said if they knew they were going to like him for this long they wouldn’t have kept the tweet up. they also were one of his fans that kept mentioning that he gained weight and were happy that he lost it.</p>
