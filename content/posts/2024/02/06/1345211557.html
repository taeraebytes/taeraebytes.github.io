      <p>"allin twt just two dumb bitches telling eo exactlyyyyyy" anon what do you expect from akgaes ðŸ˜‚ akgaes are akgaeing, the grass is green, water is wet... do i have to go on? i feel like actual zeroses or solo fans got something bigger to worry about than what four akgaes on x think. at least those people stopped talking about gw tho ðŸ˜‚ those people are just looking for fights, they dont care about their bias</p>
