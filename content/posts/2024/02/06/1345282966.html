      <p>nah I hope it gets bigger, hope the gp starts shitting on them to the point some start dragging in the other members and then the gp would start to pity the other members because they had nothing to do with this and give them the pity card and promise to support them if jw leaves. Then I hope jw leaves and their korea cb gets announced and now the k gp supports zb1 aka zb8 and makes zb8 big because they dont want them to flop now that jw left in fact theyre pety bitches and want them to have massive success so jw can be miserable and regret his actions.</p>

      <p>oh no not this hard... realistically jiwoong is not leaving and a hiatus is also unlikely but a likkle one month hiatus would do us right

      <p>I responded earlier already (hao hanbin gunwook taerae gyuvin), i used to love ricky but him being inactive made me drop him, i never liked jw but now i just hate him, i never cared about matthew but i like him when i see him interact with the members, and for yujin i'm just way too old to even pay attention to him. I kinda wanted to hype him like a son but i don't even care about my lil siblings like that lol i can't fake it but i don't hate him i just don't see him.</p>
