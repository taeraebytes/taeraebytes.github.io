      <p>"allin twt just two dumb bitches telling eo exactlyyyyyy" anon what do you expect from akgaes ðŸ˜‚ akgaes are akgaeing, the grass is green, water is wet... do i have to go on? i feel like actual zeroses or solo fans got something bigger to worry about than what four akgaes on x think. at least those people stopped talking about gw tho ðŸ˜‚ those people are just looking for fights, they dont care about their bias</p>

      <p>even akgaes of other members aren't this delusional im ngl and an akgae doesn't mean you get to LIE. you don't like other members yes fine wdrc but to lie on their skills when everyone outside your cult is laughing at how stupid you look.</p>
