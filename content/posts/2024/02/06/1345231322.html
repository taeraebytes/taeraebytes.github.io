      <p>put this through a translator and i'm confused does this mean a hiatus will be announced then or the 'results' of the investigation? i assume the 1st since u mentioned it. i wouldn't be surprised tbh (tho literally anyone could post this on instiz), idols have to put on a nice face for the public all the time so he was probably trying to look Normal lmao. not to overanalyse but his eyes looked a bit teary in some of the pics</p>

      <p>They just said there will be an announcement on the 7th and that to just wait and see. That's what I got from it but idk he looked more lit than he's looked for anything it would've been better to look sad cuz otherwise he'll get called shameless which is happening but let me check

      <p>I dont think he looked happier than usual but he had a lot of people supporting him like 15 of his fansites including inactive ones came and there was a couple of fans holding jiwoong cards i think he was just grateful tbh</p>
