      <p>ooo this may be true and I think it's possible they decided after yesterdays appearance because as soon as the gp saw him in press photos there was really bad backlash on the kside. Apparently that's why zb1 didnt leave from the front yesterday in front of fans and media and a bunch of zeroses were pissed because they waited for hours in the cold, snow and rain but zb1 never came out. The managers came out and went back into the building so they knew the fans were waiting outside but said nothing to them and left in the back quietly.
