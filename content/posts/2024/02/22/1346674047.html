      <p>the sponsorship was lowkey to begin with but Gucci was only just dressing them too it wasn't a serious relationship and they dressed hao? Recently so they could just move to a diff member if they rlly cared

      <p>I’m so sorry but who let you be this level of delusional 😭 who enabled this 😭😭 even more famous kpop idols that are miles more popular than zb1 and globally known still can’t bag an invite to fashion week.</p>

      <p>Right like people don't realize how prestigious these events are and no shade kpop idols aren't taken seriously enough for them to be regulars maybe a few standouts but that's it

      <p>same w brand ambassadors like most groups don’t get them unless they’re massive like even big 4 groups need to have some sort of hype even if they have connections. like sorry but nobody in zb1 is becoming an ambassador or getting a fashion week invite. nobody in the group is outstandingly popular either in sk or intl and the group itself is only rly known in a very niche part of the kpop community. also even if they were, they’re a temp group so they can’t get offers bc would need individual sns. but even ricky isn’t known enough to be invited to fw. and brands sponsor/dress idols all the time it doesn’t mean anything and i doubt it would fe affected by the jw thing bc the purpose is to get their fans to buy their clothes</p>

      <p>I learned about the levels of sponsorship and ambassadorship recently when I watched a deep dive on kris wu. Unless you come from a company with good connections (even at that it's hard you need well established popularity) you're not getting an ambassadorship because you literally are a representative of some sort now. And zb1 would be FUCKED if they actually had one rn😭 plus it's veeeeeeeery hard to get a full group one and wakeone is def turning down a solo one. But yea the dressing really won't be affected by the scandal
