      <p>maybe i haven't been enough attention to their tiktoks but everything taerae was doing requires so much effort than most of his tiktoks, him doing all that just to continue pissing the people who didn't like the super lady challenges is soooo funny. also i haven't read this cc in like 24 days uh should i even bother trying to catch up atp</p>
