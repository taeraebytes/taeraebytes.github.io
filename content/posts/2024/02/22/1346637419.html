      <p>the sponsorship was lowkey to begin with but Gucci was only just dressing them too it wasn't a serious relationship and they dressed hao? Recently so they could just move to a diff member if they rlly cared

      <p>Right like people don't realize how prestigious these events are and no shade kpop idols aren't taken seriously enough for them to be regulars maybe a few standouts but that's it
