      <p>seeing all my zerose moots defend jiwoong on the tl is getting kinda embarrassing i can’t lie… i understand the inclination to defend your faves but we have to think rationally not everything our faves do should be defended. seeing people say that “she probably deserved it” or “i would love jiwoong to curse at me” is just spineless i don’t think jiwoong deserves the blow up of hate but he shouldn’t be coddled either at the end of the day this is still his job…</p>
