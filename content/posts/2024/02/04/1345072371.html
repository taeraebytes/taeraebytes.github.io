      <p>"Hello, I am writing an additional article due to speculation and indiscriminate personal attacks. After I posted the video, the company posted at that time that it would sue the invasion of the house and the fake rumors that were not related to my video. I am not the one who broke into the house, nor am I the one who contacted the members and spread the rumors. In an instant, people considered them and me for a while, and cursed at me, saying that I deserved to hear such a curse because I was the illegitimate one, and the rumors got bigger. There are ridiculous speculations and personal attacks such as that Kim Ji-woong's attitude must have been like that because his face was ugly, and that he must have been cursed at for talking about this drama. It's not true at all. I'm just a fan of Kim Ji-woong purely. At first, I thought I heard the wrong swear words, so I watched it again and again. After that, I watched the video over and over again thinking if I had a bad expression or if I said something wrong, but I don't know why the member did that to me, and it's so sad because I can't find my fault. I saw an article that testified this morning that he and the on-site staff had never done that. It's a fan signing event a week ago, and how can you officially say no even though there is clear video evidence by relying only on the on-site staff and your own memory? It's so unfair and upsetting that the company is driving individuals to spread rumors and saying everything is my fault. Please stop spreading false information, such as "It's a sketch," "It's a gay drama," and "It's because your face is ugly." Thank you for reading the long article."
This is what I got from papago
