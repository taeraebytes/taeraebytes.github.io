      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ well regardless the ig "chats" were photoshopped (the different default profile pictures) she claimed this happened in October @craft_bbe was created in November even with the story of he deleted his Instagram and she took the user to save it for "evidence" her friend exposed their chat where she bought the info in NOVEMBER and the @ was actually rapunta or something.

The toilet picture was clocked as bad photoshop anyways and because I use it a lot it's the type where it's added in like a sticker rather than taken out and that being the original. Her friends exposed her already for fabricating things plus the debacle with her YouTube channel being hacked.

The hotel photo with no watermark (gunwook1100 but a fat ass watermark on the expose acc) was dropped in the silent room and there's a screenshot of it before mods took it down since no unofficial photos are allowed in there. 

There's way too many holes in the original expose accs, the stories that came an entire day after, and the last few things she posted. She tried to clock the changing of the dates on photos but someone got her in the qrts and she entirely gave up the act saying "I'm glad you're smart"ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that's when her friends exposed her cuz they got annoyed at her not letting up. I'm under the impression (from translating her friends screenshots) that she tried to buy everyone's info but only accurately got gunwooks since she couldn't put her moves on anyone else. But yea even trolls gave up the set up story so we're all good
