      <p>diff anon here i'm thinking maybe she trauma-dumped on him and he really wasn't having it so he cursed after the fancall when he thought the call had ended? it's strange because this guessing-game of who's in the wrong can just end had she just posted the rest of the fancall to let us judge whether his response is acceptable given the context of what they talked about but she refuses to show us the rest of the call so either 1) she's a liar and it's edited or she said something hateful to him which led to that response or 2) she talked about a very personal topic like a trauma and doesn't want to share it to the masses. if she really was trauma-dumping then i can't blame him tho it's not his job to be a psychiatrist for his fan. but until we see the rest of the call i'm remaining neutral idk</p>

      <p>I don't rlly think the full call really changes anything unless she was being extremely over and out of bounds which I don't think happened. She seemed normal saod normal things maybe she did trauma dump but his attitude the whole time was sour. It's really all just about his attitude towards the work and letting that slip happen in front of her and she rlly did sound so depressed. The issue is that and the fact that hundreds of idols exists that have worse day worse demands and they never let the facade drop its more about him being incompetent and disrespectful cuz I don't rlly care about what he did

      <p>Yall gotta quit with the wishful thinking and accept that youâ€™re idol is an asshole no shade because for 1 wk1 is strict they wouldnâ€™t even allow her to trauma dump if she did and 2 they wouldnâ€™t have enough time for all of that in a fancall</p>
