 now that this is coming out ig it’s ok to share some more info but his mom is closing it due to health reasons and it seem like they’ve been long term. Remember during on of the award shown, pretty sure it was mma and hanbin left like and hour and a half before the show even ended and then told us on bubble he had to go back to cheonan ( his home town ) urgently. It was going around on the kside from his ssngs that a family members was really sick and had a health scare and that’s why he had to leave so urgently ( and tbh I believe it because in what other scenario would he have been allowed to leave an award show half way through) anyway people thought it was his grandfather but ig this is confirmation that it was actually his mom.</p>
