      <p>I don't think the sponsorship was that serious either when was the last time they got dressed by Gucci? But probably not it's not like they're ambassadors

Unless someone from the group went to fashion week, I'll just think it's all sponsored and all the brands are still trying to check who fits most on their brand especially since they're not from big4 where the whole group can be the ambassador as their company can back them up with connections</p>
