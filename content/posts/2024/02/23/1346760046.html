      <p>I don’t want to be a party pooper but chaemin resigned for another year in September 23 and eunchaes 1 year would have been up at the beginning of feb so she’s likely resigned. But they always do 1 male and female so we will have to wait till September 24 for that spot to possibly open again.</p>
