      <p>I donâ€™t want to be a party pooper but chaemin resigned for another year in September 23 and eunchaes 1 year would have been up at the beginning of feb so sheâ€™s likely resigned. But they always do 1 male and female so we will have to wait till September 24 for that spot to possibly open again.</p>

      <p>honestly the best thing would be for him to get a gig closer to the end of the zb1 contract bc most ppl leave after disbandment bc everyone kinda goes ia while they prepare to redebut but if he has a regular schedule heâ€™ll maintain his hype better</p>
