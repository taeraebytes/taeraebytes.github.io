      <p>Maybe it’s because I stanned wanna one all the way to zb1 in terms of survival groups but it does shock me how much they mention their own company trainee friends and groups they may possibly debut with in the future. Like every so often they throw a little reminder they are temporary and a soft launch of potential future groups which is insane because these other produce groups were even allowed to mention their trainee friends or companies. You can tell wakeone and yuehua have already established the groups they want post zb1 and I guess it helps relations between the two now that they have the remains trainees in evnne.</p>

      <p>I don't think wakeonez line up is that bad, munjung can be the filler member... they just need to add another main vocal with good dancing skills like a jihyo and they are set. Now... Yuehuaz are doomed.</p>
