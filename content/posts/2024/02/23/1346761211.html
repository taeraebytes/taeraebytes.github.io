      <p>Exactly. This is why my bias are gunwook and Zhang Hao in zb1. They look attractive with their smarts, no matter the sexual orientation of course</p>

      <p>Smart ppl are cute until u start dating them and I have first hand experience.

I dated this nerd and he was cute but broke up in 1 week. Bitchass won't stop correcting me like exqweesee meee It's actually called this 🤓☝️ I never felt so dumb in my life and they're stereotypically anal for a reason like they don't understand the concept of a joke. Everything has to be technical to them k cool you a bio major congrats idgaf about ur cells let's part ways now. Never again.</p>
