      <p>let him talk about evnne damn what's the problem? on bubble itself he only mentions them like once a month anyway and I don't think you can compare "uri" to the regular "our" we use here he's obviously not saying munjung is zeroses baby ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>yes i'm replying to this cc from 16 days ago ANYWAY i would actually like if jiwoong talked about his ex-groupmates, the way he doesn't acknowledge his prior groups or seobin or his bls at all is kind of unnerving. like if i didn't already know he dgaf about zb1 i'd be worried that he wouldn't care much about zb1 after they disband bc he doesn't show emotional attachment to anyone in his past really</p>
