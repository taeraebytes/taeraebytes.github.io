      <p>the way gunwooks visuals shine when he is next to yujin and hanbin. they should out these three together more often. wakeone loves putting gunwook together with mt or tr... pls put these two together with jw (i'll call them shibal line)</p>

      <p>There's a thing called visual chemistry that I'm not going to explain to u bcuz clearly u have rocks for brains.. but if its not as enhanced with mattrae what can u do ab that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è its especially odd since he's like 5-6 inches taller
