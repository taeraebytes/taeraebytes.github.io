      <p>I literally donâ€™t understand the appeal of photocard collecting it seems so wasteful and it can get expensive just for some piece of cardboard</p>

      <p>anon sounds like they don't know what a hobby is. not everything needs to have a life changing purpose like as long as it brings ppl happiness its what matters and as long as its not hurting someone else. I literally don't understand people who don't understand this simple concept.</p>

      <p>Jfjrjfjdkfkktkckkd I get it since it's a hobby that means u have to spend copious amounts of money but yea I don't think it's hard to understand me and my collectors enjoy it

      <p>anon I kinda get it bc I also collect stupid little figures to decorate my room I just feel like photocards just lay in a binder forgotten forever which makes it less appealing to collecting trinkets</p>

      <p>It depends on how you treat them I rotate all my gunwook pcs in my holders and take different ones with me or I just display some on my desk
