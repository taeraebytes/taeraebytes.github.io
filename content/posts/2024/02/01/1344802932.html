      <p>the way zb1 is losing fans left an right. tws and riize will surpass them by the time their next comeback arrives. i get it tho, im tempted to leave this fandom too. w1 doesnt know how to promote the group. nobody except for sfs cares about the ost or solo pictorials, the same thing goes for mc jobs. nobody gaf w1. zbtv format is shit too. the only good thing are the zb1_folder episodes or zb1cams, those actually show the members being unfiltered</p>

      <p>i feel like u can tell that they've hired some new ppl tho like there was that job notice and there just feels like there's been a shift in their social media stuff recently so hopefully that's the case and it gets better. idk maybe i just want everyone to have a bit of faith bc this stuff makes me sad to think about. i'm not gonna leave them unless the members do something really heinous and the music goes to utter shit (i like pretty much all their music so i'm good for now tho i know that's subjective) IN COMBINATION with the company's crimes like i came for the members and i'm still here bc of the members i feel like that mark lee instagram story where he's like pleaseeeeeeeee guys get along 🙏 like PLEASE SUPPORT ZB1 🙏</p>

      <p>I still have my faith but I think so too and they're doing side shows which look fun and engaging jfjrmmfdkd I like how there's balancing emotions some of these anons get too depressing for me

      <p>matthew said in a live yesterday that they’re recording something that he’s really excited for today and it could be just regular mv stuff but it could also be fun content so i’m gonna be optimistic and hope for that i think we have nowhere to go but up from here let’s all be positive guys😁🤞</p>
