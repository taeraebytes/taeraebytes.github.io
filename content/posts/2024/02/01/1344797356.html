      <p>the way zb1 is losing fans left an right. tws and riize will surpass them by the time their next comeback arrives. i get it tho, im tempted to leave this fandom too. w1 doesnt know how to promote the group. nobody except for sfs cares about the ost or solo pictorials, the same thing goes for mc jobs. nobody gaf w1. zbtv format is shit too. the only good thing are the zb1_folder episodes or zb1cams, those actually show the members being unfiltered</p>

      <p>idk what that last comment means but I think a lot of it is just behind the scenes of getting ready which gets old if they showed other things ppl would watch I don't get the whole thing ab format cuz it's like... editing isn't gonna so much the format is fine it's the source material
