      <p>the way zb1 is losing fans left an right. tws and riize will surpass them by the time their next comeback arrives. i get it tho, im tempted to leave this fandom too. w1 doesnt know how to promote the group. nobody except for sfs cares about the ost or solo pictorials, the same thing goes for mc jobs. nobody gaf w1. zbtv format is shit too. the only good thing are the zb1_folder episodes or zb1cams, those actually show the members being unfiltered</p>
