cause from what I got is cfans said wakeone are ignoring them with their pink microphone ideas and started cross posting from weibo to twt and we latched on and starting spamming them hastags. But later someone said it's because yujin wanted a black mic but his cfans said it was too boring and want to give him a pink mic so wakeone is prob ignoring those pink mic ideas because its not what yujin wants.</p>
