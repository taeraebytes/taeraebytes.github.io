      <p>zb1 are literally a produce group quit trying to push the rags to riches story on them they get just as much if not more payola as big 4 bg rookies and came out the womb selling 1m bc they were formed from the biggest idol survival show series on national television. they literally have 2 osts, been on countless variety shows (the amt of promotions they get for releases is insane), mcountdown, and probably more bc of cj and mnet. ur just mad they‚Äôre flopping compared to other rookies & past produce groups</p>

The big 4 yeaaaaüòÇüòÇüòÇ like irdc ab zb1s fame anymore but why r u mad like let's be calm now

      <p>after the produce scandal the general pop stopped tuning in. i was there for girls planet IT WAS THE TRENCHES! boys planet got big because of the trainees that is the main reason, the show being under mnet was an afterthought. i don't stan zb1 now i solo stan a member but let's be for fucking real</p>

      <p>Boys planet was honestly a miracle story after gp999 and they're not even produceüò≠ survival shows have such a terrible image after x1 and fantasy boys first episode viewership rating was higher than boys planets first episode it just shows u the margin of what they were getting. Like let's be logicalüôè

      <p>yurina my one pick was the gyuvin of the season she didn't excel in anything but she was a fucking visual and could decently sing and dance and is so fucking gorgeous. but because korean votes were weighted so high she got screwed over. i am more of a keplian than i am a zerose i only like hao taerae hanbin ricky (and gyuvin because of my own yurina comparisons) people need to know the show being part of the "produce lineup" didn't help get fans attention AT ALL it in fact turned people against them</p>
