      <p>zb1 are literally a produce group quit trying to push the rags to riches story on them they get just as much if not more payola as big 4 bg rookies and came out the womb selling 1m bc they were formed from the biggest idol survival show series on national television. they literally have 2 osts, been on countless variety shows (the amt of promotions they get for releases is insane), mcountdown, and probably more bc of cj and mnet. ur just mad they’re flopping compared to other rookies & past produce groups</p>

The big 4 yeaaaa😂😂😂 like irdc ab zb1s fame anymore but why r u mad like let's be calm now

      <p>Boys planet was honestly a miracle story after gp999 and they're not even produce😭 survival shows have such a terrible image after x1 and fantasy boys first episode viewership rating was higher than boys planets first episode it just shows u the margin of what they were getting.
