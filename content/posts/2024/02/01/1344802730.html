      <p>the way zb1 is losing fans left an right. tws and riize will surpass them by the time their next comeback arrives. i get it tho, im tempted to leave this fandom too. w1 doesnt know how to promote the group. nobody except for sfs cares about the ost or solo pictorials, the same thing goes for mc jobs. nobody gaf w1. zbtv format is shit too. the only good thing are the zb1_folder episodes or zb1cams, those actually show the members being unfiltered</p>

      <p>idk what that last comment means but I think a lot of it is just behind the scenes of getting ready which gets old if they showed other things ppl would watch I don't get the whole thing ab format cuz it's like... editing isn't gonna so much the format is fine it's the source material

      <p>i personally don't get the zepisode outrage bc it's the exact same content as every other group i've stanned tbh like i've always found those not that exciting but necessary bc if they don't record the process of these schedules then fans schiz out. i feel like what they should do in addition to the zepisodes is more content like mattparkz mukbang and the upcoming hariboz salon with different duos/units and swap them around and do different activities, make them more frequent too since that mukbang video was like a month ago. like that's the REAL problem imo, especially since zbtv is still not back. if mattparkz/hariboz are busy filming this content, then other duos/units should be able to also film content at the same time and then it can become a regular thing</p>

      <p>The side shows look fun and if they have a decent schedule it'll be better but with the state of this fandom constant duo content will make people tweak they need to create a looser theme for zbtv and dive into other things beside music show behinds for zepisodes cuz honestly they're not bad they're very standard
