thoughts?

imo itâ€™s pretty obvious she used to wear hip pads before she suddenly had those small waist and curvy hips in U Go Girl? like if you look at her previous photos her waist to hip line was pretty straight and no such obvious curves like what she has now, in some other photos her hip pads were really obvious too. itâ€™s impossible to grow your hips or pelvis so suddenly like how she did. i think she underwent some cosmetic hip surgery or hip fillers to get her curvy hips and i think she looks great now but she needs to stop acting like itâ€™s naturalðŸ˜‘</p>

      <p>I'm sorry but you sound crazy like she debuted at 15 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and she did not go through no surgery like jfjrjfmkfkdkmdkdkd. It's obvious this is a mixture of puberty and just fat loss yes your hips can grow that's the point of puberty she was a kid. The rise of your pants really does change how your hip line looks I look diff in high and low rise. It's sad that she had to address this on television like if she was wearing hip pads it would be glaringly obvious and just going off of her waist line those are her hips
