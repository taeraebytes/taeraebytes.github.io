      <p>zb1 are literally a produce group quit trying to push the rags to riches story on them they get just as much if not more payola as big 4 bg rookies and came out the womb selling 1m bc they were formed from the biggest idol survival show series on national television. they literally have 2 osts, been on countless variety shows (the amt of promotions they get for releases is insane), mcountdown, and probably more bc of cj and mnet. ur just mad they’re flopping compared to other rookies & past produce groups</p>
