She isn’t starting the new year too good either lol her label keeps pushing back her debut album because they have no trust in her and she’s already getting into controversy, She asked us to mind our business and for privacy and I’ll be doing just that by not supporting his or her projects. I’m not supporting anything she or her man does. She’s a mean girl colorist that enables her bf and he’s an asshole troll.I will never support any of her projects because I am minding the business that pays me and none of these celebs pay me so they will never get my support.I encourage y’all to do the same.",
