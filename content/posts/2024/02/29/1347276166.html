      <p>Just to clear up a misconception I’ve seen in your cc but I’ve interned at a big fashion house for a while and payolaing your idol into events or a BA really isn’t as simple as people make out and even then I don’t think wakeone has any means to do it. I’ve seen people think wakeone is the one who included Yujin in that Loewe event but I disagree wakeone may have influence over smaller things like magazine shoots ( that aren’t brand sponsored) and variety appearances even special stages but when big international companies involved they either get who they want or they will just no longer involve themselves with the group. It’s why I’m suprised hanbin is still attending the Gucci event because if wakeone was adamant about jiwoong being kept apart of that deal most companies would have simply pulled out all together it’s not really a financial loss on them is it.</p>

      <p>Wow Hanbin really won then because they can’t add another member in and now it’s a solo endorsement which is always better than a duo/ group one</p>

      <p>Depending on who else is going to that event may make it obvious about how serious they are because as of right now it seems like most the lineup is their house ambassadors and global ambassadors. The creative director is flying into Seoul to attend as well so in terms of events it’s a lot different from when they (jw+hb) attended the new flagship store back in July 23 as in this is a bigger event and the guest list is more selective.</p>

      <p>Not gonna lie, seeing as the line up also has tzuyu and jihyo, based on the one selling data, it's probably not serious serious, but the only true thing about it is they #kickedjiwoong

Loewe also invited their global ambassador taeyong for that thing with luckyz</p>
