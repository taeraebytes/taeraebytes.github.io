      <p>I like Hanbin y'all but I have a slight criticism don't jump me tmh is my fav zb1 song but his high note at the end is very unpleasant and clearly not his range and you can hear it even with the hybe level of insane vocal retouching in this album and it bothers me so much omg you could just take out that high note? Or make it lower?</p>

      <p>I don't know why they don't just get taerae to do the high notes like he's best equipped I get that hanbin has that poppy airy light voice which SHOULD sound good but can't pull it off correctly, taerae voice has strong ballad vibe which may not fit the song but I would rather hear someone able to hit the note</p>

      <p>They just need to lower the range tbh you're not supposed to hear someone struggling in a recorded edited album kfhdkdkm and they're pretty skilled vocally Kpop is just obsessed with super high songs q</p>
