      <p>Just to clear up a misconception Iâ€™ve seen in your cc but Iâ€™ve interned at a big fashion house for a while and payolaing your idol into events or a BA really isnâ€™t as simple as people make out and even then I donâ€™t think wakeone has any means to do it. Iâ€™ve seen people think wakeone is the one who included Yujin in that Loewe event but I disagree wakeone may have influence over smaller things like magazine shoots ( that arenâ€™t brand sponsored) and variety appearances even special stages but when big international companies involved they either get who they want or they will just no longer involve themselves with the group. Itâ€™s why Iâ€™m suprised hanbin is still attending the Gucci event because if wakeone was adamant about jiwoong being kept apart of that deal most companies would have simply pulled out all together itâ€™s not really a financial loss on them is it.</p>

      <p>Same anon who just replied to this cc but this programme I was on had some pretty famous alumni so there were connections everywhere for summer programs ect but it was really competitive and probably the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever tried to go for</p>
