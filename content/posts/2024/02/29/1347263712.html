      <p>Just to clear up a misconception I’ve seen in your cc but I’ve interned at a big fashion house for a while and payolaing your idol into events or a BA really isn’t as simple as people make out and even then I don’t think wakeone has any means to do it. I’ve seen people think wakeone is the one who included Yujin in that Loewe event but I disagree wakeone may have influence over smaller things like magazine shoots ( that aren’t brand sponsored) and variety appearances even special stages but when big international companies involved they either get who they want or they will just no longer involve themselves with the group. It’s why I’m suprised hanbin is still attending the Gucci event because if wakeone was adamant about jiwoong being kept apart of that deal most companies would have simply pulled out all together it’s not really a financial loss on them is it.</p>
