      <p>If Hanbin was dating or dated a crosin woulda most def leaked it a long time ago, he might have dated a dude on the low but impossible to know cause he would obviously be private about it, I think he knows it and won't have any actual relationships during the contracts outside hook ups
Those that can date without worrying besides the ones we already know are Taerae and Matthew lmao I have no proofs but I'm convinced Taerae is in a relationship or is at least fucking around</p>

      <p>NRNNFJDJFKFKDK what makes y think taerae is hooking up I don't think he is and don't say the neck stuff I don't think those are hickeys. Matthew probably could he'd have it easier but he would get exposed out of spite or hatred if it got found out
