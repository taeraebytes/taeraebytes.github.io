      <p>I remember it got deleted because all it was was a screenshot of his old insta account commenting on his male friends live something like he‚Äôs so nice ( or something like that) and people tried to say it was his bf. Except it didn‚Äôt stick because aside from the sc there was absolutely nothing else to go off and even that screenshot is not proof because it‚Äôs just him complementing a friend.</p>

      <p>Oh so it's exactly what the classmate thing was either those girls took their findings from instiz or they're the ones that brought it on there but the ig acc was a burner with 1 follower it didn't look real

      <p>I think the thing from IG live was speculation from intl fans or I personally haven't seen it myself, what I remember is that one of his old friends or classmate alleged that he had a bf in his team which isn't a huze stretch or particularly interesting but there were no actual evidences 
He's also been speculated to date each of his fag hags but they were clearly his friends</p>

      <p>I‚Äôve seen the video, but tbh that‚Äôs not what was said in the video, he was talking in Korean with no captions, so obviously someone could pass around misinformation. Iirc they asked him for his thoughts on todays video</p>
