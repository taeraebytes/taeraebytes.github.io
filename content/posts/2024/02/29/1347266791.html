      <p>Just to clear up a misconception I’ve seen in your cc but I’ve interned at a big fashion house for a while and payolaing your idol into events or a BA really isn’t as simple as people make out and even then I don’t think wakeone has any means to do it. I’ve seen people think wakeone is the one who included Yujin in that Loewe event but I disagree wakeone may have influence over smaller things like magazine shoots ( that aren’t brand sponsored) and variety appearances even special stages but when big international companies involved they either get who they want or they will just no longer involve themselves with the group. It’s why I’m suprised hanbin is still attending the Gucci event because if wakeone was adamant about jiwoong being kept apart of that deal most companies would have simply pulled out all together it’s not really a financial loss on them is it.</p>

      <p>Same anon who just replied to this cc but this programme I was on had some pretty famous alumni so there were connections everywhere for summer programs ect but it was really competitive and probably the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to go for</p>

      <p>Yes I was living there for just under 2 years but I interned for 3 months over the summer. I can’t lie it was not Emily in Paris 😭 Emily though she was getting treated like dirt I was getting treated like dog shit. Although it did prepare me for the industry, like these people are not nice everyone is nasty and cut throat. I felt like a glorified assistant but I got to know a lot of insider talk because the would just talk quite freely in the building and if there wasn’t visitors.</p>
