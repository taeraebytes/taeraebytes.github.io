      <p>I like Hanbin y'all but I have a slight criticism don't jump me tmh is my fav zb1 song but his high note at the end is very unpleasant and clearly not his range and you can hear it even with the hybe level of insane vocal retouching in this album and it bothers me so much omg you could just take out that high note? Or make it lower?</p>

      <p>I don't know why they don't just get taerae to do the high notes like he's best equipped I get that hanbin has that poppy airy light voice which SHOULD sound good but can't pull it off correctly, taerae voice has strong ballad vibe which may not fit the song but I would rather hear someone able to hit the note</p>

      <p>taerae would also butcher hes not equipped for that range hes definitely more skilled but not that high imo hao probably could he has technique and i think he has a pretty high range but its whatever what can u do

      <p>They just need to lower the range tbh you're not supposed to hear someone struggling in a recorded edited album kfhdkdkm and they're pretty skilled vocally Kpop is just obsessed with super high songs q</p>

      <p>you can make anyone sound good with post production but zb1s music is already over processed they dont need more they just need a producer thatll give them good songs

      <p>the reason why they are going that high it's bc of the damn Hybe producers, the ones from txt are working with zb1 and that's why we are getting those crazy high pitched vocals. 

also Sakura does sound bad on their songs and I won't even talk about Kazuha "raps"</p>
