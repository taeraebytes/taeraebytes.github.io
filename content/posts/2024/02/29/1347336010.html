      <p>Not comparable at all obviously she's one of the top singer rn but I'm a Beyonce fan and as her voice matured her productions have changed and her old songs are rearranged to fit her songs better and she sounds SOOO much better like renaissance was her vocal peak and she's always been good, I wish Kpop valued deeper richer voices</p>
