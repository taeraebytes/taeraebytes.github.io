      <p>I don’t think it’s an event I think it’s just a different flight for Kcon or back from Kcon because all their other post specifically say when it’s a brand event and this one just says flight info</p>

      <p>That's probably the case there's been an influx of these accs so they keep flights and scheds separate but sometimes the flight ppl get to it first but I douuuuubt they're giving these two a sched 😭 so yea
