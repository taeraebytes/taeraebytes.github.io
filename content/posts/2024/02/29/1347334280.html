      <p>I like Hanbin y'all but I have a slight criticism don't jump me tmh is my fav zb1 song but his high note at the end is very unpleasant and clearly not his range and you can hear it even with the hybe level of insane vocal retouching in this album and it bothers me so much omg you could just take out that high note? Or make it lower?</p>

      <p>I don't know why they don't just get taerae to do the high notes like he's best equipped I get that hanbin has that poppy airy light voice which SHOULD sound good but can't pull it off correctly, taerae voice has strong ballad vibe which may not fit the song but I would rather hear someone able to hit the note</p>

      <p>Hao has a stronger voice but it doesn’t reach higher notes as well, a classic example is both hao and hanbin doing the kick it high note both can hit it but hanbin can hit the higher note with less strain. Hao definitely has the wider range and better technique but his voice isn’t as naturally airy or high. Hanbin said he’s been going for vocal lessons so let’s just hope his technique improves.</p>
