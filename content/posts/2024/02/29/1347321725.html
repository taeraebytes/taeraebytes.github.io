      <p>do you think if a rumor ab hanbin having a bf was uploaded and it was even slightly plausible it wouldn't have been everywhere? it obviously came off unbelievable I didn't see it myself but if it was anything like that other rumor ab his classmate it's just bs

      <p>The only dating rumors with proofs we've seen are of Jiwoong, Gyuvin and Yujin ( obviously Hao had ex bfs but it was before training) everything about Hanbin are just random posts on instiz w no proofs like you said even Mrs song and the sasaeng things have more proofs, if Hanbin had dated a woman we would already know, and a man wouldn't have leaked since his circle of friends he would be out to would be small</p>

      <p>I'm ngl I fully believe in the jiwoong thing and the proof lies in the kfan reaction imo but I actually never saw it myself except for anecdotal evidence that makes sense but yea there's proof with those two (for gyuvin I do believe he was dating recently and his early string of breakdowns just looked like breakup depression to me) but yea the mrs song and allin stuff was more interesting there was actually stuff to say about it but I feel like he was motae solo like his friend said
