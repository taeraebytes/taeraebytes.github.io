      <p>i got sad when looking at the pics from the photowall bc u can tell he's going hard with the weight loss like mannnnnnnn. sometimes it doesn't bother me as much but then other times i notice it like now. but also, response to another ask here since i don't wanna send multiple lmao, i actually like when he has his forehead out bc i like his eyebrows and it feels like we never see them, they're nicely shaped idk. maybe they could find a way to style it differently but still have forehead out as compromise?</p>

      <p>(more serious talk Abt Ed)
I've talked about this w someone earlier but the hard thing about idols with eds (aka all idols) is that people will talk about their weights and body all the time be it positively and negatively and when you know someone w an Ed the best way to help is just to take their minds of their bodies, hang out etc..
For Hanbin there's another layer of him having grown up fat so he's extra insecure (and you can tell he's just an insecure and anxious person in general) and I think he really really hyperfixates on how he's perceived and thus is very controlling with his appearance, in the end this will bring more bad than good but it's so hard to escape this mindset in the Kpop industry I just hope he (and Hao and Jiwoong) goes to therapy man</p>
