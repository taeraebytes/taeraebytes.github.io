      <p>I've literally almost never seen as much hit hate tweets towards an idol like I've seen towards Jiwoong today idk how the company didn't let him go earlier</p>

      <p>They will never ever let him go idk what it is but also I don't think any other group would kick out a member for this except some big4

      <p>what's crazy is i don't even remember the seunghan scandal getting this much engagement even tho it felt so much bigger imo, like i thought nothing would top that for these new idols... but yeah wow this is terrible. i wonder what's in it for us in the future now that this has happened :/</p>

      <p>This feels 10x bigger and it's that way because of how wakeone is handling it versus how seunghan handled and seunghan didn't even cuss and he apologized and did a "voluntary" hiatus I don't think it was fully his choice but it was swift and clean

      <p>It's basically because of the response of Wakeone, his fans and jw himself.

They made it so much bigger</p>

      <p>Yup they honestly could've handled this much better issues a private apology and compensation a statement about reflection and a public apology and not only would zb1 have exposure this wouldn't be a problem anymore
