      <p>like we got some idols who said n words, bullying their own members, smoking issues and alleged dating scandal but those were not that bad like jiwoong ðŸ¤’ knetz who tweets about jiwoong always gain 20k-50k retweets in almost an hour and too much articles ðŸ˜­ i really think jiwoong should apologize i think this is what those prideful knetz are waiting for.. like maybe they were offended that jiwoong didnâ€™t give a damn about the shit he has done.</p>
