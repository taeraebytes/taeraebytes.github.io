      <p>its international jiwoongs fans saying its a rumor so international fans wont spread the video but u can clearly hear it. honestly the international side is on some propaganda typa shit because theyre saying everything knets says are lies or jw antis and international fans are all falling for it. some international zeroses actually believe its not bad on the kside and believe the only hate is from anti jw but its the entire korean general public and its so fcking bad all of pann, instiz and theqoo is of jiwoong memeing and shitting on him and k twitter getting so many qrts hating on him too.
