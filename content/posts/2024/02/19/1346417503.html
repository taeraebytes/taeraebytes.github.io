      <p>They will never ever let him go idk what it is but also I don't think any other group would kick out a member for this except some big4

      <p>what's crazy is i don't even remember the seunghan scandal getting this much engagement even tho it felt so much bigger imo, like i thought nothing would top that for these new idols... but yeah wow this is terrible. i wonder what's in it for us in the future now that this has happened :/</p>

      <p>This feels 10x bigger and it's that way because of how wakeone is handling it versus how seunghan handled and seunghan didn't even cuss and he apologized and did a "voluntary" hiatus I don't think it was fully his choice but it was swift and clean

      <p>It's basically because of the response of Wakeone, his fans and jw himself.

They made it so much bigger</p>

      <p>Yup they honestly could've handled this much better issues a private apology and compensation a statement about reflection and a public apology and not only would zb1 have exposure this wouldn't be a problem anymore

      <p>The fact that they still haven't contacted the fan is pissing me off. It's a fancall you have all their personal information so try to handle it behind the scenes, maybe slip some hush hush money if he did cuss at her or if she lying you have her info so sue that bitch instead of going to dispatch releasing some vague ass article that provided no answers except for more speculations.</p>

      <p>They honestly could've reached an agreement and she only ever responded after she was being publicly slandered and threatened. To me at least her statements just sounded like she wanted an apology they fucked up
