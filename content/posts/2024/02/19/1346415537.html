      <p>its international jiwoongs fans saying its a rumor so international fans wont spread the video but u can clearly hear it. honestly the international side is on some propaganda typa shit because theyre saying everything knets says are lies or jw antis and international fans are all falling for it. some international zeroses actually believe its not bad on the kside and believe the only hate is from anti jw but its the entire korean general public and its so fcking bad all of pann, instiz and theqoo is of jiwoong memeing and shitting on him and k twitter getting so many qrts hating on him too.

      <p>international fans are being so annoying about this tbh any time a korean tries to tell them how they feel about it or even just explain the situation, intl fans shut them down and play up their western superiority complex</p>

      <p>They can just say they dgaf like don't act like smth hurtful didn't occur it's more issue because the fan is being threatened and accused without apologyðŸ˜­ I'm still not sure ab the history or the acc but from her responses she seems like an actual fan

      <p>one thing about ifans I've noticed is they demonize kfans so bad jfjrjjjfdkkdkd like they're better or smth like I genuinely don't care and the only thing that bothers me is the groups getting dragged they can just say they dgaf and they'll support him instead of acting like kfans are wrong they're doing tm but it's obvious it's most likely him who said itðŸ˜­
