      <p>Almost all tweets mocking what the article says on that video saying it may or may not be a fan of whatever. It's all hit tweets too. Almost every tweet mocking Zeroses and Jiwoong got 500k views</p>

      <p>Intl fans saying Jiwoong is such a great idol since he doesn't give a fuck and can clearly say he didn't say the word when it just meant it's either Matthew or taerae now in antis mind. Which is also the reason why everyone is mocking Jiwoong lol</p>
