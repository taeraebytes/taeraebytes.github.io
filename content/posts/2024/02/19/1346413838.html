      <p>not sure about internationally anon, there may be some pity stans or people who think he's a bad bitch and join bc of that with the way internationally majority of ppl, both zeroses and non-fans, seem to be on his side and find this all stupid ðŸ˜­ if they have a good cb it might lock in the internationals but yeah i guess there's no proof of it yet, this is all me theorising</p>
