      <p>eh but he didn't even say that he was angry or disliked the AI audios of him, he just said that on his opinion technology will never surpass the feeling of hearing the og songs bc they have more emotion, the topic was just about the evolution of music and how music would be on the future so at the end he added that maybe in the future technology could be used for concerts and stage venues</p>
