      <p>Isn't the statement on Mnet plus talking about hb and gw so idk what they want more :

I think the more promo regarding solo schedule is hard since Mnet is also posting about his schedule so Wakeone just RT it so it's definitely about his OST lmao.

They won't be able to create articles after OST has been released if it actually haven't chart or reached anything good to mention so idk what they want</p>
