      <p>well that baekhyun ai cover has over 1 mil views, so its whatever i guess. those fans that shit on hanbin on weibo are probably more mad about the fact that hanbin kinda "mentioned" baekhyun when the song is sung by taeyeon. they both dated in the past so fans are probably annoyed by that fact rather than him opening an ai cover ðŸ’€</p>
