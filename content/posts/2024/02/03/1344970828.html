      <p>statement is weird af cuz its all one sided, w1 only asked jw and their staff so ofc theyre gonna be biased but didnt reach out to op to clarify to get their side and went straight to "were suing u". usually companies tries to resolve these typa sitch behind close doors so idk why theyre jumping the gun without contacting op. I feel like its a scare tactic + u cant deny the fact that jw was sighing like crazy in the other vid ðŸ˜­</p>
