      <p>Jiwoongs not even on this list. Did he fall off that hard because of his issue or is it because the people that make the list decided to cut his stats out?

Like literally seunghan and Soobin should've been top 1 and 2 idk if it's back in November or December but they weren't and no one else has been that talked about until jiwoong</p>
