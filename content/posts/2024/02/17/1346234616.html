      <p>so from what i understood is that the video by the fan is real but the voice is not jiwoongs but someone that lives with/ around op because op used a separate phone to record the fansign so the voice sounds like its from the fansign if you play it back if that makes sense. so it was malice unless op didnt know their brother, neighbor or dad or w.e was the one sayin ssibal.

so technically op didnt manipulate the video because it was recorded from a seperate phone that caught the audio of the fancall PLUS her surrounding.</p>
