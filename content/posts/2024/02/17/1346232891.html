Technically there's no way to garner negative points if your name is brought up and boosted enough ur points go up no matter if it's good or bad. That's generally how he is supposed to work but the creators can get personal and do whatever they want so it would actually put jiwoong in the top 15 at least but he's not there at all I don't believe wonbin isn't #1 sm creates good buzz and they did promo in an empty house"

      <p>Jiwoongs not even on this list. Did he fall off that hard because of his issue or is it because the people that make the list decided to cut his stats out?
