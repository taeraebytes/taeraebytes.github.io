      <p>oh you wouldn't be interested, there's no tea it's just essays about gender presentation in k-pop and lesbianism. and haobin rpf sdfkdfgj i ignored those parts but one thing relevant to this cc was her + her friend being really annoyed by people who think ricky is feminine and beautiful like a girl or whatever b/c he's not feminine he's just a douyin boy</p>
