      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>You're not that sane either, your cc is evidence enough of that, no one said hanbin should be center and no hao is not miles above hanbin in international popularity yall just want to believe that, and have you asked yourself why zb1 has no magazine covers since ages? And yes one of the reasons zb1 is not doing as well as projected is because of hao, yuehua and his c-fandom.</p>

      <p>What if I told you I was the sanest girl in the world 😳 ok but what were u getting at I'm just using past experiences and encounters this isn't the first time I've gotten a cc like this and almost always they're coming to one conclusion -> hao shouldn't be center and who advocates for that silently 🤔🤔 you know who I'm no rosin nor do I care ab the politics but I'm not dumb😭 believe what u want to believe about success I'm not the success professor😭 and magazines were being complained about by all sides of the fandom I for one am grateful the torture has stopped and again this sounds like more of a personal issue with hao than a fact because nobody has ever said that

      <p>rosin here, i agree with requeefiem.

“hao being center has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick” anon this assumption of yours is so wrong and sinophobic on so many levels. ever since the x1 rigging scandal NO subsequent mnet group has EVER had gp’s support, just look at kep1er. they have a korean center and YET their sole cn member is still more popular than her

having gp’s support is good but that’s all it’ll be at the end of the day— gp. gp may stream their music a couple times but they’re not going to buy their albums. if you’re a kpop stan u know that boy groups mainly rely on a STRONG CORE FANDOM. and guess what, zb1 HAD that. zb1’s debut being so successful was mainly because they had a strong core fandom in the beginning. but now many ppl have left the fandom, and it’s because of reasons like wk1’s treatment of the group, the difference in treatment between zb1’s kr fancon and jp fancon, the scandals involving the KOREAN members— how exactly did u ignore all the issues that’s been happening with jiwoong and gunwook (albeit fake) that trended everywhere AND still somehow find a way to blame the group’s dwindling popularity on a chinese member WHO DID NOTHING and his cfans specifically?? do u know how sinophobic u sound rn?? YOU are no better than the k-woongdeongies who randomly blamed hao for jiwoong’s mistake just because they thought “a korean man wouldn’t curse at a fan so it must be the chinese man!”

and why are u blaming hao for the sinophobia he faces in sk? like it’s his FAULT that koreans are sinophobic?? what is he supposed to do about that when he’s the one being cursed at for being chinese? while it is true that hao and ricky faces terrible sinophobia in kforums, it’s affects more of their solo popularity rather than the the entire group’s popularity. zb1 still has 7 korean members. kforums consist of a very specific population of sk, NOT the gp. in bloom was well-received by gp because it was a bop. crush was noise music and they fell off hard. 

u speak as if if the center was a korean member they’d immediately be popular with the gp??? zb1 has 9 members, only 2 are chinese and 1 of them is the center. if gp truly wanted to stan zb1 but not a chinese member they have 7 other members to choose from. so why do u talk as if the korean members aren’t responsible for attracting new fans? you imply that hao’s ethnicity and his cfans are at fault, but at the same time you put only him responsible for attracting the gp??? and fyi hao’s fans aren’t just cn or sino koreans, many of the comments under his posts have kr fans saying he’s the first ever cn idol they stanned, and they never thought they’d stan a cn idol before. he has ALWAYS pulled his weight in attracting new kr fans. now, what about the korean members u so dearly defend and give a free pass?
