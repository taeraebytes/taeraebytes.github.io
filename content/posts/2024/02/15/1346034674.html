      <p>"when I defend hao they don't like me I don't like y'all eitherðŸ˜’" how are you defending hao when you are critizing people that say hao is experiencing sinophobia in korea and that it can effect the whole groups success?? and to that "rosin" thats saying we are acting like we are korean nationalists... pls go, look and understand the comments under haos posts or articles, or whatver kfans say in twt about him. cause yall are obviously living in your own bubbles</p>

      <p>Just for reference the original anon is not a rosin and doubled down and typed verbatim "zb1 is not doing as well as projected is because of hao, yuehua and his c-fandom". There was no criticism about what the media says and how the media depicts hao and cline in that original cc but that the reason why zb1 will never be a gp pick or that they're never going to reach a certain success is because of hao being center. Basically saying hao shouldn't have been center and his Chinese fandom is ruining the group, this is how I understood it. Like I said multiple times you guys do not have the context thqt I do there are so so sooo many ccs I don't post with so much racist rhetoric and criticisms I usually would not have replied to that cc but I just felt like I needed to generally just say my opinion because the volume of those kinds of ccs has gone up recently. Then we had anons or anon (also said cant tell who is who all the time) backtrack their statement and talk about the media and how we ignore the Sinophobia cline faces from that to take the heat off themselves, but was that what was being talked aboutðŸ¤” never said that didn't happened but are we going to blame one member and his fandom? Again that was never brought up in the original ccs nor did I reference this particular issue. This is really the last thing I'll say about this I'm not going to be made to feel like I did something wrong.
