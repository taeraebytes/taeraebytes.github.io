      <p>i hope we can get a lil gunwook rap verse on this 3rd album.. i think the times in which gunwook has revealed he's been writing were post-crush (could be totally wrong)? so maybe he's had time to contribute to a verse? but idk ðŸ˜­ need it so bad like c'monnnnnnn</p>

      <p>I wish they could get a separate ytb channel or SoundCloud where they drop their songs or covers like honestly we have a lot of creatives in the group Hanbin Gunwook Hao Gyuvin Ricky and Taerae have all said they want to compose or write, I want a full rap track from Gunwook so baddd it's my favorite genre and imo the most versatile in terms of producing and freedom</p>
