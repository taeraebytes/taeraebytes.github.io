      <p>the only reason why allins are dickriding hard for yujin rn is bc they dont see that little boy as a threat ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ and bc they hate hao so everything hao is supposed to get (center position in this instance) getting taken away from him probably got them kicking their feet lmao theyre so pathetic

if yujin was getting called a main dancer theyd have the pitchforks ready in 2 mins</p>
