Actually a LOT of idols would benefit from going back to the foundations of dancing and I think a lot of their issues in technique stem from the fact that idols dont really learn how to dance they just learn how to do the choreos but as we were saying about kpop just being a cash-grab, companies dont give enough of a fuck to actually train their idols in these foundations properly",

      <p>Any thoughts on how gv can improve more? Like we see how hard he practiced his dancing but I can't help but feel awkward to watch him dance. I think its because he's using the dance technique or style for someone that isn't his height kr wtv so he feels awkward for some reason</p>
