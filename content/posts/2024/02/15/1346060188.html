      <p>Ngl it's gonna be real funny if Hao cbar and every Hao fanbase announce album boycott for Korean comeback and then once they saw that Hao will participate in that album, imagine how many albums they're gonna buy 🤣🤣 they'll automatically open links to buy that album we'll probably beat our crush sales lmao</p>
