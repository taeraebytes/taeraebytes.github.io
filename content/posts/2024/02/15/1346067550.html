      <p>with the popularization of kpop i honestly expected all new idols to be super good at dancing/singing and looking like models but somehow they are getting worse each year üò≠ idk like now everybody and there mama wants to be an idol, is it really that hard to find some trainees that have it all esp for big4 companies</p>

      <p>the quality for talent has gone down the variety of visuals has gone down everyone's also rich so the personalities are a lot blander and worse this is why kpop is falling off now

      <p>kpop is like the fast fashion of music they‚Äôre just trying to churn out the most quantity as quickly as possible (that‚Äôs why the music and trend cycles are so damn short) and to do that they don‚Äôt have time or patience to give idols actual training to be good performers and singers especially when most ppl just stan for visuals nowadays</p>

      <p>I've realized how much of a capitalist dystopia Kpop is when I noticed theres like maybe 3 actually GREAT full albums like there's like 1000+ groups  since the 80s how is the level of artistry that weak I could name you 15 great American albums from 2015-2017 alone</p>
