      <p>Kepi had a subunit song last comeback. If zb1 had a subunit song and Wakeone put f4 in 1, imagine the slayage of the 5 members???

Hao Gunwook Taerae Matthew Ricky in one song?? Like you have the vocals, rap and dance. 

Hanbin will carry the other in the way that he's the main vocal, lead vocal, main dancer. And the other 3 are such vocals</p>
