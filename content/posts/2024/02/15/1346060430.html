      <p>i hope we can get a lil gunwook rap verse on this 3rd album.. i think the times in which gunwook has revealed he's been writing were post-crush (could be totally wrong)? so maybe he's had time to contribute to a verse? but idk 😭 need it so bad like c'monnnnnnn</p>

      <p>I wish they could get a separate ytb channel or SoundCloud where they drop their songs or covers like honestly we have a lot of creatives in the group Hanbin Gunwook Hao Gyuvin Ricky and Taerae have all said they want to compose or write, I want a full rap track from Gunwook so baddd it's my favorite genre and imo the most versatile in terms of producing and freedom</p>

      <p>We need something like Hao's so bad cover. Like a different rendition of the song or whatever. I'm also tried of watching them dance since it's all the same people and all the same dance style. 

If it was Taerae posting a dance cover I'll be shocked</p>

      <p>Taerae doing a dance cover would be so interesting, he kind of did that already with the chilli challenge with hao (I'm guessing it was his idea since he kept talking about it on bubble)</p>
