      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>You're not that sane either, your cc is evidence enough of that, no one said hanbin should be center and no hao is not miles above hanbin in international popularity yall just want to believe that, and have you asked yourself why zb1 has no magazine covers since ages? And yes one of the reasons zb1 is not doing as well as projected is because of hao, yuehua and his c-fandom.</p>

      <p>What if I told you I was the sanest girl in the world 😳 ok but what were u getting at I'm just using past experiences and encounters this isn't the first time I've gotten a cc like this and almost always they're coming to one conclusion -> hao shouldn't be center and who advocates for that silently 🤔🤔 you know who I'm no rosin nor do I care ab the politics but I'm not dumb😭 believe what u want to believe about success I'm not the success professor😭 and magazines were being complained about by all sides of the fandom I for one am grateful the torture has stopped and again this sounds like more of a personal issue with hao than a fact because nobody has ever said that

      <p>(2/2)

in the first place, why are u blaming rosins and hao for the group’s popularity?? “rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet” we aren’t the sf who can’t move on from losing in bp and keep spouting bs about “dual center”, we aren’t the sf bullying another member for calling himself “ace/main dancer” either, we aren’t the sf bullying hao for introducing himself as the center, we just want hao (and by extension the rest of the grp too) to be treated right. rosins aren’t the people sending trucks that ruined the fandom’s image, rosins aren’t the ones vandalizing public places with support notes for a korean member currently involved in a scandal that was very badly received by the gp; in fact the gp doesn’t even know who rosins are. in fact, rosins are probably the sf most understanding of the idea that “our bias has a disadvantage when it comes to attracting the gp to become his fan because of sinophobia” so we try our best to become a strong core fandom for him so that he doesn’t need to rely on the gp for his own popularity. but what do the rest of y’all zeroses do? u will blame rosins, u will blame the gp, u will blame anyone BUT yourselves and wk1 for the group’s dwindling popularity. u shun out the one sf capable of making things happen, u blame hao for the group’s popularity over him getting sinophobic hate from kforums BUT AT THE SAME TIME u ignore the sinophobia zhang hao gets from i-allins on a daily basis because “it’s rosin/allin beef anyway” 😀 nobody stood up for rosins when we were all being accused for the trucks (when there was clear proof that it was done by k-antis), in fact many of y’all proudly spouted sinophobic remarks over a mistranslation! but when it was proven to be a mistranslation the entire fandom moved on so quickly like they weren’t wishing d3ath upon chinese ppl a few hrs ago.

when zb1 wins roty the entire fandom celebrates that “it’s all thanks to zeroses’ efforts” but the moment rosins want to boycott the group because of how wk1 treated hao during the covid fansign issue and his solo song y’all blame us saying “rosins’ fault if the group doesn’t win roty”! didn’t y’all say “zb1 has 8 other sfs to support them, we don’t care about rosins”? why is it now suddenly rosins and hao’s fault for the group’s dwindling popularity? what happened to the 8 other sfs? why are rosins solely responsible for the image of the entire fandom?? why do other subfandoms get a free pass even when they cause the gp to have a bad impression of the group and don’t get blamed for not pulling their weight? and most importantly WHY is it that after u see the sinophobia hao and ricky face in kforums, your first thought is: “the chinese center and his cfans are to blame (for being chinese!)” and not “koreans are sinophobic as hell and we need to become a better fandom and protect c-line from them”? think about that.</p>
