      <p>it's kind of scary like it's people I've never heard of or seen constantly talking ab me.. idk how u say u hate someone but speak on them like thisðŸ˜­ plus they're all much much older than me and they say worse behind closed doors I've even had one threaten my friend before I don't have no beef and frankly i find them weird but they won't ever leave me alone
