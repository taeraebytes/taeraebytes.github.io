      <p>Kepi had a subunit song last comeback. If zb1 had a subunit song and Wakeone put f4 in 1, imagine the slayage of the 5 members???

Hao Gunwook Taerae Matthew Ricky in one song?? Like you have the vocals, rap and dance. 

Hanbin will carry the other in the way that he's the main vocal, lead vocal, main dancer. And the other 3 are such vocals</p>

      <p>Oh I really loved the thought of Wakeone maximizing f4 subunit because it means we'll get the 5 in one too and ngl, I would prefer to get a "less popular in Korea" subunit as long as they'll be good</p>

      <p>If Wakeone feels that they need kr support, they might "think" they need f4 again so let's go with this subunit. 

Or wtv I just don't want Hao Taerae and Gunwook to be on a sub unit with jw esp gunwook</p>
