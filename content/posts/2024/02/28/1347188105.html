ngl i thought it was a no brainer wonyoung is pushed but ig not and saw some other chart in the replies wonyoung gets the same amount of solo activities as the rest. yujin and rei got the most which is shocking to me</p>

      <p>Oh I'd be trying to chop off yujins hands if I was a dive but honestly without promo wony is still treated like she has it so giving her smth similar would make people think she's favored when she's not it's a weird paradox

      <p>HELPPP not the charts I thought it was only a crosins vs callin thing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I noticed that too she rarely gets schedules/ tiktoks but when she does she blows up for it so I guess it seems like she gets a lot of gigs and shes the most well known outside their fandom so that too can lead to that favored paradox. The biggest dive hypocorism is when wy would be mc and her dress would be extra because uh she's the mc and their fans would complain saying starship favors her then when yj is mc and gets a fancy extra dress the entire fandom is quiet. i feel like they have a lot of ot5 stans my poor girlie that i dont even stan</p>
