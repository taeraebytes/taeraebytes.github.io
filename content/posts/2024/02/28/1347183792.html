      <p>OOP- I thought it was recent LMAOOO I thought it was about hariboz going to shanghai cuz I still don't know why they're going there and I heard rumors about a haobin schedule in HongKong or something so thought it was about either one of those two. Sorry xHugsxKissesx</p>

      <p>The Hariboz in HK I saw on Weibo people saying people from mainland China need a special entry permit to enter Hong Kong, Iâ€™m guessing because itâ€™s a special administrative state and not technically part of China, so Hariboz are probably going there for that.</p>

      <p>Oh I mean Hariboz are probably going to Shanghai to get the entry permit because they are flying from their straight to Tokyo and then thereâ€™s less than a week between jp debut and Kcon HK so thatâ€™s not enough time to get the permit which is why they are flying out before jp debut.</p>
