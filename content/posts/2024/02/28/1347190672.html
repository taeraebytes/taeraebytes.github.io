      <p>He needs to stop doing dance challanges with hanbin seriously, heâ€™s my bias so I donâ€™t want anyone to misunderstand but even if gyuvin executes all the moves thereâ€™s always going to be that skill gap thatâ€™s going to make him look like the â€˜worseâ€™ dancer even though heâ€™s not a bad dancer ðŸ˜­ and like you hinted heâ€™s doing the most challanges with hao and hanbin can he please do more with others</p>
