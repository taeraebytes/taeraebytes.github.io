ngl i thought it was a no brainer wonyoung is pushed but ig not and saw some other chart in the replies wonyoung gets the same amount of solo activities as the rest. yujin and rei got the most which is shocking to me</p>

      <p>Oh I'd be trying to chop off yujins hands if I was a dive but honestly without promo wony is still treated like she has it so giving her smth similar would make people think she's favored when she's not it's a weird paradox

      <p>Because she is more approachable, Wonyoung doesn't have the face to sell beer or soju or cheap snacks. She looks more luxurious, while Yujin is more next door girl type of pretty, so she bags CFs more easily. Plus Yujin has a popular variety show aka Earth Arcade on her resume while Wonyoung just wasn't made for variety.</p>
