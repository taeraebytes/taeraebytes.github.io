      <p>seunghwan head too big funny teeth too beg but I would take my baby over jiwoong IN A HEART BEAT Kamden works for some reason his visuals are liked even tho I think he's cute in a funny way plus he's tall and we'd gain a rapper so gunwook can finally shine and you'd have to kill me first for a seungeon in zb1🤷‍♀️
