      <p>after today's dance live, I realized dieting and idol dancing are ruining hanbin's dance style, predebut unholy 2022 still remains superior</p>

      <p>another anon and i agree. its either that dancing to idol dances made him more stiff or he didnt have alot of time dancing to songs with his own style. its different when you memorize a song and try to recreate it one year after, even if you practiced it one day before. i feel like both things (dancing to only idol songs and having no time for other dances) effected his dancing.</p>

      <p>Not the same anon but people posted side by side comparisons and he dances it exactly the same if even argue his moves in his hips ect hold more fluidity now. Also take into account he wasn’t going as full out as he does in those video’s because evertime he started to dance with more power the phone kept falling.</p>

      <p>Someone sent the comparison in and I posted it already and in my humble opinion I can see a diff between the two vids there's a lack of fluidity in the new version there's a lot of things that could factor into the diff but it's rlly not that big a deal it's not like he botched it he's aight I had one too many anons lose it over this😭😭😭😭😭
