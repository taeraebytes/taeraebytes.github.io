      <p>OOP- I thought it was recent LMAOOO I thought it was about hariboz going to shanghai cuz I still don't know why they're going there and I heard rumors about a haobin schedule in HongKong or something so thought it was about either one of those two. Sorry xHugsxKissesx</p>

      <p>they're going to shanghai for special entries and for the flight connections apparently but send the links to the rumors I'd like to see and another brand event when they're starting their promos again just doesn't seem likely to me and there's no way haobin are being sent to hk for a sched ðŸ˜­
