      <p>idols have skewed ppls perceptions of koreans. beyond them all getting ps to get rid of their ethnic features to the point where kpop stans don’t know what koreans look like and believe they’re all natural, they also are hyper aware of their appearances all the time like it’s quite literally their job to look perfect (meanwhile the managers’ jobs r to manage the groups not look good for the camera). idols r super strict abt their diets and skin, they probably see all sorts of specialists to maintain them and take a bunch of supplements and what not. they have professional stylists to make them look good on stage & for the cameras & public appearances. celebrities in general look nothing like the average person</p>
