 can jiwoong leave? like seriously. he is dragging the groups name, AGAIN. this is not going to stop unless he leaves or is put on a hiatus. i really dont know why wakeone didnt put him on a hiatus once these news came out. if they did that he couldve been at least there for the korean comeback</p>
