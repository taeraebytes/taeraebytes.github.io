      <p>Did u hear about that tempest guy at a club? I think he was at a fansign and the fan was like I saw you at the club and he was like really? Don't worry I didn't do one night stands and then name dropped 5 other idols he went with to the club with ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ 

He was like oh I went to the club with x from yz this one time and another time I went with a from bc. Like he just ratted out his friends like that to save his ass to make it seem like he didn't go alone to go get girls and that by going with other idols it proves he didn't do one night stands.</p>
