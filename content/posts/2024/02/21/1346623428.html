      <p>it's not because "it looked sloppy" it's because kfans hate male idols "more feminine" that's it and if anything he's doing quite well in gg choreos lol most male idols are too stiff and try to make the choreo more masculine and he didn't</p>

      <p>Yea he looked feminine but it's partly cuz he looked sloppy and in turn he just looked more feminine I don't think he would've got jumped as hard if he could dance but taeraes rep has been going down steadily for months anyways it's not just that

      <p>Icb this is this the hill you wanna die on he gets dragged but it's never weekly and it's usually the same 5 trolls everyone got tired of I'd honestly take that because he still has his super strong fanbase, but taerae on the other hand has been on a steady decline because of his super shitty styling his hair and makeup is terrible beyond words the contrasting image the disconnect from the group his proximity to evnne I could go on he's solidified his status as one of the unpopular members with a small fanbase that even trolls don't troll stan. I would know cuz it's not very hard to see and I don't have to find out myself when anons basically update me on everything ðŸ˜­
