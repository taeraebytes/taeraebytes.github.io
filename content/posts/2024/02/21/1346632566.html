      <p>it's not because "it looked sloppy" it's because kfans hate male idols "more feminine" that's it and if anything he's doing quite well in gg choreos lol most male idols are too stiff and try to make the choreo more masculine and he didn't</p>

      <p>Yea he looked feminine but it's partly cuz he looked sloppy and in turn he just looked more feminine I don't think he would've got jumped as hard if he could dance but taeraes rep has been going down steadily for months anyways it's not just that

      <p>Icb this is this the hill you wanna die on he gets dragged but it's never weekly and it's usually the same 5 trolls everyone got tired of I'd honestly take that because he still has his super strong fanbase, but taerae on the other hand has been on a steady decline because of his super shitty styling his hair and makeup is terrible beyond words the contrasting image the disconnect from the group his proximity to evnne I could go on he's solidified his status as one of the unpopular members with a small fanbase that even trolls don't troll stan. I would know cuz it's not very hard to see and I don't have to find out myself when anons basically update me on everything ðŸ˜­

      <p>anon youâ€™re just mad asfk for no reason because this is just a fact even yesterday his kfans were mad at him for dancing to superlady and acting feminine and saying he should go back to his church oppa image and act like an idol or whatever he used to be one of the most famous members (in sk) and now i wouldnâ€™t even say he is top 5â€¦ none of it is his fault since heâ€™s being himself but so many kfans hate how he acts bc this isnâ€™t how he was shown in bp</p>

      <p>i don't really care what people here say about him as long as it isn't disrespecting him as a person but i want to clear some things up. he is one of the least popular but it was one kfan who said something and they have been threatening to leave for months already so nobody even takes them serious kfans had already ratioed them when ifans found out about it. the other tweets were from trolls likely homophobic because some of them had never tweeted about zb1 before and only commented on the video. the most attention i saw on any tweet was from one of the trolls that hates half the group (F4 fan) and it got 40 likes while still being ratioed lmao. it was not that serious most of his kfans will ignore it or call him cute/funny and keep it moving. the ones who actually hated it already left a while ago when they first realized he isn't the church oppa they painted him as. but there are fans who want him to stop because he did like multiple funny tiktoks in a row and they don't want him to be seen as a joke which i think some ifans misunderstood as hate when it wasn't. the actual issue kfans have is his hair they only want it black and the company dgaf but he said he should be able to dye it back after japan debut so it's fine they're chilling now. my priv mutual tweeted about it so you may get some more i have been here for a while but didn't know you reactivated after the last callout so thats how i found out</p>
