      <p>Yuehua? Can't find it too so they could've deleted it? 

If he switched to yuehua, yuehua might have a chance to make it big with their group after disbandment.</p>

      <p>I think it's in Japan? I don't know if it's their recent trip or back in Kcon Japan but all the signs are in Japanese. But if I were to guess I think it's kcon Japan based on the fact that there's guards with them and their recent trip they went alone with one manager.</p>
