      <p>no offense bc i would rather ricky not be an idol at all then him being purposefully mistreated. him living a normal rich live is definitely better than living with 7 other guys in a country whose language he fully doesn't know, being micromanaged and making 0 money off of it 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>jdjrjfkdkkdkdkd you guys act like Ricky was kidnapped he willingly came to this country to chase a dream and debuted with his best friend it's unfortunate how things are going but he chose to be an idol. Not saying he doesn't get mistreated but now it's baseless complaints drowning everything out like the state of his hair or smth😭

      <p>yes he chose to be an idol, NOT this. he is literally not being an idol right now. do you not understand? he doesn't have any jobs AT ALL. and he never did. i highly doubt ricky spend 3 years of his life training just to be benched for 2 years of his entire career. acting like by choosing this career his fans who, btw the ones who made him debut bc we wanted to see more of him, can't complain. being abused and mistreated isn't a requirement to being an idol. u sound dumb af rn 🤕</p>
