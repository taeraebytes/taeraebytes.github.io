      <p>I wouldn’t say the other companies dgaf about their members more that yh clearly has an upper hand with 4 of their trainees in the group. It’s not something that’s does not with any of the produce of planet groups have the original companies allowed to be involved like this. I mean look at what happened with the jellyfish girls in ioi. Since then it’s been clear that once they are in the group there is very minimal involvement from their original companies</p>

      <p>Yea the only reason we're seeing this much from them is cuz they got half the group. But I still think they shouldn't have a yuehua manager esp since he's the one who yelled at Ricky I get having other kinds of staff but managers should be left to wakeone imo but I think yh is more involved in staffing just cuz wakeone probably has a total of 7
