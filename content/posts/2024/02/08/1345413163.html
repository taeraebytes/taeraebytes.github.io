      <p>considering zeroses can't stop fantasising about zb1's disbandment and may as well be counting down the days like they're 13 year olds going to their first concert i think it's payback to y'all ngl</p>

      <p>no offense bc i would rather ricky not be an idol at all then him being purposefully mistreated. him living a normal rich live is definitely better than living with 7 other guys in a country whose language he fully doesn't know, being micromanaged and making 0 money off of it 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>jdjrjfkdkkdkdkd you guys act like Ricky was kidnapped he willingly came to this country to chase a dream and debuted with his best friend it's unfortunate how things are going but he chose to be an idol. Not saying he doesn't get mistreated but now it's baseless complaints drowning everything out like the state of his hair or smth😭
