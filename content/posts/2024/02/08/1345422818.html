      <p>am I the only one feeling sad for the truck driver ðŸ˜¢ apparently he was an older man and that was prob the only job he can get that isn't physical labor and now he prob got yelled at for being naive giving his phone to jammins and them leaking the customer info breaking company trust where the company had to put out a statement. Also the truck driver wasnt even the one who was making the deal the only reason why he has the customer kkt is to send videos of the trucks being in front of their destination aka transaction complete. hope he didnt get sacked</p>
