      <p>considering zeroses can't stop fantasising about zb1's disbandment and may as well be counting down the days like they're 13 year olds going to their first concert i think it's payback to y'all ngl</p>

      <p>no offense bc i would rather ricky not be an idol at all then him being purposefully mistreated. him living a normal rich live is definitely better than living with 7 other guys in a country whose language he fully doesn't know, being micromanaged and making 0 money off of it 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>jdjrjfkdkkdkdkd you guys act like Ricky was kidnapped he willingly came to this country to chase a dream and debuted with his best friend it's unfortunate how things are going but he chose to be an idol. Not saying he doesn't get mistreated but now it's baseless complaints drowning everything out like the state of his hair or smth😭

      <p>yes he chose to be an idol, NOT this. he is literally not being an idol right now. do you not understand? he doesn't have any jobs AT ALL. and he never did. i highly doubt ricky spend 3 years of his life training just to be benched for 2 years of his entire career. acting like by choosing this career his fans who, btw the ones who made him debut bc we wanted to see more of him, can't complain. being abused and mistreated isn't a requirement to being an idol. u sound dumb af rn 🤕</p>

      <p>do you know how many non-group job he has gotten since debut? around 6 or 7 and most of these are from in bloom era. he is also the member that has the least posts in every social media and by a big margin. so yeah im sorry ig i can't say "he never had a job" because hey! he went to baby cloud 5 months ago (and never came back even tho the members to come back were chosed by children and he only one who was chosed but didn't appear) MY BAD 😔 i shouldn't complain ricky is so blessed to be in zb1 and spending his time sitting in korea. that was his dream job, he chose it so he should take it whatever he likes it or not right?</p>

      <p>Ok I get that but people do need to recognize the change and that's it's possible for another switch 6 or 7 is good for one era I had gunwook injured 12s lines 1 90s schedule during in bloom like😭😭😭😭😭 and bubble didn't even exist. it seems like they switched lowkey except for the lines cuz Ricky still has more I'm just saying these people are lowkey depressing themselves and making it sound kind of worse than it is like to actually go as far to believe there's behind the doors abuse and targeted sabotage would literally make u suicidal when most likely that's not happening so y'all gotta put that doom perc down and realize this is a hiatus and literally anything can happen cheer up

      <p>u really think ricky isn't getting sabotaged? lol friendly reminder that he is the only member of zb1 who was never meant to debut. his own company didn't want him to debut. his debut is entirely based on luck his or video getting viral and his fans being dedicated af. despite being benched he's still one of the most popular members in the group and a king of sns. if wakeone send him to film more tiktoks with other idols instead of sending fucking yujin who gets himself dragged everytime he botches other idols' songs, zb1 would've been in a better position. it's that easy. we know it, ricky knows it and wakeone definitely fucking knows this yet they don't do it (and don't tell me that ricky himself doesn't post when we know damn well how micromanaged they're when it comes to official sns)</p>

      <p>taerae wasn't meant to either.... there's a difference when u guys say sabotage because you act like wakeone holds meetings every week to discuss what evil deed they're gonna commit towards Ricky when it's a mixture of a shitty company incompetence extreme lack of staff and probably some yuehua involvement which you could say is a form of it but thats not what a lot riyangis are getting at. Yuehua not deeming Ricky marketable is simply just that they sent out like what 5-6 trainees and put their money on who they put their money on it's really nothing more nothing less. And tiktoks would not put zb1 in a better position that's not what's fucking them up it would make probably no difference😭. Social media is where ricky reigns but they don't even have a team for socials and they just recruited someone to respond to fan issues, it's obv he's not seen as valuable as others that's probably partly due to his own company people do not realize how involved yuehua is and they're notorious for being shitty. No shade wakeone isn't gonna listen to riyangis they're gonna listen to rukidans and they've done a better job at listening to them and the only reason the manager issue went how it did is because rukidans realized they targeted and doxxed the wrong manager so they let the issue go
