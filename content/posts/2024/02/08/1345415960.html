      <p>i dont understand this point that zerose are ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù of fantasise about d-day, its a normal response to knowing something you like will be taken away from you soon kinda like when you‚Äôre out having a good time or on holiday and you get reminded it will be over soon, why do ppl act like its a fetish like let ppl be upset if anything it just shows they care about the group a lot</p>

      <p>I mean it is an obsession every other day it's like oh but they'll be gone in 2 yrs and depress themselves and a large chunk of people doing actual countdowns that's doing nothing but make the next 2 yrs miserable for them like have y'all seen Kepler fans countdown noüò≠ and they got it worse
