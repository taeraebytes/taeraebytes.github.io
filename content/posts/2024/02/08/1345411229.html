      <p>lol all zb1 does for ricky is wasting his time. he isn't getting any jobs, he isn't getting paid, he's a part of the group but we can't see him 98% of the time. he's only called for group performances to sing his 10s lines once a month. what's the difference between now and if he never debuted? not much. we probably would've seen him the same if not more often and he was would've looked better as there would be no wk1 stylist fucking up his face. i know he definitely would've be happier home with his family instead of sitting in their shitty dorms 24/7 while his teammates get into controversies and get him dragged</p>

      <p>ok hmmm how do I say this.... crush era was shit for Ricky yes in bloom he was fine and doing better than some members schedule wise I feel like everyone forgets that. After crush era is award season then boom hiatus which btw for someone who's not in dance like he got a solo and duo stage. The social media thing is an issue but with a company like this you can't be that surprised and it's obvious with their extreme staffing issue and history of incompetence. The manager issue was something not even done by a wakeone employee. Bubble is now debatable, and whether or not things are damage control they're there and it's a sign that at least some outrage is taken serious. And you say 10s lines so lightly LIKE THERE AINT PPL IN THE GROUP WITH 5S😭😭😭😭😭 baby you will be ok zb1 are in an extreme drought era and company employee turn over like please calm down and you act like Ricky getting dragged because of his other members is EXCLUSIVE... WHEN ITS NOT LIKE ARE U CRAZY GUNWOOK HAS BEEN GETTINF DRAGGED 10 FOLD if you want it to bad let's switch😂 you guys are having a terrible few months I feel yall but things rlly can change clearly because riyangis are experiencing some type of memory loss and acting like Ricky wasn't lit predebut and in bloom era so who says things can't get better I'm so tired of the misdirected complaining like do y'all not get tired gyatdamnnnnnnnn.
