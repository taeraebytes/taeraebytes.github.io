      <p>nah allindans stan gyuvin because he’s the “only nice person to hanbin” (which is just a flat out lie because all the members love him) and they only care about gyuvin in the context of hanbin, they don’t give a fuck about him as a person. they just need someone to have duo interactions with and hao is their rival, matthew is “too ugly”, taerae and hanbin aren’t that close, same with ricky, i have no idea why they hate gunwook but probably because geonppangdans call gunwook a main dancer and they tweak out any time they hear that. they like yujin and jiwoong marginally because of f4 but once again never outside of the context of what they are doing for hanbin. them liking idols is just incredibly transactional, the only reason they like the mcd trio is because hanbin is treated as the center of attention if anyone else was they would probably hate them too</p>
