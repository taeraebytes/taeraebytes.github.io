      <p>they all talk like that specific brand of armys who try to seem all big and bad and 'clapback' (the ones who talk about antis 'barking', call ppl 'kpoopies' and then use the worst grammar known to man like omg let's expand our vocabulary a bit) so i theorise that some of those migrated to watching boys planet during bts' hiatus. i'm lowkey the same bc i was bored as shit so i can't really judge but it's the way they act and word things booooooo</p>
