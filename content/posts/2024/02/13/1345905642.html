      <p>Ok but they did spill though. New groups charting higher and crush era never even hit higher than in bloom. We only have sales as our edge because streaming team can't stream shit.</p>

      <p>icl i got proud of zb1 theres a lot of ppl making fun of tws charts saying can they even sell out gocheok (their fandom outside of viral tweets is actually miniscule) meanwhile zb1 did it a month from debut ,, i hope they go back again soon i defo think it would sell out and it will prove antis who bark about zb1 losing fans wrong</p>

      <p>Genuinely wondering if that tws song is viral anywhere for them to be rising on all charts? They obviously don't having a huge fandom streaming (since they lost to evnne on voting for music shows) and shinyu and dohoon don't seem to be getting the level of hype that wonbin got for their visuals so where's the interest coming from?</p>

      <p>No it's so so sooo blatantly fake they're getting dragged now even my friends who argued w me about the manipulation are calling it crazy they're not even trying to be discreetüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ they don't have no hype outside of the song rising

      <p>where‚Äôs the virality ppl are talking about its translating to fan interest at all, cause the popular members average similar to bnd and evnne numbers üò≠ bgs can have amazing visuals but it doesnt translate to success look at astro</p>

      <p>that song impact wise didn't touch antifragile or unforgiven and it was an English release and aespa drama was blowing up AND it was a full house like hybe greed knows no bounds they always do this for their artists like there's nothing natural ab that company

      <p>I don't even like aespa or lsf like that but Perfect Night is so fucking catchy, even better than drama. Perfect night feels as if newjeans started releasing long songs again and not the music snippets they have been trying to sell as songs.</p>
