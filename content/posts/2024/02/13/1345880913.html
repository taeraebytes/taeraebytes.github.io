      <p>Ok but they did spill though. New groups charting higher and crush era never even hit higher than in bloom. We only have sales as our edge because streaming team can't stream shit.</p>

      <p>icl i got proud of zb1 theres a lot of ppl making fun of tws charts saying can they even sell out gocheok (their fandom outside of viral tweets is actually miniscule) meanwhile zb1 did it a month from debut ,, i hope they go back again soon i defo think it would sell out and it will prove antis who bark about zb1 losing fans wrong</p>

      <p>Genuinely wondering if that tws song is viral anywhere for them to be rising on all charts? They obviously don't having a huge fandom streaming (since they lost to evnne on voting for music shows) and shinyu and dohoon don't seem to be getting the level of hype that wonbin got for their visuals so where's the interest coming from?</p>

      <p>No it's so so sooo blatantly fake they're getting dragged now even my friends who argued w me about the manipulation are calling it crazy they're not even trying to be discreetüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ they don't have no hype outside of the song rising

      <p>i've heard that there's quite a few big youtube shorts of tws on the korean side and that teenagers like them but like to me it doesn't make sense to translate in the way it has in the way it's charting üßê also ppl were saying the visual pann/general forum posts about them seemed forced but idk i don't really have opinions on that. i don't think it's a wildly unpopular song or anything bc i do think it's pretty well liked but all top 10 or wherever it's at on the charts is kinda crazy. lowkey tho this is making zb1 look organic as hellllllll (not to say they're fake but like their charting makes sense)</p>

      <p>Big YouTube shorts will neeeever translate to an ALMOST PAK LIKE THIS IS UNHEARD OF they have virtually no fandom and they don't even have a fraction of the hype it's rlly not blowing up that hard besides there's real time footage of the manipulation

      <p>It's too obvious if they kept it in the #20s they'd be fine and it's closer to being believable since it's not much of a full house esp no fandom and the song is lowkey on a downwards trend w all the sajaegi

      <p>That song has surpassed Taeyeon's song and is now blocking IU's song from getting PAKs/RAKs in some platforms and those two are one of the biggest artists in that country so TWS is on the same level now? üòÇ</p>
