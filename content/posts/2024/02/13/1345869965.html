      <p>Ok but they did spill though. New groups charting higher and crush era never even hit higher than in bloom. We only have sales as our edge because streaming team can't stream shit.</p>

      <p>icl i got proud of zb1 theres a lot of ppl making fun of tws charts saying can they even sell out gocheok (their fandom outside of viral tweets is actually miniscule) meanwhile zb1 did it a month from debut ,, i hope they go back again soon i defo think it would sell out and it will prove antis who bark about zb1 losing fans wrong</p>
