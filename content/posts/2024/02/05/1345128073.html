      <p>diff anon here i'm thinking maybe she trauma-dumped on him and he really wasn't having it so he cursed after the fancall when he thought the call had ended? it's strange because this guessing-game of who's in the wrong can just end had she just posted the rest of the fancall to let us judge whether his response is acceptable given the context of what they talked about but she refuses to show us the rest of the call so either 1) she's a liar and it's edited or she said something hateful to him which led to that response or 2) she talked about a very personal topic like a trauma and doesn't want to share it to the masses. if she really was trauma-dumping then i can't blame him tho it's not his job to be a psychiatrist for his fan. but until we see the rest of the call i'm remaining neutral idk</p>

      <p>I don't rlly think the full call really changes anything unless she was being extremely over and out of bounds which I don't think happened. She seemed normal saod normal things maybe she did trauma dump but his attitude the whole time was sour. It's really all just about his attitude towards the work and letting that slip happen in front of her and she rlly did sound so depressed. The issue is that and the fact that hundreds of idols exists that have worse day worse demands and they never let the facade drop its more about him being incompetent and disrespectful cuz I don't rlly care about what he did

      <p>Yall gotta quit with the wishful thinking and accept that youâ€™re idol is an asshole no shade because for 1 wk1 is strict they wouldnâ€™t even allow her to trauma dump if she did and 2 they wouldnâ€™t have enough time for all of that in a fancall</p>

      <p>as someone who is unbiased and not a zerose or a solo stan of any member, i feel like the group is better off as 8. jiwoong is an outlier in terms of age (ik technically yujin is too) and he least suits their concepts. heâ€™s also kinda made me uncomfy since bp and whenever i see clips of him interacting w the members it just feels so awkward or likeâ€¦ tense?? also not a fan of his tone and heâ€™s one of the least skilled technically in both vocals and dance alongside gyuvin. most of the others have at least one that they're good at (dance: yujin, matthew, gunwook; vocals: taerae, ricky; both: hao, hanbin) idk im not a stan so i just observe from afar but jiwoong was the main thing that put me off from wanting to get into the group originally. obviously now there r a lot more factors turning me off but i feel like id be more warm to the group if he hadnt been in the lineup</p>

      <p>wow I'm rlly an annoying fan jrnengjfndmd I just froze please respect my all rounder king but yea jiwoong 100% is the outlier and I felt it since day 1 I'm sorry I could never bring myself to truly like him I could tolerate and be neutral but with the terrible tone and glaringly obvious issues with his dance and no improvement... I can't... plus the fact that I just find him weird with his interactions even on bp I just knew he wasn't serious
