      <p>ella canâ€™t sing for shit bailey probably canâ€™t either and highly doubt annie is trained in anything either a lot of ppl used to say bp was just a group of influences but these girls are legit just gonna be a group of influencers like who is fucking singing</p>

      <p>It's crazy because I remember bailey from her project 21 days. I guess singing has more money in it than dance does. It reminds me of tate mcrae who is also a contemporary dance prodigy, couldn't sing but pivoted and is somehow charting top 3 on billboard now ðŸ˜­</p>
