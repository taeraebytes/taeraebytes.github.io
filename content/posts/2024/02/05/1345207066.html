      <p>so uhhhhh do we have any indicator of how this scandal is gonna affect zb1? like the gp already wasn't tuning in that much and this scandal is out there, wakeone's response hasn't helped and idk what the current fandom (korean side) landscape is like other than ppl constantly being annoyed at the company bc idk, from the stuff i've seen it seems more ot9 over there or maybe ppl are just less in ur face about being a solo stan/akgae ðŸ˜­ i just don't want them to go on a downward trajectory and the new bgs getting bigger is annoying me a little i can't lie.. like my poor meow meows</p>

      <p>Well it's gonna give the group a bad image because he's a member but nobody's blaming the other 8 which is good I'm ngl the attention is good from a marketing view it's just negative if it's handled better in the future it would lead to more traction
