    "reply": "buy time for a final response ngl if wakeone was responding timely things would get worse cuz they're going to say the wrong things like they've already done. They're gonna gauge because at the end of the day the companies are gonna choose their artists to SOME extent and would say amth in their favor do u think any company would just oust their idol even if they were hella wrong. So far they've dropped something about legal action in context of gunwook and hanbin but it was meant for the girl who posted then the statement about jiwoong saying no then forensics for verification, they're probably realizing this isn't something that's not gonna die down and it's gonna get worse idk. The forensics is just a cover so less people demand for an update I think they said they're gonna sue after(?) but the video hasn't been \"concluded\" ok lowkey I'm not getting the words out but their og plan was to wait it out"
