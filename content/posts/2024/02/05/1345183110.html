      <p>well the people that are gonna send trucks to get jiwoong out of the group are using their money pretty loosely cause wakeone will not throw him out of the group just because of some trucks ðŸ˜‚ its not as easy as that to get someone out of a group. if wakeones forensics results come in and they are saying "the video is real" maybe then we can talk about getting him out</p>
