      <p>I don't really know Matt as well as the other 5 so it was harder lol also I copypasted when something was already said for another member sorry 
Part 1

Sun in Gemini, Moon in Capricorn 
Nobody in the astro community fucks with cap moons but I do!! At least in theory cause idk any irl might be why I'm their only defender
The cap moon makes him a more serious Gemini, more calm and ambitious, and when he has goals he's probably really determined and won't shy away from challenges 
He might struggle to open up even if he feels a lot (cancer stellium) he might seem a bit detached and impersonal, probably great at negotiating and is probably very fair
Might have a manipulative streak, or is a great manipulator
Probably over analyze and obsess over things a lot
Definitely smart and charming, probably extraverted

Conj sun mercury; very opiniated n independent, might struggle to hear out other opinions tho, highly expressive, needs to feel heard ab his opinions n ideas, doesn't like to be taught things n really prefers to figure things out by himself, very curious, witty, n intelligent, makes things deeper than they need to be, great communicator 

Conj sun Saturn: he's very grounded, probably has deep insecurities and self esteem issues even if it's hidden by a facade, his dad might have been insecure himself or he might have been criticized or felt pressured by him a lot, might have been lots of restrictions in his life,has a lot of responsibilities and burden, needs to rlly accept and own his ambitious side and build a better life for him 

Trine sun Neptune: dreamy and sensitive, natural love for the arts and music, high morality, honest and eager to help, has a go w the flow attitude which makes him well liked, sensitive when it comes to his ego 

Moon opp venus: tough placement in love might struggle to understand his feelings and might struggle to show affection even when he loves deeply, he can be either super detached or super clingy in relationship but I'll go w detached, he actually is very caring and loving underneath tho, might fear rejection or take rejection badly, partner might be confused by him
He might have a strong need for approval and attention, esp if he feels unloved which might get him into some toxic rs
This is all similar to zh's square I didn't know enough about this aspect back the'

Moon opp mars: super competitive and really needs to win, wants to be a leader, might be irrational and aggressiveness sometimes just bcs he doesn't want to submit can be very impatient, restless and easily frustrated but he's also super passionate, this is another aspect showing a potential tense rs w the parents I haven't said it for everything but yeah that surprised me
Might be hyperactive

Moon sq Lilith : can get obsessional and overtaken by his emotions at times, his moon being in cap might dull this a bit
Again there might be some troubles w his parents esp the mother and a difficulty expressing his feelings</p>
