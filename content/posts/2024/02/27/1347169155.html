      <p>idk why he feels like he has to tone down for his dancing now he's an idol, I guess it's a personal thing but look at idols like shotaro when it's time to dance he goes FULL out</p>

      <p>shotaros dancing background gives him a one up hanbin is barely mediocre at things shotaro excels at and because hiphop is ingrained riize choreo he shines + fierce facial expressions is what hanbins accustomed to he hasnt been an idol long so hell pull those out of habit so yea if hes thinking of his face while dancing hell be distracted
