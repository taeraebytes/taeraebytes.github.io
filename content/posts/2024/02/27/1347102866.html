      <p>wait apparently they first met each other jan 14 at a fashion show and already got exposed???? I wonder if they knew of each other before jan 14 and were friends/ fans of each other and started dating or jan 14 was their very first encounter</p>

      <p>ok so i really enjoy fashion kdramas and was getting into aespa at the time so i saw a loooooot of footage from that event (partly because i follow a bunch of fashion accounts that also cover the events) and basically my opinion from watching all that footage + what we have now. this is my conclusion:

jaewook probably had a crush on karina or find her pretty so at the event he started courting her you can see that in the videos he was taking care of her all the time, helping her and guiding her, etc. like he was treating her really well... karina probably noticed that he kinda liked her and with the way he treated her she probably got interested too, i am guessing that later the two of them arrived to KR and he probably invited her to some dates, she agreed and then they started dating.</p>
