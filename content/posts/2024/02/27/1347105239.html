      <p>well yes but winrina got an even bigger push than haobin gets from sm, they got winrina doing all the couple trends and there's even footage of karina hugging another member until she noticed a fan was filming them and then she went to hug winter like hello??? also karina fans swore to god she was a lesbian.

but anyways i don't have to worry about zb1 flopping bc there's no one more fame and money hungry than haobin</p>
