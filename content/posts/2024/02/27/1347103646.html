      <p>The brand event is for Loewe ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ this is crazy. I really thought Yujin got the bag for that barrie brand since he's the only one who got the solo brand event</p>

      <p>Sofia coppale Gucci and Loewe invite who they want w1 isnâ€™t really having an influence on who they invite. If Yujin went itâ€™s because they wanted him there.</p>

      <p>You really underestimate wakeones choice in things but also for brand events it's pretty uncommon members are requested or the company can't add or subtract + wakeones very particular ab what they allow they even cancelled that event that already got leakedðŸ˜­
