      <p>another anon and i agree. its either that dancing to idol dances made him more stiff or he didnt have alot of time dancing to songs with his own style. its different when you memorize a song and try to recreate it one year after, even if you practiced it one day before. i feel like both things (dancing to only idol songs and having no time for other dances) effected his dancing.</p>
