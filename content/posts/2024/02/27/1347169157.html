Mars in cancer
Not confortable w anger so he might be passive aggressive, self defensive and takes things personally, hates being or feeling like he is criticized, moody, dramatic, holds grudges 
Fear rejection and might not make a move unless he's sure he's being accepted 
Sex is very much tied to emotions, he might use it as reassurance that he is wanted, there's always some emotions involved in sex for him, sex is deeper than fun for him, sex and love goes hand in hand
He will mother his so a lot, really enjoys caring for ppl, he is very kind and gentle 
Indifference is worse than hate to him
Usually trad monogamous lovers but might need to sleep around to feel wanted if he's undeveloped and or insecure 

Trn mars Uranus
Can't change himself n doesn't want to, very unique 
Lots of energy and lots of ideas but but prob doesn't see these ideas through, again w his lack of commitment 
Restless n unpredictable 
Energetic, innovative, independent

Mars square Lilith 
Astruggle to express sexuality, can appear to be intense and aggressive sexually</p>
