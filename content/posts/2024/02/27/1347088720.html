      <p>he ended him in singing bitch don't even try it the weight of that chin barely allows for him to open his mouth and all he can let out are some high pitched squeaks edited to hell in post production to pass off as "singing" clearly the microplastics in his blood stream from all that work have somehow transferred into ur brain and it kills me that everyone tries to drag gunwook for being "fat" like he hasn't been lean his whole life it's been ages since y'all have seen a real man huh
