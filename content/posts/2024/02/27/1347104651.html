      <p>the gag is that kpop fans believe that anyone is gay. the only idols i am confident about are

Zhang Hao, Woongki, Soobin, Chanhee gays.

Hanbin (zb1), Kibum (don't kill me shinee fans), The Boyz Changmin are bisexual leaning towards men tho.

Seola and Moonbyul lesbians.


The other ones are straight to my eyes for now.</p>

      <p>yup i am pretty confident on my gaydar

i still have my doubts about soobin being bi and not gay, and about hanbin being gay and not bi bc there's some things that make me doubt like the videos of him slapping his girl friends asses like idk i feel like if he was bi they wouldn't be fine with him doing that and on the video they didn't care but i remember someone saying that a lot of koreans don't even believe about bisexuality at all so maybe they saw him fanning about men so they were like yeah no he's gay so they were fine with him doing that.

but for now i keep my list like this.</p>
