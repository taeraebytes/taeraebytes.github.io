      <p>The reason why Gyuvin doesn't try to push his relationship with Taerae is because Taerae's popularity is getting low and lower. If Taeraes popularity was higher, trust that Gyuvin would be his bestie ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>Gunwook is also roomies with Hao and the fact that Hao has only ever mentioned gunwook and Taerae (idk if he mentioned others but I remember this two) means everything to me lmao.</p>

      <p>He mentions Hanbin the most, then Gunwook, then Taerae and I think he only mentioned him once or twice? These four are together in the second floor and Hanbin once said they spend a lot of time together so it makes sense, Hao doesn't seem too close to anyone besides those 3</p>
