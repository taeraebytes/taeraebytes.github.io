      <p>oh you wouldn't be interested, there's no tea it's just essays about gender presentation in k-pop and lesbianism. and haobin rpf sdfkdfgj i ignored those parts but one thing relevant to this cc was her + her friend being really annoyed by people who think ricky is feminine and beautiful like a girl or whatever b/c he's not feminine he's just a douyin boy</p>

      <p>(You should go through her rs anon it's super interesting)
And yeah same I actually had 2 different discussions with 2 different account that though Ricky might be gender non conforming or in the non binary spectrum which made me? Y'all never seen those douyin or xhs boys??? Like he might be queer idk I don't see it but it's not shocking but he's definitely not queer presenting at all his style is fashionable rich Chinese fuck boy and that's OKAY!</p>

      <p>omg i think that zb1 rps cc (was the only other big zb1 cc until they stopped posting rip) actually thought ricky was a trans woman ðŸ˜­ she even included it in her fanfics, and i don't even remember why she thought that besides he's very pretty and also he makes himself small sometimes like ok he's just hot and insecure then</p>
