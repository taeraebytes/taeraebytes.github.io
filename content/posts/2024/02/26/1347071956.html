      <p>The reason why Gyuvin doesn't try to push his relationship with Taerae is because Taerae's popularity is getting low and lower. If Taeraes popularity was higher, trust that Gyuvin would be his bestie üòÇ</p>

      <p>He mentions Hanbin the most, then Gunwook, then Taerae and I think he only mentioned him once or twice? These four are together in the second floor and Hanbin once said they spend a lot of time together so it makes sense, Hao doesn't seem too close to anyone besides those 3</p>
