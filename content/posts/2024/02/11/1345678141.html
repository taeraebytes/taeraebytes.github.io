      <p>Hao can never go on IG lives too much because he wants to listen to kpop songs and he'll get copyright ðŸ˜­ 
That's why he usually goes to bubble for his lives 
He said he doesn't wanna pay too that's why we usually head snippets only.

They might not go on IG lives at this time because of JW situation. So people won't comment much about it</p>
