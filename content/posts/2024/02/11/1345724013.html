      <p>"Zero Base One's fan base is working really hard. Did you think you would be praised if you went to Japan and provided fan service? What the Zeros sisters wanted was to have a vlog of you staying at home on New Year's Day and having a little fun with your pet friends. They wanted to go on a trip to Japan as a beggar and see you be nice to your overseas fans ㅋㅋ"
