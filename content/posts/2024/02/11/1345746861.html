      <p>It pisses me off but sohee is rlly fun and cute hanbin just cant bring his personality out and doesn't work well with someone that doesn't have a bigger personality than him it's why jaehyun works so well for him but I don't rlly like this trio it's just eh to me and I feel sad sohee isn't breaking out of his shell

      <p>also sorry but the visual chemistry is off, sohee would look good being paired with a female mc who is kinda on the uglier side, hanbin just mogs both of them bad like please who tf is looking at jaehyun when hanbin is standing right there, the whole thing looks like its centered around hanbin and his two servants i hate it</p>
