      <p>omg the qrts i saw from some kzerose (maybe trolls/antis too? that account that blew up some jiwoong issues was in there 😭) are mad asfk, probably bc this rubs the salt in the wound concerning the japanese fanmeet/debut, and there are 2 replies in japanese asking them to delete and not post encounters in real time ok let's fly back to korea now 🙏</p>
