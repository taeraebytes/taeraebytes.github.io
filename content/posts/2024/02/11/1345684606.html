      <p>zb1 have a large dedicated fandom (ppl who invest a lot and have zb1 tunnel vision ie. blinks, armys, stays, etc) but itâ€™s sort of a closed community. lot of fandom power but itâ€™s pretty concentrated, they donâ€™t have much reach outside of the fandom. the zb1 fandom on twt is a very distinct space most ppl only focus on the group.

riize on the other hand has an open community. lots of interactions and reach but the the fandom lines are ambiguous. a lot of ppl tune in and keep up w them but itâ€™s more casual. like the big zb1 fanaccs (that arenâ€™t professional/admin run) on twt have like 20-50k followers while most big riize fanaccs have 3-5k and yet their tweets frequently get 10-50k likes bc most of the fandom isnâ€™t actually in the fandom space. having a large dedicated fandom is better for profit and anything voting based (and music shows bc more physical + voting pts) but having greater recognition helps get gigs and opportunities and also digital charting. so theyâ€™re both better than the other in different areas</p>
