      <p>Idk about sales but it is true that Hanbin is the member with the most viral tweets over there lately. But he's the only one with public schedules lately (except for Zhang Hao but why would jfans care about an OST).</p>

      <p>He's always been the 4th most popular in jp after minasangz (Hao gunwook Matthew). Just that Haobin is always after those 3 before hanbin. 

Ricky I feel is the one where you have so many hit tweets in Japan right now because of his style and all like I literally saw 1.5m views of jp tweets for Ricky or just honestly so many hit tweets regarding his looks which is technically what is always happening to him lmao

He's just the Stan attractor</p>

      <p>It's interesting that Ricky gets the most hit tweets articles etc from non fans in the intl, japanese and even Chinese and Korean fandom but doesn't really have a strong solo fandom</p>

      <p>I rlly wonder why that is I haven't seen something like this before you'd think he'd have token stans or the most akgaes in the group because of it

      <p>I mean he def has akgaes but yeah like he's the most popular in Instagram and Tiktok by miles. He always gets hit tweets no matter which country cause of his looks so idk why it doesn't translate to token stanning him too.

Is it because most of the hit tweets are regarding his looks?</p>

      <p>He has akgaes but they're not as common as you'd think and they're more solos than akgaes I think it's cuz there's nothing else blowing up ab him and its not like people are linking things about him I think it's cuz he has the most influencer vibe out of the group
