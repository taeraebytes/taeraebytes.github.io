      <p>on the other sites they said he was #1 the sales aren't shown you can rank the solo editions but they change everyday since it's not over yet. the only site where you can properly see the sales is ktown jp but he's not #1 ðŸ˜•</p>

      <p>thinking gunwook is flopping in japan is hilarious these websites switch ranks every day, it is funny how all these accounts post these ranks of their faves' only specific days when magically that number one alligns with their faves having that spot for the day</p>

      <p>I try to tell these folks sales don't equate to anything especially when theirs different purchasing powers with each member hao and hanbin are the most expensive and sell out the fastest where I live and neither are #1 and #2 in America but yea everyone who puts the #1 just puts it whej it finally aligns it doesn't actually translate thoðŸ˜­

      <p>youâ€™ve gotta apply that logic to ricky then like ricky is the most know but it doesnâ€™t translate to actual fans for him also hao and hanbin genuinely have pretty strong fanbases in the west like iâ€™ve seen a lot of western based zerose surveys and theyâ€™re usually the two most biased in the group</p>

      <p>for america Ricky definitely has the most fans tho I feel like in general he has the most casuals and overall a smaller fanbase but in America he definitely reigns it's not like the fandom is super sized like korea
