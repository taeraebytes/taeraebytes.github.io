      <p>complaining about how wakeone distributes jobs = hanbin hate. of course i don't think he has had any jobs since crush (except mc), but before that hb was the only member that had actual solo jobs (exp. ost, dating show, mc) so i get why the other members fans complained about their bias not getting jobs. back then it was even worse because we had a zb1 content drought. people were overly sensitive. now things are better since we get zb1 content, so there are less complaints when a member get solo jobs.</p>

      <p>Yea I don't get how it was evil to think it was unfair when many members weren't doing jack shit... like I sat for a month watching gunwook do nothing after he had to perform on injury constantly I WAS MAD AS SHITTTTTT like we complained things got somewhat better we move on but my tweet from 3 accs ago is used in evidence for my public execution lollllll

      <p>And now it‚Äôs just Hao getting all the solo jobs but everyone‚Äôs chill, it‚Äôs not just him getting jobs but wakeone promoting tf out of him. They‚Äôre posting a tiktok daily, sent him to mcd to have a special mc stage, got him in the interview, got him in the live, the visual cam, tiktok challenges for an ost (NEVER DONE BEFORE) and also getting him to do the tiktok with other idols for a freaking ost. The way wakeone has promoted other jobs and the way they promote Hao‚Äôs job has a striking difference yet only hanbin was the one to get all the hate when wakeone didn‚Äôt even promote his ost 1/10th of what they‚Äôre doing for hao.

This hypocrisy needs to be stopped coz gw was jobless then and he is jobless now but you won‚Äôt complain now coz you‚Äôd much rather lick rosins. The whole of social media is filled with hao only and barely has others and the people in your ccs saying ‚Äúover TikToks‚Äù are the ones who used to bring tiktok and Twitter post spreadsheets every 2 business days but now no one is bringing them lmao such hypocrisy</p>

      <p>actually ü§ìüëÜ gunwook had the 4th or 5th most schedules during crush and he was getting dance highlights for award shows so yep im happier now. See the difference between u and rosins is when they try to gag they at least have some of the facts right. but ppl are complaining less because everyone expected hao to be treated like royalty and that's what it's giving now but back then he was in the gulag with the rest of the group so yea more outrage you forget how many rosins are in this fandom. and him getting ost promotion ppl will say oh this is how his solo was treated. And now we have bubble and there's zbtv and member lives this is different also because what schedules is hao on he went on mcd to perform once I personally did not care ab the social media argument and again the sender of the trucks is still up in the air and there's equal amount of suspicion towards allindans themselvesüò≠. The difference between then is that we were in hiatus and for gw fans especially he had basically 0 schedules and was performing on injury. There was no bubble no zbtv and there were more schedules for hanbin and no award shows to see everyone every week also a much shittier company team back thenü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è like I'm not sure what u want me to say

      <p>Like as a rosin we'd gladly switch the silly tiktoks with the weekly schedule where he gets to meet so many idols, do tiktoks with them, gets so much exposure from other fandoms these hoes are so ungrateful are insane and the all new jobs being two fucking jobs damn üòë</p>

      <p>It's because most music show MCs are now 5th gen. I haven't seen one who's not going to 5th gen except yeonjun. So everyone is basically just using it to get exposure now</p>
