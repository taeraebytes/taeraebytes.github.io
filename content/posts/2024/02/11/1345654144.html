    "reply": "Yep an older sister and an older brother the older sister is Emily's actual older sister I think she kiiiind of looks like Jessica but you can tell she's not Ricky's sister and the older brother thing is the most obscure piece of sibling \"info\" I've only seen it talked ab like 3 times and ppl say they've seen him and he looks like Ricky and he's apparently born in 2001? but I haven't seen it so I don't believe it. There's a little story around it saying that him and Ricky have a pretty sour relationship and he's closer to their dad and a possible half sibling but yknow how ppl like to write fiction"
