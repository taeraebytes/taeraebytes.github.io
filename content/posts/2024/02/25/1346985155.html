      <p>Honestly the first time someone brought that Gyuvin did it everytime he had a scandal it was eye opening but I thought he def didn't do it on purpose because he's dumb and sincere but when I look at all his actions from the finale til know I def think that while all his relationships are real the way he publicly talk about them is very purposeful and strategic, it was especially obvious with Ricky but he does that with everyone he's smarter than I thought</p>

      <p>by cult thing do u mean that anon on that other ask site that was like gyuvin probably grew up in a cult-like/highly religious environment and was never reprimanded for his behaviour like that or properly learned to socialise ðŸ˜­ bc same honestly like when gyuvin was getting into multiple scandals (that mnet plus slang one, the gay one) i was very annoyed at him but then that made me ease up on him, even if him being in a cult isn't true i could see like an environment similar to that shaping him lmao</p>

      <p>Yep I would paste it but I lost the link and it was too long of an ask but they had tea I would just say very strict religious environment and usually in korea that can point towards cultish since they're so common
