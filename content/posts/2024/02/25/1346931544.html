      <p>weird but tang wei is really pretty... I wonder if skorea is slowly opening up their cinematic industry to chinese actors because she was the main character in a really popular korean movie that won skorea equivilent of oscars and now shes featured in iu's mv and the korean gp loves her. But it could also be her having connections because her husband is a korean director but I don't really think it's because of that tbh</p>
