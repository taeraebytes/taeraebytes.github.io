      <p>gyuvin wants to be their third so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. i wouldn't mind it if he were at least talented. its obvious he got closer to hao through hanbin, which is really weird since gyuvin and hao are in the same company and not the other way around. i just know that hao's ass is tolerating gyuvins most of the times</p>

      <p>Hao is closer to Yunseo than he is to any zb1 yuehuaz members lmao. It's probably because Hao feels too mature compared to them.</p>
