Also during his hiatus he was hanging out with kai, nct and wayv members on many occasions. He even sat next to taeyeon at Key's concert and key even called out to him specifically during his concert and I feel like if he did sa sm wouldn't even let him near other artists let alone publicly share pics with sm artist so I don't know... what do you think?",
