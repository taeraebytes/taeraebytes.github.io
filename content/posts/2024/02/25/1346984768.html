      <p>jiwoong - taehyung, inner child
yes really random song choice but i think jiwoong can sing alright when he sings songs that have a lower register. song choice: he can get pity points from intl fans, kfans will hate this choice cause of the lyrics tho ðŸ˜‚ bts is big in japan, at least one bts member song is a must.

hao - baekhyun, bambi
he would devour this song. the concept of it, the lowkey sensuality, i would love to see him perform this one because it would showcase his lower register (its a need) as well as his high one. you can never go wrong with a baekhyun song.

hanbin - bol4, some
choosing a song for hanbin was difficult because his vocal tone is really sweet. i wanted to choose something that showcased his dancing more but i feel like a stage where he looks pretty and sings would be nice for a change since he already danced for invu

taerae - ed sheeran, shivers
i thought about choosing a korean ballad song but that would be too boring, he needs to challange himself with different singing styles. he could play the guitar for this song

matthew - b.i, btbt
i had to do it, i know the possibility of him covering that song because of what b.i did is impossible but that song suits matthew. he would nail this dance since his own personal style is close to it.

ricky - billie eilish, lovely
rickys vocal tone would do this song justice. yes its a slow song but he has visuals people will want to look act so its fine. i was between rnb sounds or ballads, wanted him to showcase his vocals more

gyuvin - lil nas x, old town road
im sorry ðŸ˜‚ but no other song came into my mind. he would at least have fun on the stage and  people could defend him by saying its the concept of the song in case he sings off key.

gunwook - mino, body
i wanted to choose a song that showcases his rapping. i love the song, its moody, it would be a great way to show that he can perform different types of songs. gunwook would nail this song.

yujin - kai, mmmh
their tones are kinda similiar (kinda nasal), yujin would body the dance, the song has little lines. i probably thought about which song would suit yujin if he had a solo stage the most.

sorry its this long ðŸ«£</p>

      <p>I feel like all rosins are just waiting for Hao to cover a baekhyun song officially. Lmao like he said he will do a tiktok of one baekhyun song then Yujin did it.

Gunwook yeah he suits mino songs. 

Hanbin either needs a performance based songs or a sweet stage. Never an in between one or a vocal focused one. 

Matthew honestly suits jay park songs the most with his vocal tone lmao

Rk needs to do English covers yep</p>
