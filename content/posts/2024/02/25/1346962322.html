    "question": "Think piece here, but the sole reason Taerae got to zb1 for intl fans is because they think Mnet was hindering him with the screentime (especially since he was the token main vocal of kfans) everyone just navigates towards him since they needed to do a finding Taerae. It just didn't do enough to make the casuals who voted for him to stay. Like have we forgotten that Taerae is the first member to get a solo sched (koms)? They were clearly trying to get those casuals to Stan him esp since the songs there definitely suits his tone and his church oppa image until his image went to 180Â° . Like intl fans already knew him for kkotgaruz but kfans didn't or didn't think it's real real until now. \n\nWhich is unlike gunwook where he got a massive hate train until Mnet showed that baby edit of his with Hao in episode 6 where after that, every video of gunwook just makes everyone be a fan of his. Like if everyone even remembers, if you're so confident of your skills and wants to appeal to public being so confident, you'll just get hate from knetzðŸ˜­ like literally.\n\nFor Hao, the thing is, he was shown as he was from before though? The serious, very perfectionist, and frankly cares about the performance type. The difference with Taerae and Hao is you can see Hao's last dancing or his dance gg covers so his kfans already knew what to expect. Even his scandals and all. But Taerae never had that. He was just the church oppa. So their image is basically similar in a sense that they're both twinks but it differs from there.\n\nYou can even see it on their tiktoks together lmao, Hao never goes all out unlike his past gg dancing where he throws everything like move his hips, throw his back up and all, like he's doing it so cleanly that his fans still likes it unlike with taerae where you can basically see the difference lmao.\n\nWhen they do duo tiktok together, Hao looks so straight compared to Taerae who really is so feminine ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",
    "reply": "Yea I agree someone said smth ab it and I said while intl fans view hao and taerae the same kfans dont and in retrospect hao does look less feminine than taerae at times especially recently I don't even think he looks that feminine it's also the styling he gets is bad"
