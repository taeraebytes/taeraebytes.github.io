      <p>I feel bad for taerae, he should go back to black hair and now I know what people mean some idol image are better not knowing like I love taerae but his funny sassy twink image isn’t helping him but surprisingly how it helping zh when both were shown different image on bp & zb1 like zh was shown  as cold, introverted, perfectionist, who doesn’t know how to perform cute song & taerae as nerd, church oppa, who doesn’t talk much, cold & handsome BUT then—</p>

      <p>Taerae and hao present themselves in different ways but intl fans interpret it the same way. I feel like if you honestly in ur heart dont believe hao is gay you can gf stan on him but not for taerae and i didn't even think he was gay now idk but I just don't see how anyone could gf stan him so that's the issue. Plus taerae is styled in the most horrid way possible I actually can't even look
