      <p>We need hao hanbin Gunwook, Gunwook with gyuvin or jiwoong they would split the rap. This way he’d get all the rap and vocals ntm the performance aspect of it would be the best.</p>

      <p>Oop and I actually wanted Hao Hanbin Gunwook at first but it would be too unbalanced talent wise 😭I put Gunwook with gyujin for the maknae clout and they can do something very dance focused</p>

      <p>We can do Hanbin Gunwook Matthew (performance based)
Hao Ricky Yujin (violin x piano - classical music)
Taerae Gyuvin Jiwoong (I don't really know) 

But I feel like it's better if we actually get one classical performance since it's usually dance or vocal based performance. Let's get every demographic now</p>
