      <p>"I still remember rosins went crazy because dazed put hanbin and f4 for their bio" It was for the header, I was never this embarassed in my life when that whole thing went down. the header was hanbin first, then people (mostly rosins) complained about it saying zb1 is not just hanbin, then dazed changed it into some four members since that way it fitted the most members into that small space (dont remember which members) but they complained AGAIN. dazed just kinda gave up at that point, they changed the header three more times (all different members) and then stopped changing it with the header looking weird... i really wonder why we havent gotten another one of those dazed photoshoots ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>
