      <p>gyuvin wants to be their third so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. i wouldn't mind it if he were at least talented. its obvious he got closer to hao through hanbin, which is really weird since gyuvin and hao are in the same company and not the other way around. i just know that hao's ass is tolerating gyuvins most of the times</p>

      <p>The hard thing with Gyuvin is he did too much bullshit for a rookie but like you can tell he's just ignorant and nice and doesn't mean harm, I get the people who don't fuck w him anymore and I get people who love him still</p>
