      <p>I feel bad for taerae, he should go back to black hair and now I know what people mean some idol image are better not knowing like I love taerae but his funny sassy twink image isn’t helping him but surprisingly how it helping zh when both were shown different image on bp & zb1 like zh was shown  as cold, introverted, perfectionist, who doesn’t know how to perform cute song & taerae as nerd, church oppa, who doesn’t talk much, cold & handsome BUT then—</p>

      <p>Taerae and hao present themselves in different ways but intl fans interpret it the same way. I feel like if you honestly in ur heart dont believe hao is gay you can gf stan on him but not for taerae and i didn't even think he was gay now idk but I just don't see how anyone could gf stan him so that's the issue. Plus taerae is styled in the most horrid way possible I actually can't even look

      <p>"I actually can't even look" if you don't have anything good to say then don't mention him at all because 99% of the time you talk about him you're harassing him seriously</p>

      <p>well taerae is a flop and will continue flopping. i even think that wakeone is not gonna include him in the wakeone redebut bgroup (with the way they dont listen to his kfans and let him do what he wants +not alot of social media presence and if he does post things kfans hate thode). they will get gunwook in the group as a main vocalist unless yuehua gets him first</p>

      <p>excuse me? nuh uhhhh ur crazy we are not letting gunwook redebut in either company but wakeone likes the other 3 wakeonez more than him he's the most known for being zb1 so they'll include him if they're smart but he might leave and do some solo
