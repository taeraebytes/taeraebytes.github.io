      <p>Hi. Genuine question. Why do ya'll hate Jiwoong and Taerae? And aside from Wookie, who do you think you would like or who will be pass in your liking? And who's your favorite duo of Gunwook?</p>

      <p>i dont hate anyone but i dont see a reason in being fond of everyone its a survival show group im only here because of my 1pick😭 kudos to the ppl that love everyone i like the group but its pretty conditional for me and i didnt care ab taerae but the influx of taerae anons picking fights w me is making me srsly dislike him so hell catch it moving forward🤷‍♀️ i have members i genuinely like tho i like matthw yujin hao even when i get annoyed i find it hard to hate on them 04z are my same age chingus i could never hate either and even after all the beef allins have w me im just indifferent towards hanbin and i always was before they just made me mad so i did it back🌝 my fav duos are with the members i like mattwook maknaez gyuwook i like gunhao but theyre not giving rn and riwook was my royalty duo but ricky hasnt been keeping his side of it alive😑
