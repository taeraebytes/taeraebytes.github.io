      <p>Honestly the first time someone brought that Gyuvin did it everytime he had a scandal it was eye opening but I thought he def didn't do it on purpose because he's dumb and sincere but when I look at all his actions from the finale til know I def think that while all his relationships are real the way he publicly talk about them is very purposeful and strategic, it was especially obvious with Ricky but he does that with everyone he's smarter than I thought</p>
