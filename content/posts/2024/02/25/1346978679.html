      <p>gyuvin wants to be their third so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. i wouldn't mind it if he were at least talented. its obvious he got closer to hao through hanbin, which is really weird since gyuvin and hao are in the same company and not the other way around. i just know that hao's ass is tolerating gyuvins most of the times</p>
