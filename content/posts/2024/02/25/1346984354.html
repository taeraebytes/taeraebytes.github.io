      <p>The reason why Gyuvin doesn't try to push his relationship with Taerae is because Taerae's popularity is getting low and lower. If Taeraes popularity was higher, trust that Gyuvin would be his bestie ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>That's actually a hilarious but totally plausible reasonðŸ˜­ It's not like Gyuvin playfully pushes Taerae off but still interacts, he fully doesnt interact with him at all and legit the only member beside maybe Zhanghao he doesn't drape himself all over</p>
