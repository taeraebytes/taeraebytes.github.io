      <p>Honestly the first time someone brought that Gyuvin did it everytime he had a scandal it was eye opening but I thought he def didn't do it on purpose because he's dumb and sincere but when I look at all his actions from the finale til know I def think that while all his relationships are real the way he publicly talk about them is very purposeful and strategic, it was especially obvious with Ricky but he does that with everyone he's smarter than I thought</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m suprised more allins didnâ€™t clock into this because it was so obvious to me after Splatbin mentioned it but everytime he caught even the slightest bit of heat he would start mentioning haobin and posting duo selcas and talking about past storys or giving tmi which is all fine but itâ€™s noticing the pattern of when he chooses to talk about him.</p>
