      <p>tired of people writing thinkpieces of taerae's popularity when the sole reason for him being unpopular is because he had 0 screentime on boys planet and the zb1 fandom never grew beyond boys planet times how would he have a big core fandom when he has no presence in the show? all other members including your bias got tailored arcs and main character treatment since the first episode the only exception is Ricky</p>

      <p>Gunwook had the worst editing out of the 8 the producers liked him but that was such a set up and started his hate train like the fact that he debuted and ranked good after all that was a miracle most of the members would not have survived that. But taerae was like the Korean Ricky he had a lot of casuals and ppl that just wanted to vote him in no he didn't have a dedicated fandom but unlike Ricky the casuals are pretty much all gone now

      <p>To say Gwk had the worst editing just because they shows him saying innapropriate shits during the eliminations is insaneðŸ’€ Taerae only got screentime last few episodes when Gwk was a main character from the first episode nobody asked him to act the way he did</p>
