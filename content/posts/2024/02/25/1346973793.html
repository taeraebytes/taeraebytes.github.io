      <p>i dont hate anyone but i dont see a reason in being fond of everyone its a survival show group im only here because of my 1pick😭 kudos to the ppl that love everyone i like the group but its pretty conditional for me and i didnt care ab taerae but the influx of taerae anons picking fights w me is making me srsly dislike him so hell catch it moving forward🤷‍♀️ i have members i genuinely like tho i like matthw yujin hao even when i get annoyed i find it hard to hate on them 04z are my same age chingus i could never hate either and even after all the beef allins have w me im just indifferent towards hanbin and i always was before they just made me mad so i did it back🌝 my fav duos are with the members i like mattwook maknaez gyuwook i like gunhao but theyre not giving rn and riwook was my royalty duo but ricky hasnt been keeping his side of it alive😑
