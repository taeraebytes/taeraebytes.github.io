      <p>Yup, and now you see deobis and stays tweaking every day bc more moments of them keep coming out. It's son fun tho. But this pair is not a good match, I fear that we are getting an Eric x Changmin eating out with Nancy and Jiwon moment soon but this time with Itzy and maybe some Aespa member ðŸ˜­</p>
