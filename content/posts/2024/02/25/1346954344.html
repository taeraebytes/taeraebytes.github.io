      <p>nah but they have to be dating someone from Itzy or they are super best friends bc sunwoo clocked out of a fansign and went to the concert while hyunjin went straight up to the concert after a flight from europe</p>

      <p>Yup, and now you see deobis and stays tweaking every day bc more moments of them keep coming out. It's son fun tho. But this pair is not a good match, I fear that we are getting an Eric x Changmin eating out with Nancy and Jiwon moment soon but this time with Itzy and maybe some Aespa member 😭</p>
