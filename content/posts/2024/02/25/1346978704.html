      <p>On the topic of Gunwook he's not my bias but I'm rewatching boys planet for the first time and damn how did i not notice him and his skills at all , is it only me who only had tunnel vision for my fav and his stages and the ppl he interacted I think I used to zone out for others , especially haobin I hate ppl who are hyped so I used to skip them on purpose but gwk rlly ate kill this love up</p>
