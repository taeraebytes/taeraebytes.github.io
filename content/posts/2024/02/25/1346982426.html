      <p>gyuvin wants to be their third so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. i wouldn't mind it if he were at least talented. its obvious he got closer to hao through hanbin, which is really weird since gyuvin and hao are in the same company and not the other way around. i just know that hao's ass is tolerating gyuvins most of the times</p>

      <p>I don't think I could explain the layers to the gyuvin munch jokes like it's been months in the making also im lazy but gyuvin just has a habit of speaking ab specific members in a certain way and his "growth" when he starts catching heat I think he's grown but it was very funny when he was getting whacked back to back and he's being up hanbin and his big heart it doesn't have anything to do with friendship

      <p>the thing with gyuvin is that he latches onto people and doesnt let go. alot of people would find that annoying, hanbin doesnt. thats probably why hanbin tries to be extra nice to gyuvin. since gyuvin is literally sticking to him (buying him expensive stuff and shit) and yes gyuvin is probably thankful towards hanbin because he had a hard time during bp but its just hanbins personality to be nice and supportive. if any of the other members had a bad time and they acted like gyuvin towards hanbin, hanbin would talk the same way about them. most of the members are not weird like that (gyuvin) tho, they know when to stop with the jokes or when its too much. gyuvin doesnt get that. hanbin in my eyes is just trying to help him get more mature. gyuvin hanging around and being liked by hanbin, who has the perfect idol image helps gyuvin ALOT. im not judging btw, it is a smart move on gyuvins side. most of the trainees there knew hanbin was popular and would probably continue being so after they saw the internet reviews/episode came out.</p>
