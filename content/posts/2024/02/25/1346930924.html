      <p>"The only difference is how Ricky will always get the most screams in each country, even if he's nugu on that one" im sorry but i dont get riyangis point of rickys is popular everywhere. the only places he is popular at are instagram and tiktok. i personally find most of rickys behaviours cringe, but everybody has their own opinions about that. rickys actual fanbase size is around the same as gunwooks. thirst traps always get alot of views on ig and tiktok, plus i feel like alot of children (under 18) stan ricky because of his fandom buying power. those same children are really active on ig and tiktok hence the views and likes</p>

      <p>Not a ricky stan but fans are still fans no matter what age idk y ppl always discredit that. So what if theyre children and y is it so hard to accept casual fans are still fans. Like do u have to own 5 albums 10 pcs for a 'fan' to be consider part of the 'actual fanbase'? When did being a fan come with criteria and rules. I just hate it when ppl always discredit casual fans as if they're not fans like wtf? 

Just because u personally find him cringe doesn't mean everyone else does and clearly a lot more ppl like him for what he does and are fans of him albeit casual or not they're still fans. Like I'm 17 and a 'children' to anon, only bought one album yits and I don't even have a gw pc does that mean Im not a fan of gw?</p>
