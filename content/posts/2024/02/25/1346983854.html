      <p>On the topic of Gunwook he's not my bias but I'm rewatching boys planet for the first time and damn how did i not notice him and his skills at all , is it only me who only had tunnel vision for my fav and his stages and the ppl he interacted I think I used to zone out for others , especially haobin I hate ppl who are hyped so I used to skip them on purpose but gwk rlly ate kill this love up</p>

      <p>no tbh it's just that his stages weren't that great. He was overrated for both singing and dancing and then the only his fans would ever talk about is that his brother was begging people to vote for him. It was the most apparent when he did that scripted killing part re audition with gunwook.</p>
