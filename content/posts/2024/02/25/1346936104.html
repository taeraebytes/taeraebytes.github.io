      <p>This whole lucas issue is making me lose hope, seeing so many tweets supporting him coming from women is just so disheartening and disappointing</p>

      <p>Different anon and extremely hot take but if you really look into it I feel like he did cheat but perhaps not the sa stuff because the sa stuff were allegedly from yangyang sasaengs who hate him because lucas called them out or something to sm and they got blacklisted. Also during his hiatus he was hanging out with kai, nct and wayv members on many occasions. He even sat next to taeyeon at Key's concert and key even called out to him specifically during his concert and I feel like if he did sa sm wouldn't even let him near other artists let alone publicly share pics with sm artist so I don't know... what do you think?</p>

      <p>That's a rumor but sasaeng or not the evidence they brought forward and the multiple stories it's sexual assault and him admitting it in his doc is enough for me. he didn't get backlash this bad over some cheating and whoring there's idols that go to salons and fuck prostitutes and still have some kind of career
