      <p>tbh idt what he did was actually that bad bc the fan likely was being a nuisance and who wouldn't feel like that but DAMN at least do it after the event ðŸ˜­ and he's the most experienced one out of them like i know fancalls weren't a thing in prehistoric ass 2016 but C'MONNNNNNNNNNNN he should know. i do feel like this was posted BECAUSE of the japan debut/fanmeet or maybe they found out about him dating and were annoyed so they posted this to get him lmfao. i'm actually surprised i haven't seen more against him on the tl like the Actual dorm/gf stuff (but then again i'm not actually looking into the korean side, just my tl)</p>
