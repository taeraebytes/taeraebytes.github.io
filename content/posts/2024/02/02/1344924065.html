on one hand im glad the Gunwook stuff barely made it to Engtwt, but im getting annoyed at how this 'fast' wakeone statement is largely being accredited to Jiwoong after just a few hours when Gunwook and others like Hanbin have been left to rot in their drama all week like can we spare them some notice pls</p>
