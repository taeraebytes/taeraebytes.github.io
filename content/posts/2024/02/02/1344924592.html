      <p>wakeone put out a notice about them suing people, collecting evidence and stuff (hanbin, yujin, gunwook and gyuvins things) which is great. why are jiwoong fans cheering tho? this notice is not for jiwoongs case ðŸ’€ like im sorry to tell them this but jiwoong said and acted like that by his own will, it wasnt fabricated, w1 cant really sue someone when the video is just how he is like. jiwoongs ass is done for. w1 was probably trying to calm down intl fans since they started defending jw and stuff but i just know that kfans are cursing w1 for this. this notice is actual damage control</p>
