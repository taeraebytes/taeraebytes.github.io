      <p>but what are the chances zb1 can even attend... any later date they're gonna be busy af cause jpn debut is literally around the corner and k comeback is right after + who knows the amount of pre comeback content they have to pre film + world tour prep. 

I'm so fckign pissed this was going to be my first time attending anythign kpop related because of zb1 and this happens. What are your experiences with postponed concerts and if its normal for artist lineup to change because original artist can't attend anymore due to schedule conflicts?</p>

      <p>Honestly it's not looking good the closest rebooking will probably be in weeks if not months and zb1 are gonna get super busy. But we can rely on the fact that breaks do not exist in that industry so it's possible they could squeeze a week in tbz we're flying out almost immediately after performing cuz of their schedules for kcon. And yea it's normal for lineups to change if artists can't attend people are speculating the artists don't even know yet or found out when we did because apparently hao was just talking ab krazy a few hrs before the statement got posted
