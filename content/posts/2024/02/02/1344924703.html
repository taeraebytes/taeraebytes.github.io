    "question": "\"I hope they put him in a \"hiatus\" tbh\" that would be great tbh. cause i feel like the boys are gonna go to japan and yknow promote their japanese album and stuff but isnt it going to be awkward af with jiwoong there. having a member that cursed behind fans back is not a good look ðŸ˜¬. he should either put out an apology, go to hiatus or just leave the group. im fine with both options ðŸ˜Š i always knew he was weird cause who tf is friends with mr racist (jongwoo)",
    "reply": "The group has better chemistry as 8 since they're actually closer to one another but idk I just wish this never happenedddddddd but a hiatus would be best tbh"
