      <p>"ofc it would come out later they should've posted this days ago" im pretty sure that this statement was supposed to be released another day. they rushed it because of jiwoongs situation. nowhere in that statement did they mention jiwoongs situation. they probably only started collecting things after hanbins company released their statement about suing people. im sure the companies talked about what to do/how to act. then gunwooks thing happened and wakeone started investigations on that. they probably were like "lets write a statemet since fans want to know whats going on/what we have been up to" they also wrote things that concern all the members so it doesnt look like they are only suing people/investigating people that hate on h/gw. thats how todays statement got written. wakeone cant really write a "we will sue" statement on jw case cause he actually did all these things on the videos, the fan was just sharing it. if w1 does decide to call the lawyers on the fan... oh mama hell would break lose. even more than just now, cause then every subfandoms would be like "this company really doesnt care about fans"</p>
