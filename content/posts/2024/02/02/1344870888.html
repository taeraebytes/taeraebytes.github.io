      <p>it's both baek and taeyeon fans saying it's disrespectful to both singers ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and you know the issue of copyright with ai covers esp in kr so many idols said they don't like the idea of someone using their voice to promote other songs idk</p>

      <p>Ehhhh I feel like with the normalization and the access to the software there's not much u can do and for the most part the fans find it fun I'm usually against ai but I kind of get it as well but I get the other side as well but if those specific artists expressed their dislike of covers then ouuu that's smth else
