    "question": "did u see the notice zb1 put out? one of the bits basically says they're taking action against the person who did that gunwook rumour (it mentions someone who illegally obtained artist's personal info and tried to contact them). the timing of the notice is pretty cursed though bc i think it came out just after the jiwoong thing started blowing up, wk1 have probably seen it and will make him apologise when he wakes up lmao",
    "reply": "Finally legal action for my baby but yea this means they're gonna be forced to address this immediately which imo is good"
