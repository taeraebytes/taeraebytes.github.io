      <p>o dammmmmmmmmmnn so wakeone just rented trucks of their own and parked it where the protest trucks are supposed to park so now the protest trucks cant park there (probably because the trucks are making stops at different places so when they come back to wakeone they'll have no place to park). 

wow wakeone doing everything for jw but did nothing when other fandoms sent hate trucks</p>
