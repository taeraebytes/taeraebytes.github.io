      <p>just making an early prediction but this is going to go viral on knetz side again, the logo is hilarious it basically spells out ssi-bal using jiwoong 'ssi' fastly 'bbal' leave the group, it already went semi viral bc of bbosongie , on the good side wakeone is in a apartment zone where ppl live the road is really narrow so drivers and normal ppl can report and it gets taken away very quickly, it happened with a truck before but the most recent hanbin one flopped bc the driver kept coming back</p>
