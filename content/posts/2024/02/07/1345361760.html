      <p>I think it's about time w1/ jiwoong releases a statement or apology or something becayse haters are getting out of control.... they're literally hating on everything. Some jammin fans outside w1 put a bunch of postit notes at the bus stop for the members and now knets are shitting on them for polluting but every fan does this when their idol has an advertisement like during bp.</p>
