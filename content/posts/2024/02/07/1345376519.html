      <p>Really Wakeone must really love Jiwoong; giving him a while show for some reason, sending him to a Gucci event with Hanbin (when we all know he's one of the most disliked members to begin with in Korea since gf gate), doing woonghao yaoi to boost his show when Hao hates him, not making him apologize and doubling down on the fan being at fault, not getting any consequences for his previous rudeness and mishaps,(compare with Ricky, even Gyuvin got more discipline), allegedly blocking the trucks, and promoting haobin NOW to distract the fandom and not during the previous huge hate waves or in general cause they're the most popular Kpop ship in general 
It's really interesting, any other company would immediately put him on hiatus, I wonder if it's because since he's independent they don't have to share his cut with another company as its definitely not due to his popularity</p>
