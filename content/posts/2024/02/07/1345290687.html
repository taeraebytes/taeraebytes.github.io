      <p>i genuinely think gyuvin is straight and homophobic. he had a girlfriend in the past and was ready to drop everything for her, the jokes he makes are like those typical straight homophobic dudes that like ‚Äúdeep jokes‚Äù no your just making fun of a disabled person you twat. gyuvin is STIFF ASF when he dances too like every dancer is supposed to know how to dance with the flow and everything but his azz thinks it‚Äôs probably gay to move a bit of hip so he stays stiff. he‚Äôs very fckn touchy with yujin it‚Äôs weird and why is he making sexual jokes towards ricky as well and he always leeches onto members with the most fame because he‚Äôs a nugu in his group. he was also getting whacked badly on the kside, koreans were saying the ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù joke came off homophobic and people shouldn‚Äôt hype it up few days later he started doing extreme fanserivce with ricky got also whacked for being a bully, ableist and sexually harassing ricky, doing the most to beat those homophobic allegations and mind you during that period he barely mentioned hanbin until he got hate üíÄüíÄ now he is back to leeching off haobin.</p>

      <p>Gyuvin is painfully straight but he's one of those guys who didn't realize gay people are fr real and he doesn't know how to act but I don't think he's homophobic just a very textbook teen boy at times. he probably says homophobic adjacent things, jokes, etc I mean that wouldn't be surprising but I wouldn't say that he truly has that hate in his heart. It's very clear that his coming out joke was not a good joke and just very wrong but it's INSANE how fans can twist things in their idols favors... gyuvin isn't gay he's not fighting for gay rights and I think ppl would rather kill themselves than have gyuvin be their gay rights activist

      <p>idk if this is a reach or not but when gyuvin was venting on live that one time and he said that hanbin has been helping him a lot recently and said "i know you're a good person" to him, it made me think if hanbin had some kind of come to jesus talk with him about the coming out joke (this was before all the ricky stuff happened so idk what else that convo could've been about)...i just think he's ignorant</p>
