      <p>"Straight boy yaoi realness💁‍♀️" is gunwook with ricky 💅💅 i never saw the appeal in gyuwook or gyubrick(?). the reason for that is gyuvin is giving straight boy too much, like he is straight, he breaths straight. my otps in zb1 are haobin and gunricky. if wakeone only gave us gunricky meals... THE AUDIENCE IS WAITING</p>
