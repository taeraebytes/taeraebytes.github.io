      <p>I can answer one more question if u want then im off to bed but im not gonna name no names unless u mention it first or give me a name like sklen but ill admit i only know bout cssgs, kssgs are more gossipy he said she said because sometimes the cssgs in the hybrid c/k ssgs gc would have internal fights and rant bout them in the c only gc. cssgs i know their entire lifestyle and how they operate and their faces ðŸ˜­ 

its just funny because i was lurking and ur anons were throwing a fit over flight info and the morals over sharing it cuz flight info isnt even that bad compared to everything else. same with fansites cuz for the most part fansites are just ppl working they take their pics and dip make merch and sell them and thats how they make their buck like yeah some buy flight info but its for work plus an occasional ssibal comment under their breath cuz the members dont look into their cameras so they have to photoshop their pupils to make it look like the theyre looking into the camera ðŸ˜­ its actually more common than u think esp if u a ssg fansite. if i were to rank the lvl of crazy itd be

airport fans < fansites that attend schedules airport arrivals and departures but dont go with them abroad < fansites that buy flight info and go abroad with them but imo these two types of fansites arent even crazy because theyre strictly work but they can get quite aggressive cuz money is on the line < then u got the ssg fansites where the delusions start and their motive isnt to get pictures to make banners and merch to sell to fans these ssg fansites actually like the members and theres levels to these from a crush to straight up worship god status but most of these are the broke ssgs i talked about < then u got straight up ssgs. these are the bat shit crazy ones u should be scared of cuz they aint even a fansite and dont even own cameras they just want to be in their presence and film with their phones and they move in groups. most of the pictures and videos they take will never go public and are super invasive. they also rich af so they can literally do whatever they want without consequences esp since theyre cssgs any local laws wont really apply to them which is y their panties get extra wet when they go to sea.</p>
