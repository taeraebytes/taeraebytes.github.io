      <p>I mean it's true lol but like both Seungeon and Taerae fan accounts don't need to be like an angel since they're both the same with their main vocals beef. 

When zb1 sang jelly pop on fancon, there's like posts saying "ah, this is why we don't want to hear jelly pop, as expected, Seungeon and hui are just different. Jelly pop is jelly pop with Hao center Seungeon and hui vocal"</p>
