      <p>i do think this jiwoong thing probably scared the members like they've had other controversies but neverrrrrrrrr on this scale ðŸ˜­ they're gonna be on their best behaviour, plus with how crush was hated by zb1's own fans it seems clear that they're never gonna go in that direction again (wk1 is stupid but idt they're that stupid) LET'S GET THAT PAK GUYS</p>

      <p>I wish this was true it's like they get amnesia and act how they usually which isn't bad but the smallest things snowball and they do the wrong things at the wrong time

      <p>yeji ryujin chaeryeong and yuna all icons who at least gave something to culture. from aespa we only like ningning and karina and yet none of them gave us an iconic moment, Lesserafim we only like chaewon and yujin and at least they gave something yunjin with her Dancebreak and chaewon with her stage mistake but the other 3 are giving nothing</p>

      <p>they had their time and we appreciated them but it's not 2019-2020 and they haven't been able to hit anything since which is definitely due to jyp mismanaging and neglecting them but it's facts for aespa all 4 members are starting to make their marks but lsfm is mid city and had their rise in one likkle era and couldn't keep momentum
