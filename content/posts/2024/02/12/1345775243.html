      <p>Wow ur real as fuck if ur still sticking with me but my cc started in may and I would post it probably some moots some followers then my acc got bigger and I just had a lot of lurkers and the one random day I got 400 ccs in my inbox and I stopped posting them on Twitter cuz I had a bunch of lame mutuals that were causing a ruckus😑 but I didn't get anything close to this till people started exposing it😭

      <p>honestly ppl should just leave ccs and privs alone like when ur expose these ppl ur just exposing shit to everyone that otherwise would’ve stayed between a few ppl. like when lotuses priv got exposed like sure some of her tweets were kinda weird but there was no need to spread it like ITS A PRIV if she was a public acc purposefully defaming or harassing the members sure but all it did was feed ppls savior mentality and start a shit ron of unnecessary drama and if anton lurks (which he prob does but i think on tt not twitter) he would’ve seen it. tbh yall shouldn’t have had the space and just laid it to rest but literally all of it should’ve just been avoided me and her were moots on her main and we lowkey had eos back in a fanwar so i just lurked and stayed out of it bc ppl were only ratioing to feed their ego and seem like a “pure stan” bc it only made the situation worse. yes she’s schizo yes the anton comments were parasocial yes the taro comment was weird asf but those weren’t recent and again literally on priv. maybe it’s cus im autistic but i understand getting super hyper fixated in an unhealthy way that’s why i am on cc 😭😭 like i told u i’ve been here since october even tho i don’t stan zb1 and never did (i did fixate on them for like 2 months and i still like gunwook and matthew) bc there’s like a code of conduct on stan twt and here ppl can actually say things without sugarcoating or starting a war</p>

      <p>EXACTLY they only exposed her cuz they hate her not cuz they care cuz if they cared they wouldn't have made it bigger than it was cuz Anton's searches got fucked up. And JJRMFMEMMFMSNFKFK IM SORRY WETE ADDICTED TO SPACE AND WE JUST WANTED TO FIGHT😭😭😭😭😭 we were on discord and I told her to just irk everyone even harder since it's all out there. But the thing ab her u gotta understand is she's never serious and just says crazy shit like she rlly is hyperfoxated and she loves Anton more than life it was just performativw rlly but glad u have fun here I'll try to tell her to come back lol
