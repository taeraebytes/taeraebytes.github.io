      <p>They said it might be fashion week but that makes no sense because Milan fashion week is end of February and Paris last week of February to the 1st week of March. None of those would effect flights that are scheduled for the end of March. Plus zb1 are too nugu to be going to fashion week Iâ€™m sorry ðŸ˜­ like ny maybe but not Milan or Paris</p>
