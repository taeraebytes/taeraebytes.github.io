      <p>i do think this jiwoong thing probably scared the members like they've had other controversies but neverrrrrrrrr on this scale ðŸ˜­ they're gonna be on their best behaviour, plus with how crush was hated by zb1's own fans it seems clear that they're never gonna go in that direction again (wk1 is stupid but idt they're that stupid) LET'S GET THAT PAK GUYS</p>

      <p>I wish this was true it's like they get amnesia and act how they usually which isn't bad but the smallest things snowball and they do the wrong things at the wrong time
