      <p>anton taesan and leehan would have been a better trio if they wanted to do a rookie male mc trio bc they‚Äôre stan attractors, the same age, and it wouldn‚Äôt b awkward bc they‚Äôre close friends (at least anton and taesan are) bc anton was originally prob gonna debut in bnd so he trained w them for a year or so. the current mcd trio doesn‚Äôt work bc hanbin is a boomer in a 22 year old body, sohee is a middle schooler with 0 thoughts going through his head, and myungjae is a 5 year old running on 3 cans of red bull. taesan anton hanbin honestly would‚Äôve made a bit more sense (i see why they picked that trio for the christmas stage now) but it would also be awkward bc taesan and anton are close and hanbin would have a weird parental role bc of the age gap</p>

      <p>but u need the ‚Äúboomer‚Äù or basically a mature and responsible person sorry but anton is not ready to be a mc idk about leehan or taesan but jaehyun is at least high energy to bounce off that matureness, i think its just unfortunate cause miyeon was very experienced and it would be nice to see hanbin as a mc without looking like he‚Äôs taking care of 2 kindergarten kids, like he already is so stiff during schedules they couldnt find him another noona?üíî

also idk why ur up in here recommending 3 non zb1 members like we dont care about them men</p>
