      <p>but hanbin doctor knew when to stop something that yuehua and matthew doctors are incapable to do, that's why gunwook should never touch his face and if he wants to do it he better contact hanbin and not gyuvin or matthew.</p>

      <p>why was gyuvin mentioned? his double eyelids are natural, his nose definitely wouldn‚Äôt look like that if he got it done, and he has the exact same crimson chin as his father and brotherüò≠ unless it‚Äôs something else</p>

 i don‚Äôt know about the nose tip implant. anyway, he told the story about the scar on his chin before. when he was younger, he hit his chin on a table and had to get it stitched up. you can see the same scar in one of his childhood photos.</p>
