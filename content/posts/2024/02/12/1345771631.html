      <p>I'm here but lol there's no tea. Btw I don't feel like sklen is ssfans, yeah she buys flight information and flies with them acting like a maniac at the airport but those are all times when they have schedules. . I only know what they talk about in c ssfans gc and they are all clearly delulu  anf mainly care about the three members, Hao Ricky and Yujin obviously.  Hao: Hao jesusto them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don't talk bad about him but he's not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that's the perfect way to communicate with ssfan.
 Ricky, if he's in a public place or on a schedule, he'll interact, otherwise he'll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol, they say he's either too cocky about his family background so he's arrogant or he likes richer fans so he treats them like that. They were serious about Yujin dating, even paying his classmates to see if he talked to any girls at school. ZB1 isn't too close, they hang out more in groups, Gunwook usually hangs out with Gyuvin and Ricky is a plus one but recently he's gotten closer with Matthew but everyone knows that lol.</p>

      <p>ouuuuu I feel like there's hella inconsistencies with Ricky's personality there's times where people say he's arrogant and times where he looks and acts like a kicked puppy and they're probably both genuine reactions it's just interesting how different they are. I know some girls that are heavy into cent and understand Chinese and lurk weibo they said some ex-yh trainees and even debuted celebs made a few anecdotal posts on weibo anonymously ab Ricky pretty early into bp saying they hated him and such and such. They were pretty much saying every Chinese yh trainee is like rich as fuck and they all have certain types of personalities and Ricky was probably super shitty if they all hated him but I was like if rich abysmal ppl all hate one dude they can't be that innocent eitherðŸ˜­ idk how true this is considering I was under the impression Ricky trained under yh korea but some ppl said even if Chinese trainees were under the kr division they still interacted and were grouped with the Chinese trainees the most. Plus someone was saying it's part of the reason he was never considered for boyhood(?) boystory(?) idfk cuz they never got along well except for that one boy. Also side note I want gyuriwook and Matthew to be a little friend group they get along well

      <p>not anon and ngl c ssg groups are notorious for shit talking idols if they don't get things their way and it shows from wat anon said cuz how is he cocky for wanting to protect his fams priviacy ðŸ˜­ like these bitches stalking him at night and think hell give them handshakes???? idk but as an ex nct and bts stan and as a chinese myself who goes on weibo/ baidu i hate c ssgs the most because if u interact with them where they shouldnt be they become mad delusional, thinking theyre special and thats where they truly become demons. They start missions in their ssg group chat and escalates the level batshit crazy cuz now they have a team and usually do these things abroad where security isnt the best like breaking into their hotels while theyre practicing and and posting pics touching their stuff and trying to start dating rumors and then when ppl try to debunk they leak secret footage of xyz talking to them during private times taken by their ssg accomplice, like a hidden camera, like when xyz is alone walking on the street etc. Like my ncts boys went through hell cause of them. So the second option is to ignore and even be more stern with them cause all they can do is say hes an asshole and shit talk him but thats better than feeding into their delusions. I have more c ssg anecdotes so lemme know if u want more like how they function and I cant see how thats split personality or w.e i just think rickys know when to interact and when not to. I hope the gyuriwook thing is true tho i need more of them</p>

      <p>okay well before i move on lemme just say i aint no angel, like im nosey and i lurk deep thats y i know these things ðŸ˜­ for zb1 i only know about hao and rickys relationship with cssgs and their cssgs gc so im only gonna talk about that but for the most part its true how hao is nice to ssgs all the time but ricky is 'selective' but it goes deep like back in bp. Hao for the most part has the most cssg obv but cssgs are notorious for being akgaes and during bp they made up a lot of rumors about other trainees and hanbin and ricky got the most of it. y cuz hanbin was threatening 1st and ricky was chinese and they didnt want another chinese to debut and cuz of wat happened with the chinese girl from gp. The rumors went from hanbin gf rumors, dating allin his fansite to ricky bad personality, doesnt get along with bp trainees, not chinese and that his family works for the us gov't and are traitors so they defected ðŸ˜­ it goes on but when ppl questioned the authenticity of it their proof was that theyre ssgs so ppl can trust them and ppl did because they were the ones to leak a lot of pre bp hao stuff so they were reliable but again because of that thats where these rumors start and spread and they could say anything and ppl would eat it up.

even now a lot of their cssgs in those group chat are haos mains from bp and a lot of them were anti ricky and when it comes to ricky they are the ones with split personality. After bp those akgaes became indifferent with ricky like they like him but at the same time hate him. y cuz their main prio is hao and cant stand when ricky gets opportunities and istg his insta and tiktok likes triggers tf outta them. So when they approach hao vs ricky its really different and if ur not chinese u wont understand but u can just tell by their tone and they post these in their cssg gc. Hao also acknowledges them whenever and whereever but ricky ignores them if they aint supposed to be there and that too triggers them because theyd compare him to hao but rmb their tones when talking between the two are different. also theres like different group of cssg from lvl of crazy, some just follow them to schedules and on the plane and imo i know this sounds crazy but they kinda normal in the ssg world, the ones that are bat shit crazy are the ones that not only follow them from country to country but camp outside their hotel and dorms 24/7. im not joking. but im reaching limit so reply so i can type more</p>

      <p>the ones walking at the airport with him weren't even ssgs except for like 2 or 3 of them cuz most couldnt get visas and most dont go unless hao/ group is there too and if u go on their weibo/ xhs they're all local to cali even that fan site that took professional pics theyre a jungkook stan but they always buy info when kpop idols come to LAX and they go there to take pics and the pics and vids u of him walking were from fans in public spaces after he came out from the arrivals area. But the ssgs that flew with him hate him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ also before i move on, im a rosin and it may sound like i hate ricky but i don't the cssgs do and all they ever do is complain about him in the gc so im just relaying it here. The 2-3 cssgs that went with him said the manager u saw with ricky in korea didn't go with him to LA he just dropped him off at the airport and left when ricky went into customs and he went by himself on the plane and got picked up by someone that works for his family or something they couldn't really tell cuz it wasnt an uber but at the same time he wasnt family because he was holding a card with ricky's name on it and he said his name to ricky before ricky gave him his luggage, I guess to confirm hes the right person but ricky seemed to trust him after that so thats why they say worker for the family. i went back and looked at the fan vids and the ssgs are right ricky came out to the arrival area pushing his own luggage and then gave it to the family worker. those 3 are ricky ssgs tho not hao ssgs but theyre in the same gc and the reason they hate him is because he always ignores them but as soon as he sees local fans hell say hi and they were fuming at the local fans because they kept complimenting him telling him to be happy talking bout cny and ricky would smile and say thanks. this may sound bad but also a good thing but a lot of his hardcore crazy cssgs dropped him after they went to thailand because they really hate it when he ignores them but says hi to local fans when they spent all this money following him its so ridiculous that thats their mentality tbh.

o and one main thing to tell the difference between local and ssgs are local fans talk aloott they say hi and compliment the idols but ssgs just quietly film and try to walk next to them. its really creepy if u see real ssg videos because its just silence but the camera is like a few feet away from their face but the ssgs that followed him this time arent that cray cray from the stuff i seen they shared they just fly to see him for kr schedules and get on the same plane but then the cssgs pitch in together for their hotel then get back on the plane when he leaves. Also they broke ðŸ˜­ in the gc they always try to find the cheapest plane tickets and places to stay its kinda funny,

the batshit crazy ones are the rich and nothing to do ones cause the amount of shit they get away with legally is insane also im at limit agian</p>

Oh wow thank u sis I'm gonna need the constant relating from these c ssgs I like hearing the things they say. THEYRE BROKE? Wow they just got the time cuz clearly they dgaf thank u anonðŸ˜Œ
