      <p>The only sasaeng that girl talks to is allin who only cares ab hanbin and stalks him and it's not like they're friends they're probably bothering that psycho thinking they're on tea but they just hate gunwook like what fuckinf exðŸ˜­ a hanbin sasaeng wouldn't know anything ab that these types of things are exposed by ppl that are already close to the members hence gyuvin and yujin their old friends/classmates/even the girls themselves exposed it an ex would have to have come from gunwooks circle they're waffling
