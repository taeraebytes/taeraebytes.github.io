      <p>anton taesan and leehan would have been a better trio if they wanted to do a rookie male mc trio bc they’re stan attractors, the same age, and it wouldn’t b awkward bc they’re close friends (at least anton and taesan are) bc anton was originally prob gonna debut in bnd so he trained w them for a year or so. the current mcd trio doesn’t work bc hanbin is a boomer in a 22 year old body, sohee is a middle schooler with 0 thoughts going through his head, and myungjae is a 5 year old running on 3 cans of red bull. taesan anton hanbin honestly would’ve made a bit more sense (i see why they picked that trio for the christmas stage now) but it would also be awkward bc taesan and anton are close and hanbin would have a weird parental role bc of the age gap</p>
