      <p>Idk about sales but it is true that Hanbin is the member with the most viral tweets over there lately. But he's the only one with public schedules lately (except for Zhang Hao but why would jfans care about an OST).</p>

      <p>He's always been the 4th most popular in jp after minasangz (Hao gunwook Matthew). Just that Haobin is always after those 3 before hanbin. 

Ricky I feel is the one where you have so many hit tweets in Japan right now because of his style and all like I literally saw 1.5m views of jp tweets for Ricky or just honestly so many hit tweets regarding his looks which is technically what is always happening to him lmao

He's just the Stan attractor</p>

      <p>It's interesting that Ricky gets the most hit tweets articles etc from non fans in the intl, japanese and even Chinese and Korean fandom but doesn't really have a strong solo fandom</p>

      <p>I rlly wonder why that is I haven't seen something like this before you'd think he'd have token stans or the most akgaes in the group because of it

      <p>i was gonna say it's similar to yunjin and ningning but now that i think about it maybe not?? at least not now, they possibly were like this in the past. they felt tokenised a while back but now i think those 2 developed a bigger fandom or at least ningning did. chaewon and sakura stans are probably still more dedicated bc they were also part of another big group (multiple groups in sakura's case) before lsf. i feel like i've seen ricky/his stans be compared to bahiyyih/her stans which is obnoxious but idk if i've seen that really come into play</p>

      <p>Ning definitely still has a lot of casuals cuz you'd think she was on par with winrina and she doesn't even outdo on the international front meanwhile yunjin lowkey garnered a fandom probably because of her freedom and work outside of lsfm but hmm yea

      <p>the only idol who actually changed the industry being wonyoung bc she‚Äôs making it possible for companies to sue ppl not located in korea but kpop stan‚Äôs hate her. like sure shes not a good singer, dancer, or performer, but if u deep it she‚Äôs kinda the textbook definition of an idol also it doesn‚Äôt excuse massive harassment/hate train she‚Äôs had since she was 13.</p>

      <p>Exactly. She's THE idol. Like literally. She just had that IT factor that can make you say she's an idol. And she can also make everyone who works with her look good with her</p>
