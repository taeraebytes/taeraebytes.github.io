      <p>I'm here but lol there's no tea. Btw I don't feel like sklen is ssfans, yeah she buys flight information and flies with them acting like a maniac at the airport but those are all times when they have schedules. . I only know what they talk about in c ssfans gc and they are all clearly delulu  anf mainly care about the three members, Hao Ricky and Yujin obviously.  Hao: Hao jesusto them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don't talk bad about him but he's not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that's the perfect way to communicate with ssfan.
 Ricky, if he's in a public place or on a schedule, he'll interact, otherwise he'll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol, they say he's either too cocky about his family background so he's arrogant or he likes richer fans so he treats them like that. They were serious about Yujin dating, even paying his classmates to see if he talked to any girls at school. ZB1 isn't too close, they hang out more in groups, Gunwook usually hangs out with Gyuvin and Ricky is a plus one but recently he's gotten closer with Matthew but everyone knows that lol.</p>

      <p>ouuuuu I feel like there's hella inconsistencies with Ricky's personality there's times where people say he's arrogant and times where he looks and acts like a kicked puppy and they're probably both genuine reactions it's just interesting how different they are. I know some girls that are heavy into cent and understand Chinese and lurk weibo they said some ex-yh trainees and even debuted celebs made a few anecdotal posts on weibo anonymously ab Ricky pretty early into bp saying they hated him and such and such. They were pretty much saying every Chinese yh trainee is like rich as fuck and they all have certain types of personalities and Ricky was probably super shitty if they all hated him but I was like if rich abysmal ppl all hate one dude they can't be that innocent eitherðŸ˜­ idk how true this is considering I was under the impression Ricky trained under yh korea but some ppl said even if Chinese trainees were under the kr division they still interacted and were grouped with the Chinese trainees the most. Plus someone was saying it's part of the reason he was never considered for boyhood(?) boystory(?) idfk cuz they never got along well except for that one boy. Also side note I want gyuriwook and Matthew to be a little friend group they get along well

      <p>not anon and ngl c ssg groups are notorious for shit talking idols if they don't get things their way and it shows from wat anon said cuz how is he cocky for wanting to protect his fams priviacy ðŸ˜­ like these bitches stalking him at night and think hell give them handshakes???? idk but as an ex nct and bts stan and as a chinese myself who goes on weibo/ baidu i hate c ssgs the most because if u interact with them where they shouldnt be they become mad delusional, thinking theyre special and thats where they truly become demons. They start missions in their ssg group chat and escalates the level batshit crazy cuz now they have a team and usually do these things abroad where security isnt the best like breaking into their hotels while theyre practicing and and posting pics touching their stuff and trying to start dating rumors and then when ppl try to debunk they leak secret footage of xyz talking to them during private times taken by their ssg accomplice, like a hidden camera, like when xyz is alone walking on the street etc. Like my ncts boys went through hell cause of them. So the second option is to ignore and even be more stern with them cause all they can do is say hes an asshole and shit talk him but thats better than feeding into their delusions. I have more c ssg anecdotes so lemme know if u want more like how they function and I cant see how thats split personality or w.e i just think rickys know when to interact and when not to. I hope the gyuriwook thing is true tho i need more of them</p>

<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hankyute/video/7334104191943593218">https://www.tiktok.com/@hankyute/video/7334104191943593218</a> not nct related but it is idol reputation related, this reminds me of that tiktok i saw yesterday (linked) of this girl saying a female idol fatshamed her friend and the girl group are known for being drama queens on set ðŸ˜­ the comments are kind of annoying bc it just feels like ppl naming popular female idols they think are 'pick mes' in typical kpop fashion but lowkey i get the gidle comments bc i remember the queencard mv had lots of extras, pretty sure lots were foreigners and it'd be a bit of a gag considering the themes of their songs</p>

      <p>a commenter said that it is likely gidle because they found the instagram of the tiktok op and saw that one of their foreign model friends based in korea recently was on the queencard set so yeah. a comment speculated that it was shuhua and honestly i wouldnâ€™t be surprised</p>
