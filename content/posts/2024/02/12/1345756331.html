      <p>I'm here but lol there's no tea. Btw I don't feel like sklen is ssfans, yeah she buys flight information and flies with them acting like a maniac at the airport but those are all times when they have schedules. . I only know what they talk about in c ssfans gc and they are all clearly delulu  anf mainly care about the three members, Hao Ricky and Yujin obviously.  Hao: Hao jesusto them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don't talk bad about him but he's not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that's the perfect way to communicate with ssfan.
 Ricky, if he's in a public place or on a schedule, he'll interact, otherwise he'll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol, they say he's either too cocky about his family background so he's arrogant or he likes richer fans so he treats them like that. They were serious about Yujin dating, even paying his classmates to see if he talked to any girls at school. ZB1 isn't too close, they hang out more in groups, Gunwook usually hangs out with Gyuvin and Ricky is a plus one but recently he's gotten closer with Matthew but everyone knows that lol.</p>

      <p>ouuuuu I feel like there's hella inconsistencies with Ricky's personality there's times where people say he's arrogant and times where he looks and acts like a kicked puppy and they're probably both genuine reactions it's just interesting how different they are. I know some girls that are heavy into cent and understand Chinese and lurk weibo they said some ex-yh trainees and even debuted celebs made a few anecdotal posts on weibo anonymously ab Ricky pretty early into bp saying they hated him and such and such. They were pretty much saying every Chinese yh trainee is like rich as fuck and they all have certain types of personalities and Ricky was probably super shitty if they all hated him but I was like if rich abysmal ppl all hate one dude they can't be that innocent eitherðŸ˜­ idk how true this is considering I was under the impression Ricky trained under yh korea but some ppl said even if Chinese trainees were under the kr division they still interacted and were grouped with the Chinese trainees the most. Plus someone was saying it's part of the reason he was never considered for boyhood(?) boystory(?) idfk cuz they never got along well except for that one boy. Also side note I want gyuriwook and Matthew to be a little friend group they get along well

      <p>Hao is by far the most intelligent person in that group, even the other members that I consider pretty smart leave me dumbfounded some times but he's pretty consistent. However it does raise the question, if something comes out about him (lol) the fall might be the most violent out of everyone esp considering he's Chinese and queer, obv if he's gonna date only men he does have an advantage (probably never getting any big dating rumors) but even something like hanging out with his female friends could set out his schizos, no way he can be on guard all the time...Yujin and Ricky could have dedicated ex ssngs antis like Jiwoong if they have another dating rumors, bad attitude controversy, it wouldn't surprise me at all</p>

      <p>Yea hao would probably have the worst fall out out of all the members it's why he's so careful but he's human he'll make mistakes or want to do things but considering he's very fair and consistent with his treatment maybe his crazies will feel bad and keep it quiet some do

      <p>He's not that smart but what i should say.. he's more lucky. He already outed by his anti since Jan 1st, they Made a whole thread about him (this is also why yh drop him). Back in February someone posted about him singing in his campus in every kforum with "a ccp singer" as a title (he got many hate from three, the article even still the most engagement on Instiz). Bbosonge posted 2 pictures of him and said he's gay and pinkboy di a Livestream said zh was a sl*t, a ons guy, "a poor boy who earn money from prostitute" back in april. In zb1, he has a "low university" allegation, hate for being confident, loud and even silent.. so yeah what else Will be his "if something comes out about him"?

for dating, it's a different thing.. when you are dating and you know your company won't back you up means you are ready for your early retirement (unless you date a relevant one)</p>

      <p>This is why krosins are the most delulu ive seen since everyone of them is a gf stan. 

But yeah he already received every story you can get and he still got more popular after that lmao so it's really funny how things work with Hao. 

He's very smart though in a way that he knows what fans want. Because with how many sasaengs he had, you mean to tell me no one actually had any tea about him lol</p>

      <p>I was on space with some and lotus asked if hao is gay and they screamed at usðŸ˜­ they kept saying hao likes girls they're so funny but yea he's smart and his fandom got strengthened AFTER the fact so they don't care it's different if everything got exposed now
