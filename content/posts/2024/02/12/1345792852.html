And all the information staffs said about Ricky is quite good so I don't think he has personality problems. I used to follow another female idol and ssf hated her to the core and said the male idols said bad things about her, they felt like saying that would justify them saying bad things about her...Like if your oppas talk shit about a teenage girl behind her back then your oppa is the fucking problem, so I only listen to the members' actions and make my own judgement, teenage beef and comments from delulu fans doesn't mean anything to me. I feel like the whole group's ssf dropped sharply, it peaked around the time they first debuted and was in Jeju for a bit but has since died down.

      <p>I'm here but lol there's no tea. Btw I don't feel like sklen is ssfans, yeah she buys flight information and flies with them acting like a maniac at the airport but those are all times when they have schedules. . I only know what they talk about in c ssfans gc and they are all clearly delulu  anf mainly care about the three members, Hao Ricky and Yujin obviously.  Hao: Hao jesusto them, he is good enough to his ssfans that they don't talk bad about him but he's not close to them either, simply ignore them or wave his hand, politely refuse when they come near and that's the perfect way to communicate with ssfan.
 Ricky, if he's in a public place or on a schedule, he'll interact, otherwise he'll ignore you or glaring at the camera. He rarely goes out and one time they followed him while he was walking or something like that in the middle of the night so he looked straight at the camera and asked them what they were doing, not even looking at them which made them so f mad lol, they say he's either too cocky about his family background so he's arrogant or he likes richer fans so he treats them like that. They were serious about Yujin dating, even paying his classmates to see if he talked to any girls at school. ZB1 isn't too close, they hang out more in groups, Gunwook usually hangs out with Gyuvin and Ricky is a plus one but recently he's gotten closer with Matthew but everyone knows that lol.</p>

      <p>ouuuuu I feel like there's hella inconsistencies with Ricky's personality there's times where people say he's arrogant and times where he looks and acts like a kicked puppy and they're probably both genuine reactions it's just interesting how different they are. I know some girls that are heavy into cent and understand Chinese and lurk weibo they said some ex-yh trainees and even debuted celebs made a few anecdotal posts on weibo anonymously ab Ricky pretty early into bp saying they hated him and such and such. They were pretty much saying every Chinese yh trainee is like rich as fuck and they all have certain types of personalities and Ricky was probably super shitty if they all hated him but I was like if rich abysmal ppl all hate one dude they can't be that innocent eitherðŸ˜­ idk how true this is considering I was under the impression Ricky trained under yh korea but some ppl said even if Chinese trainees were under the kr division they still interacted and were grouped with the Chinese trainees the most. Plus someone was saying it's part of the reason he was never considered for boyhood(?) boystory(?) idfk cuz they never got along well except for that one boy. Also side note I want gyuriwook and Matthew to be a little friend group they get along well
