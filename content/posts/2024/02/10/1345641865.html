      <p>Feel like unless a manager say to Hao that he's able to do it he don't do it. Since there's a manager with the 5, they can do it if they asked the manager but Hao doesn't have one</p>

      <p>Feel like he's been saying this even when he's on BP so it's probably a Yuehua directed instructions as I also haven't seen any signatures from both Gyuvin and Yujin and even rk</p>

      <p>Gunwook too I saw one where he signed a paper (?) or on a phone like a drawing but not either of the Yuehuaz so it's definitely something Yuehua asked them to do since 3/5 already signed for other fans and no way the other two won't do it if they were allowed.</p>
