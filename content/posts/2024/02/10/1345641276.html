      <p>Feel like unless a manager say to Hao that he's able to do it he don't do it. Since there's a manager with the 5, they can do it if they asked the manager but Hao doesn't have one</p>

      <p>Feel like he's been saying this even when he's on BP so it's probably a Yuehua directed instructions as I also haven't seen any signatures from both Gyuvin and Yujin and even rk</p>
