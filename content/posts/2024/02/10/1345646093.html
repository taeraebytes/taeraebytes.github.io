      <p>He doesn't even lip sync sometimes so when it's his part and no one's singing, it's so funny. That's why you always see posts saying woah I can clearly hear this member or that member since those members are usually the only ones they can hear sing live</p>

      <p>I always laugh when that part in crush comes up cause taerae just did the bridge and high note flawlessly before, even for award shows he went octave higher, then right next is gyuvin who cant even do his small part live , theres also a festival where his chemical party part on nkotb he was joking with yujin and laughed the whole way through bruhðŸ’€</p>
