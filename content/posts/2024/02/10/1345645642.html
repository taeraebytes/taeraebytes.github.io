      <p>it was obvious wakeone was not going terminate his contract or put him on a hiatus. we will see the downsides of them not clarifying the issue when its time for a korean comeback/korean concerts. i hope intl zeroses dont blame kfans for not cheering, cause im sure that most of them wont cheer for him. kfans already dont like him or never liked him and now this thing is going to follow zb1 until they disband. kfans will be pissed if article mention jiwoongs issue or if the issue is getting more attention while they are having a comeback.</p>
