      <p>on the other sites they said he was #1 the sales aren't shown you can rank the solo editions but they change everyday since it's not over yet. the only site where you can properly see the sales is ktown jp but he's not #1 ðŸ˜•</p>

      <p>thinking gunwook is flopping in japan is hilarious these websites switch ranks every day, it is funny how all these accounts post these ranks of their faves' only specific days when magically that number one alligns with their faves having that spot for the day</p>

      <p>I try to tell these folks sales don't equate to anything especially when theirs different purchasing powers with each member hao and hanbin are the most expensive and sell out the fastest where I live and neither are #1 and #2 in America but yea everyone who puts the #1 just puts it whej it finally aligns it doesn't actually translate thoðŸ˜­

      <p>No one's even that popular for zb1 on us based on purchasing power. Ricky might be the most recognized but doesn't even translate to sales which is why zb1 is so nugu lmao since most rk fans are casuals. And he's the only one that's actually popular in us.</p>

      <p>Who do you think is the most popular in America I'm curious? I was in mcd paris and I assumed Ricky-Hao were the most popular and then maybe Hanbin or Matthew and then Gunwook probably? I assumed it was the same in America (I guess Ricky number 1 at least?)</p>
