 they went to japan. matthews gonna get them into trouble ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i get wanting to be nice to fans when you meet them on the street but if he keeps doing that fans will be more likely to stalk him since he doesnt turn them down</p>

      <p>I get that but it's rude not to as well so you can't win here also this just promotes more respectful greetings I feel like I barely see ppl just go up and say hi which celebs usually find nice

      <p>Japanese fans are a very respectful and polite theres a reason why j-sasaengs dont exist and matthew is defo the most popular there rn a lot of ppl said they saw him and only mentioned speaking or waving at him lol, maybe he was just a bit more sociable too</p>

      <p>I rmbr so vividly the girls that kept breaking into bts hotels were JAPANESEðŸ˜­ like jsasaengs get shit done I'd rank them above ksasaengs and they get a handicap for living in the country idols promote and live in and yea matthews just the easiest to approach
