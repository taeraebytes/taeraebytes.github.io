      <p>on the other sites they said he was #1 the sales aren't shown you can rank the solo editions but they change everyday since it's not over yet. the only site where you can properly see the sales is ktown jp but he's not #1 ðŸ˜•</p>

      <p>thinking gunwook is flopping in japan is hilarious these websites switch ranks every day, it is funny how all these accounts post these ranks of their faves' only specific days when magically that number one alligns with their faves having that spot for the day</p>

      <p>I try to tell these folks sales don't equate to anything especially when theirs different purchasing powers with each member hao and hanbin are the most expensive and sell out the fastest where I live and neither are #1 and #2 in America but yea everyone who puts the #1 just puts it whej it finally aligns it doesn't actually translate thoðŸ˜­

      <p>Not from sales but I'm mostly on jzerosestwt a lot and my subjective impression is also that they're very majoritarily either Hao or Gunwook fan, Matthew used to be comparable popularity wise during BP but I don't see a lot of his fans nowadays even though he might be the third most popular, Ricky has always pretty constantly gotten viral posts but I don't think his fandom is super strong either imo it's Hao then Gunwook then Matthew and Haobin then Hanbin then Ricky</p>

      <p>It's because haobinist is separate from rosins and Allins lmao. You never see rosins and Allins voting for Haobin on a duo poll. I've literally had so many people see tweeting saying they thought Haobin is one person. They're really like THE DUO and no solos can erase it lmao</p>
