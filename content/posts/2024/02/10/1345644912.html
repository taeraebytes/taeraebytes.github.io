      <p>it was obvious wakeone was not going terminate his contract or put him on a hiatus. we will see the downsides of them not clarifying the issue when its time for a korean comeback/korean concerts. i hope intl zeroses dont blame kfans for not cheering, cause im sure that most of them wont cheer for him. kfans already dont like him or never liked him and now this thing is going to follow zb1 until they disband. kfans will be pissed if article mention jiwoongs issue or if the issue is getting more attention while they are having a comeback.</p>

      <p>Anon thats not true at all majority of k-zeroses 
,not just troll / solo stan / casuals but the actual ot9 ones are on his side , also when it comes for cheering kfans only cheer for whoever they bias unlike intl fans , yes it will negatively affect the group because knetz will bring it up in relation to any zb1 news thats a fact</p>

      <p>They have no choice but to support since Wakeone already said it's not him. The only issue now is if they'll actually support the boys next comeback or not.</p>

      <p>We'll see the issue will probably be lowkey forgotten by the time they have their korean cb and it's prob why wakeone feels so confident in playing the silent game
