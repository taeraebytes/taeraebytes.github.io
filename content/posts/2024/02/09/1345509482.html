It's quite easy to see which members are close, Hanbin for example only drew a big heart for Gyuvin, 2 small hearts for Matthew and one small heart for Gunwook, and today he's travelling with these 3 + Yujin 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>Tbf we know he's actually really close w Hao (much than w Yujin or Gunwook) but you wouldn't guess from this drawing, it's just obvious that Taerae is closer to evnne, Ricky only to the maknar and Jiwoong is out</p>
