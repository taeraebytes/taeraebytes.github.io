      <p>LMAOO????? But it's smart of them to go to Japan before their Japan debut, get some Japanese clout with the locals and solidify their Japanese fanbase because I know when idols go to foreign countries, fans in that country feel more appreciated/ included if that makes sense. Like when ZB1 came LA I liked them 2x more just because we were breathing the same air and they spoke english  ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I get there's a stigma but again japan is not just for that it's a real place people vacation and work atðŸ˜­ they're not going 5 members deep with a minor and vlog cams tl go do that and usually u can tell what kinda person goes there for that no one gives me those vibes. And same just being within 100 feet of them made me love them to death it's crazy
