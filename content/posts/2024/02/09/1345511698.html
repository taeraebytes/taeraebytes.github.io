      <p>Did you watch Ricky's Newsen departure video? It seems like they got a new manager because I never seen him before and dude was literally in tears because of the camera flashes XDDD I wonder if he's in charge of Ricky specifically though because Wakeone has to know that every time fans see the other two managers beside Ricky they get pissed and ask why they aint fired yet.</p>

      <p>Yea I saw and riyangis were being weird af talking ab look how nice and caring like they overanalyze any person that comes into contact with Ricky like he's a victim to everything omgjfjjsjfjejjdjd and the guy was dragging Ricky arounf like a child it was hard to watch the videos that was not cute ðŸ˜­ but seeing as how riyangis don't even respect Ricky as a person no wonder they're lit over that but lol yea that guy must be a rookie manager. The sad thing is the fat guy with hair actually seems to b nice to Ricky and didn't do anything
