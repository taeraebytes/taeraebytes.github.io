      <p>on the other sites they said he was #1 the sales aren't shown you can rank the solo editions but they change everyday since it's not over yet. the only site where you can properly see the sales is ktown jp but he's not #1 😕</p>

      <p>this and just because a member reached “sold out” status first doesn’t mean they had the highest number of sales. it’s common for sites to stock more popular members with more stocks, which also means they might not become “sold out” as fast as the members with less stocks. 

for example on ktown4u japan currently zhang hao’s solo edition is sold out at 80 sales, whereas hanbin’s solo edition is sold out at 50 sales and yujin’s solo edition is sold out at 8 sales. in this scenario yujin probably “sold out” quickest but that doesn’t mean he had the highest sales
