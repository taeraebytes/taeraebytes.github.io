      <p>I get that but it's rude not to as well so you can't win here also this just promotes more respectful greetings I feel like I barely see ppl just go up and say hi which celebs usually find nice

      <p>Japanese fans are a very respectful and polite theres a reason why j-sasaengs dont exist and matthew is defo the most popular there rn a lot of ppl said they saw him and only mentioned speaking or waving at him lol, maybe he was just a bit more sociable too</p>

      <p>this is what my issue with matthew 😭 he mentioned on his bbl live that if they saw him in real life just always approach him and say hi or hello to him like bruh i never saw an idol be open with this fans so much like he trust these “fans” so much. i wish that he get to be humbled.

      <p>UGH U GUYS JUST DO TOO MUCH😭 like he's just being sweet matthew is a kind person and it's obv it's coming from the fact he doesn't get approached in korea where he is 95% of the time cuz there's barely any kseokryus he was probably so happy that one girl he met at the art store was a huge fan and he wants to experience that again like goddamn and he's naturally just a very sweet and approachable person so he would love to meet fans
