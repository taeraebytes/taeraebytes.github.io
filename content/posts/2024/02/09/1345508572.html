      <p>i saw tweets being shady, saying to sasaengs to stop stalking ricky while he's on holiday but with no specifics, were there sasaengs in la stalking him????? ðŸ˜­ i saw press and fansite like pics of him when he was at the airport in korea and found that so odd since hao was spotted at the airport too but it just looked like one of those phone pics ppl take when they unintentionally spot a celebrity</p>
