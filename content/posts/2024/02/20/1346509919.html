      <p>Aren't you the same whore who made the Vinricky account to harass Yujin on Mnet Plus? And a huge hate campaign against Yujin on Pannchao because your favorite was not the group's maknae? You have an odd fetish for viewing your favorite as Maknae, right?

I have proof with a screenshot your account has been taged to those accounts. How about you stick to loving your favorites and stop pestering other members, especially underage members?</p>
