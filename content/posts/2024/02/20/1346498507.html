      <p>They will never ever let him go idk what it is but also I don't think any other group would kick out a member for this except some big4

      <p>which is why the big4 is superior and have succesful groups. they wouldnt even be in this mess. they wouldve made their idol apologize and put them on a hiatus. i dont get how smaller companies think they can get away with things/not even apologizing</p>

      <p>I don't like big4 just cuz they're basically kpop monopolies and they're not that amazing either they just have the funds and staff to make better choices

      <p>Honestly they're just damn good at pr, look at the way they handled mingyu and hyunjin's scandals. Those two were only able to save their careers because their companies knew how to handle it well</p>
