      <p>There were about already news articles saying that the reason why hma was talked about is because of Jiwoong (the fan fight and that someone said Jiwoong leave)</p>

      <p>man i felt so bad for ricky cuz i was on twt all day yesterday watching everything unfold and knets were shitting on jiwoongs bbl messages dragging tf outa him and then out of fucking no where he decides that was the best time to post a duo selfie ðŸ’€ saw a few ppl tried to drag ricky into the drama on instiz but it seems like knets are solely hating on jiwoong, his stans and zeroses who do defend him. like non zeroses were telling them to stop bringing in the other members who had nothing to do with it and even complimenting and feeling sorry for ricky cuz why tf is he posting a duo selfie amidst the drama knowing knets are after him, either he cluelcess or it was intentional. I noticed knets did that too with gunwook, taerae and matthew when some knets tried to drag them into jiwoongs drama too. I guess thats the good news</p>
