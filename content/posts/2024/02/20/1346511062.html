      <p>They will never ever let him go idk what it is but also I don't think any other group would kick out a member for this except some big4

      <p>what's crazy is i don't even remember the seunghan scandal getting this much engagement even tho it felt so much bigger imo, like i thought nothing would top that for these new idols... but yeah wow this is terrible. i wonder what's in it for us in the future now that this has happened :/</p>

      <p>This feels 10x bigger and it's that way because of how wakeone is handling it versus how seunghan handled and seunghan didn't even cuss and he apologized and did a "voluntary" hiatus I don't think it was fully his choice but it was swift and clean

      <p>It's basically because of the response of Wakeone, his fans and jw himself.

They made it so much bigger</p>

      <p>Yup they honestly could've handled this much better issues a private apology and compensation a statement about reflection and a public apology and not only would zb1 have exposure this wouldn't be a problem anymore

      <p>does he have like...... no self awareness? surely when typing he saw what he was writing like as soon as i saw the bubble translations i knew just how big and bad this would get - though i didn't think there'd be multiple korean tweets with 20k+ rts ngl - since idols basically never do stuff like this when in a scandal (i can't think of specific examples but the exception to this would be idols pointing out hate that very clearly is not warranted. this jiwoong situation is different since it's so "did he say it? did he not say it?" and wakeone's response was meh so it just looks terrible. imo it'd be cringe even if he was free of the shibal allegations but it wouldn't be this bad) and HE'S the one with his finger on the trigger ðŸ˜­ like if i was him i just would've stayed silent for a bit, that's what he did before anyway</p>
