      <p>They will never ever let him go idk what it is but also I don't think any other group would kick out a member for this except some big4

      <p>which is why the big4 is superior and have succesful groups. they wouldnt even be in this mess. they wouldve made their idol apologize and put them on a hiatus. i dont get how smaller companies think they can get away with things/not even apologizing</p>

      <p>I don't like big4 just cuz they're basically kpop monopolies and they're not that amazing either they just have the funds and staff to make better choices

      <p>Honestly they're just damn good at pr, look at the way they handled mingyu and hyunjin's scandals. Those two were only able to save their careers because their companies knew how to handle it well</p>

      <p>I think the difference that alot of anons arenâ€™t taking into account is that all of these idol scandals being mentioned in this cc happened before these people were famous and when they were a lot younger. It was easier to mange with good pr because itâ€™s not like the fans were experiencing it or it was a current issue. Itâ€™s not the same in this case this is a current issue and it involves a fan so thatâ€™s why fans / knetz are more full on about this than other issues.</p>

      <p>Mingyu it happened at the beginning of svts rise and they were already very popular within kpop fans he wasn't a rookie at all. And ngl hyunjins rep was ruined forever he was supposed to be the member for the Korean market and they couldn't even start breaking into it until 2023 and kingdom barely helped plus they basically made their center felix after that
