      <p>Better not rosins see this cc because they were altering Yujin's pic with shit emoji and abusing him. They are some of the most immature and rude fans I've ever seen, which is why I don't like ZB1. I used to love hao, but not anymore. I'm happy stanning Lun8.</p>

      <p>The way that account who edited that shit emoji was actually a 3 follower account who also likes faker and LOL ðŸ’€ atleast don't be too obvious that you still follow zb1 since that account who edited that is a 3 follower account ðŸ˜¶</p>
