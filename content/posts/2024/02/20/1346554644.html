      <p>ok honestly you guys make it seem like karina looks so inhumane she rlly doesn't the ai visual just gets enhanced from makeup and editing. I was looking at past photos recently and honestly her jaws always kind of looked like that I'm sure there was tweaking but I think giselles the only one who did an actual jaw shave
