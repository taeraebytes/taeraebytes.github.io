      <p>which is why the big4 is superior and have succesful groups. they wouldnt even be in this mess. they wouldve made their idol apologize and put them on a hiatus. i dont get how smaller companies think they can get away with things/not even apologizing</p>

      <p>I don't like big4 just cuz they're basically kpop monopolies and they're not that amazing either they just have the funds and staff to make better choices
