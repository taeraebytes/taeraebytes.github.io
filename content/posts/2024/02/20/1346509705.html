      <p>what i could gather was just that it sounded like really harmful rumours about the members from the way everything else in the tweets was worded. i lowkey don't think the expose account should've tweeted those screenshots as it draws more attention/curiosity to those rumours (u can't tell the specifics, tho u can make guesses, but yeah ygwim) but i guess i also get it, it's to show how depraved they are and what lengths they go to 🤷‍♀️</p>
