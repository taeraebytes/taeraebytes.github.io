      <p>I think this has to do with the flight cancellation I said last week that it was definitely a schedule of some sort but everyone wanted to act like they were gonna snuff them and kill them in the basement and erase them from the group

      <p>This screenshot is a zb1 fan account not an actual source so idk why they are believing it ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m sorry but none of those boys are big enough for Milan fashion week. People have been saying this is what the cancellation is for but absolutely no company would allow 2 members to miss a comback/ debut for a fashion week and the timeline doesnâ€™t even match up because Milan fashion week is at the start of March and Japan debut is at the end so there would be no need to cancel tickets as they would never clash. Also they probably did re book tickets because this account is where everyone gets there info from and no one is excluded this time.

      <p>Milan fashion week didn't even come to mind I was thinking restaurant hopping XD? I'm just saying that whatever reason the flight got cancelled for is probably a schedule but nobody wanted to listen when I said that last week

      <p>I feel like ppl are just dramatic. Those two prob had visa issues so had to re book and then w1 was like might as well just rebook the entire zb1 because now all of them are going to japn together instead of zh and rk going separate. Also easier on staff since they don't have to separate them.</p>
