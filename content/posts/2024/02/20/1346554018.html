      <p>The fact that visuals like Karina are normalized is so scary no shade to her I like her but kpop is doing way too much with the jaw shaves we need to untrend that quick</p>

      <p>ok honestly you guys make it seem like karina looks so inhumane she rlly doesn't the ai visual just gets enhanced from makeup and editing. I was looking at past photos recently and honestly her jaws always kind of looked like that I'm sure there was tweaking but I think giselles the only one who did an actual jaw shave
