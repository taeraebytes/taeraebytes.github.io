      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>You're not that sane either, your cc is evidence enough of that, no one said hanbin should be center and no hao is not miles above hanbin in international popularity yall just want to believe that, and have you asked yourself why zb1 has no magazine covers since ages? And yes one of the reasons zb1 is not doing as well as projected is because of hao, yuehua and his c-fandom.</p>

      <p>What if I told you I was the sanest girl in the world 😳 ok but what were u getting at I'm just using past experiences and encounters this isn't the first time I've gotten a cc like this and almost always they're coming to one conclusion -> hao shouldn't be center and who advocates for that silently 🤔🤔 you know who I'm no rosin nor do I care ab the politics but I'm not dumb😭 believe what u want to believe about success I'm not the success professor😭 and magazines were being complained about by all sides of the fandom I for one am grateful the torture has stopped and again this sounds like more of a personal issue with hao than a fact because nobody has ever said that
