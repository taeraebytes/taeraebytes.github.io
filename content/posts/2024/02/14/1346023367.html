      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>You're not that sane either, your cc is evidence enough of that, no one said hanbin should be center and no hao is not miles above hanbin in international popularity yall just want to believe that, and have you asked yourself why zb1 has no magazine covers since ages? And yes one of the reasons zb1 is not doing as well as projected is because of hao, yuehua and his c-fandom.</p>

      <p>What if I told you I was the sanest girl in the world 😳 ok but what were u getting at I'm just using past experiences and encounters this isn't the first time I've gotten a cc like this and almost always they're coming to one conclusion -> hao shouldn't be center and who advocates for that silently 🤔🤔 you know who I'm no rosin nor do I care ab the politics but I'm not dumb😭 believe what u want to believe about success I'm not the success professor😭 and magazines were being complained about by all sides of the fandom I for one am grateful the torture has stopped and again this sounds like more of a personal issue with hao than a fact because nobody has ever said that

      <p>Mind you, I am just entertaining yall since I am kind of bored, and I am too grown-up to care to hate someone I've never met, hao is talented and beautiful and I hope he finds success wherever he goes, he deserved to be the center for debut and to get his solo song as promised but his fandom is making it hard for the company to explore more options, a rotational center for the later releases would be impossible simply because his fandom is crazy, I would not delve into geopolitics but if you do more research you'd know what hao's fanbase in Korea consists of, And you'd know why it could harm the group in the long way, and yuehua is definitely so involved with zb1 management way beyond what could be considered the norm, fun fact, they helped manage it one before, thanks.</p>

      <p>Wait I like u better with ur sanity hat on I think this too experimenting a little with centers would be cool and I quite literally have said that but again I wouldn't say his fandom is causing zb1s "downfall" because at the end of the day they're still doing what makes them mad crush basically was rotating centers and if they do it again they'll just do some damage control as they always do. I do believe crosins have a little power but not THAT much you're giving them too much credit and again I've acknowledged yuehuas involvement but I still think the biggest factor lies in the mismanagement
