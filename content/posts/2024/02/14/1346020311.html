      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>Dude the reason why zb1 flopped is because the songs are not good compared to others. If you actually checked tws sounds and zb1 streams, zb1 as a whole had more gp streams than them</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm so mad about wakeones timing for comebacks. Like they should have bumped crush up to October and done a January comeback and we actually would have won all the music shows</p>
