      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>1) you sound like a hanbin anti, 2) it’s unnecessary to mention a specific member, who is not even mentioned in the first place, and 3) what even got you so mad? 🤔</p>

      <p>context clues are a thing it's very obvious what this person was getting at 😭 and their reply basically confirmed that and their cc has very clear undertones of the type slick Sinophobic stuff a likkle demographic says and I just had to say that last piece cuz it's smth I've been meaning to say and I get irked when ppl try to downplay zb1s success why would Sinophobia be a factor and it's not like they're flopping either
