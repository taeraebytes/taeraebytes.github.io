      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>I think op is just saying that kr gp is still very much Sinophobic and in a way I agree that a lot of zb1 achievements have been downplayed or ignored by the media due to Sinophobia. People say it‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt from the big 4 but wanna one and izone were always in the news and zb1 is breaking just as many records yet kr media doesn‚Äôt talk about them.</p>

      <p>yea korea is still Sinophobic but in the kpop industry when country wide recognition basically no longer exists plus just social change it is not that bad anymore plus hanbin is still the most popular member in korea. Also zb1 even at their height didn't reacg a fraction of produce fame because survival shows have bad rep they've done impressive things with the state of their management and blowing up even with bad rep. And all of zb1s competitions are big4 and we're in an age where success is almost impossible without being big4
