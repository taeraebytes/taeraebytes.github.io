      <p>how can you and other anons say hao or the group doesnt get belittled by kmedia or other kpop fans for having two chinese members and most importantly a chinese center. if you actually cared about hao or liked him, you wouldnt deny that fact. there are sinophobic comments on almost all of his post (kforums) or people going "im not stanning zb1 bcs they have a chinese as a center". its a real thing hao and the group goes through. if hao were someone that had mid singing skills or dancing skills, he would be crucified on those korean platforms. he would get dragged alot more alongside jiwoongs name. just last week those kfans were trying to put the blame on hao for jiwoongs slip up, saying that the chinese mustve said it cause the korean member wouldnt talk like that. he is facing sinophobia</p>
