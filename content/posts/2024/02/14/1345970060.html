 the comments and qrts on this are giving mental illness, like yes there is hao mistreatment to be spoken about but actually being in the centre for things is not one of themðŸ˜­ out of all produce planet groups zb1 has the most strict formation I have ever seen even for their casual stuff like they need a reality check, centre erasure because Yujin is in the middle for 1 photo. They would have never survived had they pulled a xiaoting - chaehyun on Yujin and hao.</p>

      <p>Clock it like I get it but with how kpop has always been it's never going to be as strict as people want it to be. as long as the important things he's gettint center for and people recognize and acknowledge it that's basically the jobðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ you can apply this to other positions like main vocal sometimes someone who isn't will get a nicer line in a song that doesn't diminish the position
