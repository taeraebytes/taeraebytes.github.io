Cuz imagine it this was if everyone just sold regular ass albums either it would be only one store getting most of the sales or they're all sporadic and spaced out which is bad for profit so they all sell albums w unique pics fansigns don't always have to be attached for pobs to exist but because of covid and the rise of fancalls there's more and more pobs to keep the fans who don't get in interested"
