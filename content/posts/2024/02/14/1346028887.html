      <p>with the popularization of kpop i honestly expected all new idols to be super good at dancing/singing and looking like models but somehow they are getting worse each year ðŸ˜­ idk like now everybody and there mama wants to be an idol, is it really that hard to find some trainees that have it all esp for big4 companies</p>

      <p>the quality for talent has gone down the variety of visuals has gone down everyone's also rich so the personalities are a lot blander and worse this is why kpop is falling off now

      <p>kpop is like the fast fashion of music theyâ€™re just trying to churn out the most quantity as quickly as possible (thatâ€™s why the music and trend cycles are so damn short) and to do that they donâ€™t have time or patience to give idols actual training to be good performers and singers especially when most ppl just stan for visuals nowadays</p>

      <p>I've realized how much of a capitalist dystopia Kpop is when I noticed theres like maybe 3 actually GREAT full albums like there's like 1000+ groups  since the 80s how is the level of artistry that weak I could name you 15 great American albums from 2015-2017 alone</p>

      <p>kpop used to be somewhat unique even with their age old rip offs but now it's so repetitive it's crazyðŸ˜­
