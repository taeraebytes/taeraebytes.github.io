      <p>Like they're trying to convince us she's the biggest pop stars in the world but her numbers are so inflated and her popularity so forced like my family are middle eastern and live in Europe they know who MJ, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, CÃ©line Dion, Beyonce, Gaga are and several of their songs...they don't know who tf Taylor swift is or any of her songs like before I got twitter I knew nothing about her</p>
