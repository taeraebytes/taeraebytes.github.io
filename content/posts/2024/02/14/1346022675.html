      <p>My biggest irk as a Chinese person who doesn‚Äôt bias c-line is some of their fans (who aren‚Äôt Chinese) calling everything Sinophobia, like y‚Äôall have watered down that word so much to the point that actual cases of Sinophobia get washed over.</p>

      <p>These kpop stans learn a new word and apply it to everything because how are you talking over actual Chinese people and your justification being that you bias c-line. Like the Sinophobia I face or c-line faces will ultimately never touch them but they sure as hell act like it‚Äôs their problem.</p>
