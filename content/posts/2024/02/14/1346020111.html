      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>

      <p>sorry it's facts the racist people on twt are just perpetuating like they're racist kfans they wouldn't have acted like this on their own it's only evident in one kind of akgae space that rlllllly takes pride in korean standard and recognition that's why I say parasocial they're some serious larpers

      <p>righht i remember seeing “k in kpop stands for korean” coming from an int allin implying that only korean idols and fans really matter, they are also so obsessed with calling hb korea’s son/korea’s pride/nation’s pick and just imagine people from other country calling some midtier singer your nation’s pride i would be weirded out; 
also this is not related to allins but it’s so icky when kpop stans make whole accounts about rating idols on kbs, i promise you even koreans dgaf like that, if someone is pretty in their eyes they will call them pretty and won’t pull out a whole formula, kbooism mixed with racism is a widespread disease that really goes unchecked in int kpop fandom</p>
