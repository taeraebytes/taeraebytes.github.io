      <p>they are but they probably don’t know what is popular in terms of duos in Japan either way (except haobin of course cause that just works everywhere)</p>

      <p>Yea from what I've seen gunwooks popular duos are gunhao and riwook I'd assume mattwook are popular too since they're both popular but I don't rlly see jtweets ab them

      <p>I don't see a lot of rps I just see how they don't play ab their duos and lowkey riwook might be the biggest ship there for gunwook AND IM LITTTTT they call them uyuzu but haobin is universally the biggest ship
