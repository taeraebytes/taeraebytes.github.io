      <p>with the popularization of kpop i honestly expected all new idols to be super good at dancing/singing and looking like models but somehow they are getting worse each year ðŸ˜­ idk like now everybody and there mama wants to be an idol, is it really that hard to find some trainees that have it all esp for big4 companies</p>

      <p>the quality for talent has gone down the variety of visuals has gone down everyone's also rich so the personalities are a lot blander and worse this is why kpop is falling off now
