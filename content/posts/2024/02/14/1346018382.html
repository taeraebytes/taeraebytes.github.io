      <p>Let's be honest for now, rosins are the worst fandom to come out of the produce/planet franchise, and him winning center may have helped the group get more sales but has ruined the chances of the group becoming a gp pick in Korea, a group with a chinese center will never be a muggles pick, and while y'all think his popularity in China will translate to the members, I have news for you it will never happen, and one more thing how are his supertopic followers 3 times less than his sales? Like Karina got like more than 1m, winter too...</p>
