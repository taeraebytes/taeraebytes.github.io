      <p>The way sheâ€™s @ some accounts that havenâ€™t been active for months like why you @ them they ainâ€™t gonna see that ðŸ˜‚ seriously though youâ€™d think he was the only idol whose ever gone through any hardship with the way this was worded and no Iâ€™m not saying he has it easy or that itâ€™s ok but like calm yourself because even post disbandment do you think things like this will stop. Especially if he moves into c-ent and then itâ€™s rosins vs Chinese idols fandoms.</p>

      <p>WAllah there's so many rosins like that that's why I stopped identifying w the sf so fast I'm an ex barbz and army in my teenage years I can detect cult mentally ill behavior so fast now they've become just like allins at a larger number minus the racism it's actually comical</p>
