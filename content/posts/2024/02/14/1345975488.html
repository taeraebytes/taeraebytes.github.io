 the comments and qrts on this are giving mental illness, like yes there is hao mistreatment to be spoken about but actually being in the centre for things is not one of themðŸ˜­ out of all produce planet groups zb1 has the most strict formation I have ever seen even for their casual stuff like they need a reality check, centre erasure because Yujin is in the middle for 1 photo. They would have never survived had they pulled a xiaoting - chaehyun on Yujin and hao.</p>

      <p>Clock it like I get it but with how kpop has always been it's never going to be as strict as people want it to be. as long as the important things he's gettint center for and people recognize and acknowledge it that's basically the jobðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ you can apply this to other positions like main vocal sometimes someone who isn't will get a nicer line in a song that doesn't diminish the position

      <p>the way wakeone treats chaehyun is kinda baffling to me like their own trainee made it as the center of their group so shouldn't they be pushing her hard and getting all the opportunities they can?</p>

      <p>I'm gonna be straightforward it's not what I personally think of her but it's because she's not skinny enough and is insecure, xiaoting or Hikaru aren't particularly more talented than her but they're skinny and confident</p>

      <p>ouuu I do rmbr there were so many forums calling her fat in 2022 welll uhhhhh hikaru just brings the j market that Kepler relies on cuz let's be real her face is not cutting it and her confidence is just a plusðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ she can't be ragging on nobody either I heard her and dayeon say shady shit all the timeðŸ˜­ xiaoting was just bound to be the most loved and popular she's the prettiest too plus the confidence thing
