      <p>with the popularization of kpop i honestly expected all new idols to be super good at dancing/singing and looking like models but somehow they are getting worse each year ðŸ˜­ idk like now everybody and there mama wants to be an idol, is it really that hard to find some trainees that have it all esp for big4 companies</p>

      <p>the quality for talent has gone down the variety of visuals has gone down everyone's also rich so the personalities are a lot blander and worse this is why kpop is falling off now

      <p>you have to take it to account the fact that koreaâ€™s birth rate is tanking and therefore the talent pool is shrinking. now you have a bunch of pretty kids but thatâ€™s about it.</p>

      <p>I think the cost of living is also higher so middle class and average citizen interested in music aren't gonna risk it and be idols anymore like sunmi, iu etc so now you only have 14yo bored rich kids</p>
