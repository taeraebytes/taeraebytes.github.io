 the comments and qrts on this are giving mental illness, like yes there is hao mistreatment to be spoken about but actually being in the centre for things is not one of themðŸ˜­ out of all produce planet groups zb1 has the most strict formation I have ever seen even for their casual stuff like they need a reality check, centre erasure because Yujin is in the middle for 1 photo. They would have never survived had they pulled a xiaoting - chaehyun on Yujin and hao.</p>

      <p>Clock it like I get it but with how kpop has always been it's never going to be as strict as people want it to be. as long as the important things he's gettint center for and people recognize and acknowledge it that's basically the jobðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ you can apply this to other positions like main vocal sometimes someone who isn't will get a nicer line in a song that doesn't diminish the position

      <p>Iâ€™m ctfu ðŸ˜­ haoâ€™s situation is nothing like chaehyuns. Kepler routinely rotates centre and the fandom doesnâ€™t even blink and eye at it. People even say stuff like â€˜xiaoting perfect Center, hikaru perfect Centerâ€™ and no one says shit, now tell me if someone were to say the same in zerose town would the reaction be the same. Poor Yujin is getting crucified by rosins and c rosins right now over nothing</p>

      <p>Like at alllllllllllll not even close hao is valuable to wakeone and very popular it's not always going to be a strict strict thing that's not even common in kpop like if u guys want it to be like Kepler go on aheadðŸ˜­ like it's one jacket photo this is actually so dumb

      <p>okay this is just not true kepler twt is a mess every cb precisely cause they dont give chaehyun center a lot, which angers xiaoting akgaes and it goes on and on!! like ur underestimating a big reason why their fandom and supoort went to shit</p>

      <p>I'm sure there's arguments but it's so small and doesn't make it out the fandom
