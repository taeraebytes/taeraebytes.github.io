      <p>that acc is not even a rosin, they’re some faker (some gamer) fan with 3 followers. zeroses stop falling for setup accs challenge failed bruh. there’s so many ppl cosplaying as rosins lately to set us up goddd there’s a whole circle of fake rosins who put “@name’s backup” in their bio to pretend to be an actual rosin’s backup acc so they can infiltrate rosin’s circles and set us up, and when called out they block the ppl whom they’re pretending to be 😭 like why do rosins got a whole fandom of our own ugh stop being so obsessed with us 🙄 some days y’all hate us some days y’all love us but y’all will always need us… settle on a narrative</p>
