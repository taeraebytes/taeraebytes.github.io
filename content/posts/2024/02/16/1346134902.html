      <p>i rly wish hanbin would do more waacking stuff like ugh that's what sets him apart from other male idol dancers anyways  i get that theres pressure to conform But cmon. Obviously hes not gonna look better dancing click like or 3D next to matthew cus they have completely different stylesðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦
but i guess there's not enough viral waacking trends or choreos for him to ever show it off so whatever</p>

      <p>right like everyone says heâ€™s one of the best dancers in the gen and while i donâ€™t doubt that, heâ€™s not actually doing the genre that actually made him have that title. obv everyone knows he is a strong dancer even if he doesnâ€™t showcase those strengths but his hip hop skills are mediocre compared to other studio trained turned idol dancers (still very good but like matthew for ex is a better hip hop dancer than him even tho nobody even considers him in main dancer discussion)</p>

      <p>People forget there's so many genres in dance he excels in one style and has the foundation and background to be an overall great dancer but there's things others will be better than him in and it's just the truth
