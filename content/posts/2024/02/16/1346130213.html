      <p>why do zeroses suck up to akgaes, take their opinions seriously etc etc like idk how to explain it right but whenever i go to block an akgae and their likes on a stupid tweet (usually shading another member) so i don't have to see more on my tl there will be at least one account in there that presents as an 'ot9 zerose' in terms of all the other content they engage, talking about loving the members and shit like ðŸ˜­ a hypothetical but they'll like a tweet from an akgae calling for disbandment bc they feel like a member is taking from another member or something and then go on to rt a tweet about zb1's bond and how they're destined to be together like that i've never seen another fanbase that is so schizo. do they just not comprehend the useless, mind numbing bs they're engaging in or does not a single person here actually like the members and is an akgae/ot_ stan lmfao</p>

      <p>I think it's because some akgaes (not all) talk with a certain conviction and basically make their argument that they're akgaes by force and not by choice. There's been a lot of victim blaming and smear campaigns (idw use this word just cuz these are fanaccs it's not that seriousðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but I couldn't think of anything else) so when you have akgaes constantly telling regular fans how they should act it makes their word seem truer like they're not "disillusioned" like zeroses are. You could even say I'm an akgae (I dont think I am I engage in zb1 content daily and enjoy the group in my own little way) but I don't act like that or talk like that or try to push a narrative.

      <p>Yeah and zeroses let themselves be bullied by akgaes like people are scared to express the most mundane of opinions because they're scared of being jumped by schizos and stans in general are weak in terms of mental strength so they get convinced easily by speech even if the arguments don't make sense or are hypocritical</p>
