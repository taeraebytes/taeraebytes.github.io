      <p>Ngl Allins should just stop trying to make everyone leeching on hanbin because it's making it like clockwork for them already. Like on that m countdown live they were saying Hao isn't invited and he is actually just leeching off of hanbin asking himself to get invited and all and then he sat on the center when hanbin should be the center in mca live.

And then we had the radio show where it should've just been globalz until they decided to bring hanbin lmao. 

So they're ( rosin akgaes) dragging hb just like how allin dragged Hao for it</p>
