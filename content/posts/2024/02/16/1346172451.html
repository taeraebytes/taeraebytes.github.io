      <p>It's because those 3 actually threaten them (get Mt with the dance, Hao with idk why they do it since they're not even Hao's level in vocal:maybe because they also want center)</p>

      <p>It's obvious there was always going to be beef between rosins and allindans like inevitable beef but Matthew they dislike I forget why maybe the large fandom??? Idk and gunwook i wish they just ignored him honestly it's weird how they can't leave him alone but ig they stem from jealousy
