    "question": "op is probably young cause they're calling gunwook \"grown\" and as someone who is 23 i see everyone under 20 as kids and would never date them because you can tell they're still fresh out of high school, he literally turned 19 last month, he isn't a kid but 26 is a full grown adult and 19 is still a teenager, the type of thinking that just because someone turned legal of age means that grown adults can pursue them is a very dangerous one and only one type of people (groomers) see it as valid",
    "reply": "I think she's a young teen turning a legal age doesn't automatically make u a full grown mentally stable adult your brain isn't even fully developed. Like a teen is a teen I'm freshly 19 myself and I still don't consider myself to be that much of an adult because there's not much of a difference between 17/18 yr old me but me at 26 that's a brand new bitch. I can tell ops young too lol like it's sad but there's so so so many cases of ppl getting groomed at this age for that very same logic of being considered the same as a 30 yr old adult. And just considering the fact that a lot of his fans are 10+ yrs older than him and are very controlling it can get concerning but I think he's fine like there's distance still. He's not getting groomed at all😭😭😭 but also the outrage for everything he does is fake as shit because what has he done that every bloodclaat idol and celeb his age in history hasn't done already everyone gotta calm down and stop acting like he live streamed a murder"

      <p>26 is being so generous a lot of them 33+ and speak about how they're perverts and how they cannot wait to defile him... he's freshly 19 he may be legally an adult but grooming is still possible 19 IS SO YOUNG YOUR BRAIN ISNT EVEN FULLY DEVELOPED it's just less likely especially in a power imbalance like a celeb fan relationship😭😭😭 I don't think gunwooks being groomed but that's just very invalidating to actual victims to act like that doesn't happen and if ppl are concerned they can be concerned 🤷‍♀️ this girl is so dumb
