      <p>right i have no dog in this fight but shbaeri’s comebacks are so weak you can tell she has no argument candace def won that. but it’s also so annoying how allins will try to gag by using defamatory (and usually fake) rumors that have been spread about the other idols, they did that for gunwook they tried to gag him by using those fake ssng screenshots they just look stupid and also how is having malicious rumors being spread a gag 😭</p>
