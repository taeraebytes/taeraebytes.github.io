      <p>You can tell they're fed up for real cause they're complaining under official content
But honestly they've been begging for fun content since the fancon it's been one of the biggest complaint, it would fix sm issue if we got something like gose</p>

      <p>Someone said they are blaming jw for the bubble ban and itâ€™s making kfans more mad at him. Iâ€™m guessing they think thereâ€™s a ban since none of them have been live since the incident even the ones who regularly go live.</p>

      <p>Actually the last live was jw on feb 2nd but before that every other day someone was going live. If you go to bubblebaseone search live and from latest you can see how they suddenly stopped.</p>
