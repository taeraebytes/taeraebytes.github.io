      <p>it's kind of scary like it's people I've never heard of or seen constantly talking ab me.. idk how u say u hate someone but speak on them like this😭 plus they're all much much older than me and they say worse behind closed doors I've even had one threaten my friend before I don't have no beef and frankly i find them weird but they won't ever leave me alone

      <p>Yeah I hung out in the biggest allin ccs for a while as an ex toxic allin and they talk about you or send your ccs legitimately at least once a week, tbf she now says she doesn't care but will still post those asks an not some other that correct some of the misinformations she spreads..
Pretty much every allin cc I've ever been in actually has spoken about you at least once, most pretty regularly, I'm not sure how it is in other ccs but def a micro celebrity in the allin side</p>
