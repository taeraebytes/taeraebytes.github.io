      <p>i rly wish hanbin would do more waacking stuff like ugh that's what sets him apart from other male idol dancers anyways  i get that theres pressure to conform But cmon. Obviously hes not gonna look better dancing click like or 3D next to matthew cus they have completely different stylesðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦
but i guess there's not enough viral waacking trends or choreos for him to ever show it off so whatever</p>
