      <p>It's because those 3 actually threaten them (get Mt with the dance, Hao with idk why they do it since they're not even Hao's level in vocal:maybe because they also want center)</p>

      <p>It's obvious there was always going to be beef between rosins and allindans like inevitable beef but Matthew they dislike I forget why maybe the large fandom??? Idk and gunwook i wish they just ignored him honestly it's weird how they can't leave him alone but ig they stem from jealousy

      <p>you can dislike allins but Matthew wasn't right in that argument.

the part that he got was even more main vocal part than the main vocal part of the song and the one who suited that shit the best was seungeon who had the best vocals by far, i would maybe agree if it was a hanbin vs matthew for that main vocal part but it wasn't. seungeon sounded way better and he just needed to accept that idk what to tell you</p>
