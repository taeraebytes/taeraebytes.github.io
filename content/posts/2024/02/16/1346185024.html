      <p>yujin can go to hell for being in the center when he was not p01. you guys baby him too much, what if they are getting hated on? they deserve it for always undermining and ignoring haos center position. hao is being paid DUST by that stupid company, i cant believe there are people that are defending that company whenever it comes to hao and his center position or his solo jobs. hao as the groups center should he having a solo job every week or so, but wakeone is limiting him going as far as giving his jobs/positions to the other members. i really hope for you that gw is not anywhere near the center position or is getting more lines than hao just because he is "popular" in japan. hao is the most popular everywhere. anybody that says otherwise is a hater</p>
