      <p>The issue with zeroses is they don't let anyone complain lmao. If they complain they'll say that sf is overreacting 

Like I remember when gw doesn't have a sched in in bloom and has one of the fewest ending fairy and f2 stans were all over GW fans saying they shouldn't be complaining or just wait and all 

Rk fans complaining about rk sched and basically the mismanagemtn for rk and again same stans are basically mocking them and saying it's probably because no one called rk or rk doesn't want to do this or that

Zh fans with the center agenda

Taerae fans with how he is managed even when he is under Wakeone. 

Gyuvin/Matthew/Yujin too with their schedules 

Jw fans only complained after in bloom since they had the most schedules in in bloom era esp with his solo show

Hanbin fans complaining about him not being promoted since they said he didn't have any schedule in crush promo as well as not getting any main dancer promo</p>
