      <p>Lmaoo .... low autonomy is basically when someone  struggles to independently manage their thoughts and feelings, often relying heavily on external reassurance or avoiding certain situations in Rickyâ€™s case prolly triggers anxiety .</p>

      <p>Thank you sis ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but I googled it before but yea you can tell he's someone that's comes off very self conscious and seeing as how apparently he's been struggling w mental health since he was younger with bad anxiety I seriously have to applaud him. Being in the entertainment industry isn't easy for anyone and it must be harder for him he's seriously commendable and ik people say they want him to be more expressive but to me I'm seeing constant growth from him. But it's so nasty that people will use that in their ships and also infantilize and feminize him to make their yaoi work I said before but so many of his fans don't respect him as a person
