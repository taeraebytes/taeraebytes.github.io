      <p>idk why allins are tweaking sm when ppl dont acknowledge hb as a main vocal.. the only ones who think heâ€™s main vocal are them ðŸ˜­ the same fandom who would burst a blood vessel if someone says anyone other than hb is also the main dancer theyre so out of touch</p>

      <p>there is ONE professional dancer in the group btw and its sung hanbin, if i see any zeroses try to leech that too they're catching it. that's a title you get after dedicating a crazy amount of time and effort to dance as a career, there's no mini or little, there is ONE.
my mini main dancer, pro in the making, blah blah blah well nO that's an insult to actual professional dancers who have dedicated most of their life to dance, spent all their hours doing nothing but dance and treat it as their one and absolute career. so no. no leeching.</p>
