      <p>Zb1 as twitter stans:
Jiwoong doesn't have Stan Twitter but if he does probably something like Queen idk
Hao toxic gay gg Stan but he loves western divas too (Beyonce, gaga, Ari)
Hanbin nctzen Taylor swift army but he doesn't really get into fanwars 
Matthew biggest drake dick rider you've ever seen probably also loves Kanye moots w Gyuvin 
Taerae toxic Lana Stan also loves Nicki moots w hao
Ricky loves future carti frank ocean SZA Rihanna but he's not deep in Stan twt
Gyuvin weirdo carti Stan think Eminem is the goat
Gunwook foot x rap acc moots w Gyuvin is a hip hop old head and elitist, either hates drake or dick rides him heavy, is a mancity and PSG supporter 
Yujin: mostly a foot acc moots w gunwook, is real Madrid supporter</p>

      <p>Jiwoong on a Motorola 
hao ugh please he wouldn't be that bad.. he reminds me of tinashe and gaga fans with superiority complexes 
Hanbin would have all the numbers in symbols in his dn
Matthew yea
Taerae.. NAHðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he would be boring and probably on local twt and posts his game screenshots and stats and that's it 
Ricky yea hed probably post himself a lot with gay ass captions
Gyuvin would be on more troll twitter he does not seem like he rates Eminem 
Gunwook yea he'd be more local twt as well 
Yujin yes
