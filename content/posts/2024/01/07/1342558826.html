This is so funny and reminded me of that anon who said allins are so much nastier on priv because how are you as an alleged "ot9" interact with and follow akgaes out in the open but get mad someone is not praising your fav or calling him main vocal? 😭😭 These people are so obnoxious and then getting away with it while terrorizing everyone else is my villain origin story.</p>
