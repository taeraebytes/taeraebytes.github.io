      <p>I'm genuinely so sick of these begs terrorizing the whole fandom everytime hanbin gets hate like 😭😭 yeah that's terrible or whatever but everyone does and he doesn't even get the most shit. like one c-haobinist today literally threatened to bring a banner to gda to show it to zh and it could literally be classified as sexual harassment. imagine every sf doing this shit every time their fav got hate like SHUT THE FUCK UP OJ KY GOFFFFF they act like he's the most hated idol ever they won't survive a day stanning wonyoung.</p>

      <p>He definitely gets a lot of hate which is sad but to say he gets the most isn't entirely true and I've only ever seen their sf weaponize onto the fandom and accuse people like that fan was out of their mind bringing that sign and ngl it's sexual harassment towards hanbin as well it's just so annoying and old how they act

      <p>diff anon here i know what you mean but the problem here is the sign is written in chinese, they obviously targeting hao to read it. hanbin wouldn’t know what it means and can be blissfully oblivious unless he got it translated right there on stage. even on twitter the only ones who bothered to spread word about that sign so that gda attendees can help take it down are rosins and some ot9s, i hardly saw any allin accs talking about it because it doesn’t directly affect their bias. what im saying is a lot of times when c-haobinists do shit like this they always target hao (like sending him vile messages on bubble if he doesn’t interact with hanbin, bully him to not introduce himself as center; their questions to hao at fancalls and fansigns are often more invasive compared to the questions they ask hanbin because of the language barrier) and hao’s the one bearing the brunt of this weird harrassment towards both of them because he understands chinese, while rosins are always left to clean up the mess. 

even on a daily basis these c-haobinists turn everything hao does into a haobin thing, for example he could send a photo of a bowl of noodles on bubble and they will spam him with messages in like “are you eating with your husband?” (referring to hanbin), it’s literally mental illness. they treat them like they’re characters in a bl instead of actual humans</p>

      <p>Yea I agree they're much harsher to hao seeing as they speak the same language and they probably feel like they can criticize him more they push the responsibility on him like it doesn't take two people to make a duo it's sad that he goes thru this

      <p>the thing is how likely is hao to see this like is it something he can easily ignore???? could be a loud minority or something he might not come across as i’m sure he gets mostly nice messages or whatever else he gets sent downs it out bc that sounds like straight up illness. if i was him i’d tune it tf out and keep doing what i wanna do which i can actually see him doing</p>

      <p>I cant give u a gauge but they're definitely a force so it's not like a small minority they are a minority compared to the actual fans but imagine if it's such an issue to fans it's ten fold of that that he's experiencing

      <p>But let not forget c-rosins also lie a lot they often do edit they bring on twitter just for peole to call out c-Zerocolas. Some of them are mental I admit but in the comments section of Haobin sp you can see a lot of call out comments to not cross boundaries. And it’s always the same 2/3 screenshots from YITS era c-rosins bring on twitter.</p>
