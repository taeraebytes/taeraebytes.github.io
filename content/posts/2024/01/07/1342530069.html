      <p>I know y'all are it's just some Ricky high school anecdotes I'm not gonna post if op doesn't want me to but it's just more in depth things of what we discuss I'll break it down ricky had a driver apparently had bad anxiety and wore masks (we knew that and could tell) skipped a lot his friends were bad influences apparently his mom didn't like them that kinda thing and he himself cut them off not the other way around
