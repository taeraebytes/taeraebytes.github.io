      <p>I know y'all are it's just some Ricky high school anecdotes I'm not gonna post if op doesn't want me to but it's just more in depth things of what we discuss I'll break it down ricky had a driver apparently had bad anxiety and wore masks (we knew that and could tell) skipped a lot his friends were bad influences apparently his mom didn't like them that kinda thing and he himself cut them off not the other way around

      <p>Have u not heard about his highschool stalker? The one on tiktok who wanted clout and posted pictures of him back in highschool onto her tt? She would purposely pose with him in the background and he's unaware that his picture is being taken and whenever she walked by him she would secretly film him. That bitch is crazy especially since he was just a normal kid in Highschool not even a trainee. I'd wear a mask 24/7 too.</p>

      <p>Yes my friend knew her she was hyper fixated on him and followed him to take pics but that was it and it wasn't long before she moved onto her new shiny piece he wore the mask regardless
