      <p>taerae is gayyyy i didnt even think that until a few months ago but there is literally no reason to make thirst traps that pander to gay men unless that's a majority of your fanbase (not true for him), you're trying to make fujos think you're gay (gyuvin would do this bc he's insane but other straight zb1 members would not), or you're gay yourself</p>

      <p>recently he mentioned his sister again he said as a child his sister told him to get her ice-cream from the supermarket so he went but he bought the wrong one so she forced him to go back to buy the right one he said he couldn't speak up against it because his sister always cooked him food and took care of him when his parents weren't there so cute ðŸ˜­ his sister also bragged about tr to her colleagues and told them to vote for him but never stated that he's her brother just someone he knows ðŸ˜­ I think he really looks up a lot to his sister he was also living with her when he started being a trainee</p>

      <p>thatâ€™s why i said tr is jus a cutie guy, thatâ€™s a behavior when you really close with your sister and spoil by mom. (iâ€™m not homophobic)!! (compared with gv, raised by a happy family but an oldest brother who doesnâ€™t close with his siblings)</p>
