      <p>Yup the members gets nothing, just stats and bragging rights. Let's use hao for example, his fans will buy ZB1's album through his cbar so then ppl/ w1 will know how many people bought an album because of Hao. W1 then may favor Hao because he has the highest amount of sales and give him more gigs and vice versa for members with lower sales w1 prob wont focus on them as much.

But there's this stigma going on especially with rice fans lately discrediting our roty, saying we wouldn't win if it weren't for cbars but cbar sales are still sales, from real people using their own money the only difference is is that they're Chinese. The sinophobic undertones are fcking weird and they don't even realize it.</p>

      <p>The discrediting cbar sales is annoying like it's still an album bought and money back to the company so why do we care and people genuinely do recieve these albums a lot may go to waste but it's not mindless bulk buying which is illegal in China anyways. Most goms use them as proxies cuz multiple people are part of one bar.
