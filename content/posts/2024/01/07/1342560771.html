    "reply": "not to be a deobi again but they did that for their third fancon in 2020 its such a fun and interactive concept I hope they do smth like that cuz at their fancon everyone performed in units or solos plus group performances it was so fun. Like this concept would eat esp the fan dresscode the tbz one was in late 2020 so it was virtual but still super fun"
