      <p>japan debut and fancon is march so id say korean cb is april maybe may the latest. the japan debut is only 1 new song and the jp version of their titles im pretty sure so its just 1 new choreo to learn. i donâ€™t think they need 2 months to prepare for that so they might simultaneously be preparing for their korean cb. kcon la is july and the tour is july/august but idk if they have a lot of other schedules the cb might be may/june but yeah kfans arenâ€™t gonna tune in for a japan release so they need a cb asap. at least w the end of year and award shows they were able to keep the attention</p>

      <p>This might be the schedule they follow ik they'll be getting basically no rest but I wonder how they're gonna fit kcon la between the tour like ok it's gonna happen but they're doing what tbz did flying in hours before ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>They probably wonâ€™t attend all the kcons they only attend 2 last year Japan and LA so I think they will probably do the same this year</p>
