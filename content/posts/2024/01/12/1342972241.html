      <p>going to analyze chart patterns so skip the 2nd para if u don‚Äôt care abt that: 

what riize managed to achieve in digitals is lowkey almost impossible to replicate on another bg. zb1 had a lot of hype for in bloom bc of bp but the song only managed to peak at 70 on melon daily a week after release and then it slowly started to fall. this is the pattern that every bg follows (except for bts and seventeen as of late) bc the fandoms make up most of the streams but ppl don‚Äôt have the time and energy to stream for weeks on end. zb1 did have a pretty big initial kfandom but wakeone made a lot of mistakes in their first few months and a lot of ppl ended up moving on. come melting point, the bp hype train was long gone and the fandom was smaller bc it was mostly the dedicated ones who stayed. but there‚Äôs still a downwards trend in the # of ppl listening to in bloom from when it released. 

if you look at riize‚Äôs trends: gag started like any bg song: it peaked around debut and then fell to the point where it was out of the top 100. about 1-2 weeks later the dance started to go viral on tiktok and the song boomed up the charts peaking mid october and staying in the 16-22 zone throughout november/early december. talk saxy again followed the bg pattern: peaked around release and slowly started to fall and it did this for a month until literally the day after mama (11/26) where it started to rapidly gain new listeners every day. in the span of 10 days it went up 10k daily uls and 60 spots on the daily chart and to this day it‚Äôs continued to slowly increase (around the holidays it did start to fall again but after christmas it started to rise again and is currently at a new peak). gag looked like it was maybe going to decline mid december but after christmas it has also experienced a rapid rise up the charts, gaining over 25k daily uls in the last 2.5 weeks and is projected to possibly repeak at 16 in the next few days. all of their songs are experiencing an upward trend in listeners/chart rankings regardless of whether they are a new/old release and are lowkey doing better than ever.  
this sort of longevity for a bg is almost unheard of bc usually when a song starts falling it‚Äôs game over. even if zb1 manages to hit daebaek it doesn‚Äôt ensure long term success look at how istj did despite being released right after candy, which is dreams biggest success by far.

the success and direction riize is going cant be replicated bc it can‚Äôt be predicted. trends are a mass movement u can‚Äôt force it onto the public. u can try but at the end of the day, what sticks and what doesn‚Äôt is dictated by the gp and is almost purely up to chance and a million different events that had to line up in a very particular way in order for things to occur the way they did.</p>

      <p>damn... let's start banging some juujüôè I'm just a hopeful likkle fan but the decline of zb1s fandom is real but not to the scale where it's small it's still very large a lot of kfans were genuinely upset and only streamed the nights before music shows for wins (which even in the full house they had 2 chances to actually win wakeone just didn't ship albums which is our strongest suit they're so fucking dumbüò≠) their turn outs for irl events are huge and they were rivaling large fandoms in numbers. Idt they're gonna replicate anything w riize but they have a chance as well seeing as how they can just grow their fandom if they do things right but who knows

      <p>not really related to this but some kzeroses didnt even stream crush because they didnt want to give a shit song (in their opinion) a win and delude wakeone into thinking thats the direction fans want them to keep going in. We were always runner up against bigger groups even with a song like crush, wakeone not shipping the albums + fandom purposely not streaming so I call that a  win</p>
