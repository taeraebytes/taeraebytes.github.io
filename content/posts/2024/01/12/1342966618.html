      <p>hao needs to chill, too pointy + put filler where the implant outline is 
ricky havent got any more chin filler since in bloom imo cause its slowly going back to his normal chin and looks good rn
gyuvin stopped yup
hanbin looks good rn yup
gunwook looks good yup but idt he got any fillers to begin with
jiwoong needs to chill with the botox rather than filler, his left eye gonna pop out soon + can u even reverse veneers? don't they shave ur tooth down into those pointy shark tooth kinda thing
matty dont think he got anything done since in bloom but i dont like that orange blonde on him, needs darker hair
taerae looks the same as in bloom</p>

      <p>Yea hao needs a blend 
Ricky is putting the shit down we cheered 
jiwoongs eyes scare me sometimes but his veneers are bad work i wouldn't be surprised if he had shark teeth under there he could get them replaced but he doesn't look like he will 
Matthew I don't think so either but the hair is actually horrendous now 
taeraes looking better since he doesn't have weird ugly green hair
