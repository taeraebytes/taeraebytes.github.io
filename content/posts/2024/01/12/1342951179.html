      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service eitherðŸ˜† by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>

      <p>Although they did post insta dumps for both Matthew as mc and hao with his award and included them in the zero focus with the group too hanbin only had the same 2 pics posted on twt and insta and the end of year award show compilation came out today and they posted behinds from all the award shows and festivals but conveniently skipped out aaa entirely</p>
