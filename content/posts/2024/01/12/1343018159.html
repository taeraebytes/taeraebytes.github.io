      <p>I am sorry but I don't get why people even get those chin implants, if you want an snatched face just get a face lypo, those chin implants just end up giving idols a double chin, those idols will do diets and all of that to look skinny yet they get those implants with double chin effect like???</p>

      <p>The implants to give him more of a chin ig otherwise there's no point but yea I think other measures could've been taken but his company wasn't trying to get him the best of the best

      <p>have u guys seen those asian face massages where the literally smash your face in and it actually works? It fixes your asymmetric face and makes it smaller cause your skull is like tectonic plates so they can move.

And even if not an idol you guys should invest in a gua sha or those chinese soup spoon if u broke, it really does slim your face down and feels good cause you can feel the bloating in your face drain</p>
