      <p>😭😭😭 i think it has to be their dance instructor or whoever teaching them these facial expressions cuz gunwooks had been doing it a lot too and it was real bad during i think the christmas show but i just kept my mouth shut. Haven't seen him do it since tho 🙏👍</p>

      <p>Hsjshsh okay but Yujin would be sooo much more bigger if he had some passion behind his performance he just lacks a bit of soul or excitement, even in songs like Nkotb or Say my name , very Hyewon from Izone deer caught in lights eyes - i know he’s young but hes just very boring to watch and i hope he imporves</p>
