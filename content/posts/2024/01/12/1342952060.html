 same anon who talked about them not getting approval either â€¦ but this is why rosins need to slow down because they were accusing all these cbars of getting approval from wakeone and theirs being ignored  and yet none of them have actually come out and said they have.</p>

      <p>Different anon but I saw haos c bar actually made a post that they did get a response from the company yesterday and afaik they are the only bar to get a response, but itâ€™s even more funnt because they were trending tags today about wakeone responding to his bars email even though they already had the response by that point ðŸ˜­</p>
