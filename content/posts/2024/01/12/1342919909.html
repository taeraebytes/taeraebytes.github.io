      <p>A little bit TMI but a year ago I went to Korea for the first time I always regret not going to a lot of kpop related things but I did apply for artist battle boys planet and got in, at the time I didn't really have a fave but I came out as a Ricky fan from over me ðŸ˜­ But honestly that was one of the worst days of my life, I had no idea we had to wait for 6 hours with no food and drink the hottest venue possible, no phones but the whole process was so interesting. Btw everything is really structured I've never been to a live audience so I didn't know, but they tell you when to scream when the mc comes in and the waits between the groups were sooo long! Anyways I can give you some review if you want but I don't want to type too long but I love ur cc haha</p>

      <p>Not the anon but I can share my experience. I was in Korea alone, well I was there with my friends but we all wanted to do something different with our limited time there so some of us just did out own thing for the entire day, like me. This might sound depressing but it's seems normal to be alone there ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ I went to bday cafes, normal cafes, pop ups, photo booths, stores, restaurants and wandered the streets etc and there were always people by themselves. No one really cares if you have company or not tbh everyone just did their own thing and I didn't get any side eyes or have people staring at me because I was alone, like they pity me or something. And I had fun, I did and ate everything I wanted. 

Though I mostly did 'day' stuff and I was in the city always around other people, if you were to do clubbing, bars or anything alcohol involved I would rec a friend just for safety.</p>
