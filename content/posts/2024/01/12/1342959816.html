      <p>its funny how hao and hanbin akgaes dont think that hao or hanbin benefited from the haobin ship. im not saying thats the only thing they see popular for but it did help them ALOT, and still is helping them alot since casual kpop fans love stuff like that.</p>

      <p>Now that’s is just a LIE Ricky has always been noticed by casuals on TikTok and know for his individuality. He literally didn’t even have a duo to rely on for popularity during BP</p>
