      <p>There wasn't voting it was a personality test that they supposedly took and WK1 picked Hanbin based on the criteria (which they set). Not mad that it ended up being him, but there wasn't any sort of group vote.

      <p>wasn't that personality test video scripted and filmed after they picked the leader??? bc imo it always felt scripted as hell but at the same time w1 is obsessed with personality test to the point they allegedly picked the dorm roomies through a personality test</p>

      <p>If you mean they as in WK1, probably. If it was group selected, they wouldn't have scripted something and done what enhypen did (if i remember correctly). At least if it's through a personality test it looks more objective, even if we aren't even sure if they did do a personality test or if those actually were the results, and WK1 was the one who choose the criteria for a good leader

Honestly enhypen's leader selection could have also been scripted as well because I don't remember seeing individual responses, so maybe they should have done that instead. Don't know if any enhypen members said anything outside that leader selection video since I only was interested in them for like a week</p>
