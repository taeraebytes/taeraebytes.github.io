      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service eitherðŸ˜† by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>

      <p>i kinda have a crazy theory in my head where their sns manager in an underpaid intern that is very pissed at the agency and they want everybody to feel miserable and angry too, so they create a mess with how zb1â€™s media accs are being handled on purpose</p>
