      <p>It depends on the implant, I've seen chin implants that don't look bad at all and terrible jaw shaves. A bad jaw shave example would be Karina around 2021 like she looked uncanny, also NCT yuta did a jaw shave and it was badddd. Usually jaw shaves look even worse</p>

      <p>i think the only thing that looks bad in his face is his nose but only from the side cause its too pointy, he didnt need that implant at all his natural nose was so cute</p>
