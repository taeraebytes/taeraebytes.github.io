      <p>its funny how hao and hanbin akgaes dont think that hao or hanbin benefited from the haobin ship. im not saying thats the only thing they see popular for but it did help them ALOT, and still is helping them alot since casual kpop fans love stuff like that.</p>

for allins there is no hope, they are in denial and also think that zh is the only one who feeds the ship, when hanbin is the same as zh. also do we even know if that "bubble is a personal space" reply that he gave to zerocolas is even real? bc i have not seen proof and yet they keep mentioning it.</p>
