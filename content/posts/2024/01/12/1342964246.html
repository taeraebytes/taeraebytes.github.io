      <p>wait did they reveal the candidates bc i donâ€™t remember that?? i remember hanbin said gunwook helps with leading dance practice alongside him so he def has leadership qualities, as well as all his debate and school stuff, but yeah picking gunwook wouldnâ€™t have been the best due to age and all that.

predebut i thought jiwoong might be leader and didnâ€™t think itâ€™d be a bad idea due to already having experience in the kpop industry but now iâ€™m thankful it wasnâ€™t him LMAO hanbin is the perfect pick for sureeeee</p>

      <p>They had a little video where there were categories for leader criteria's it's on YouTube every member was technically a candidate. And I knew jiwoong wasn't gonna be shit from the very beginning ðŸ˜­
