      <p>The thing is Rickys one is more natural, like he just looks like he was naturally born like that and in a way it complements the look he seems to be going for which is the manhwa character with pointed v chin . But hao it just looks off and sudden i need him to never get his face touched again</p>

      <p>No sis Ricky's used to scare me he had a long face to begin with and it genuinely elongated his face is such a way ugh I'm glad it's a lot better he's looking good alr. And it was not just me all my riyangi friends hated it he naturally doesn't have a very sharp strong chin of you look at pics of him in may his chin was pretty soft

      <p>Diff anon, but I remember it was like right around august it was so bad because he started wearing contacts and lost so much weight like face shrinked down to the cheeks. His chin is less severe now but his face is still too skinny imo I need him to go back to drinking strawberry smoothies daily or sum</p>
