      <p>Ricky isn’t an implant it’s filler, Hao on the other hand yes but I think if he gains weight his implant will look even better</p>

      <p>I am sorry but I don't get why people even get those chin implants, if you want an snatched face just get a face lypo, those chin implants just end up giving idols a double chin, those idols will do diets and all of that to look skinny yet they get those implants with double chin effect like???</p>

      <p>Not even face lipo all they need to do is just invest in gua sha (to get a more natural look) and do a neck lift and their set like it’s not hard</p>

      <p>The implants to give him more of a chin ig otherwise there's no point but yea I think other measures could've been taken but his company wasn't trying to get him the best of the best
