      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service eitherüòÜ by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>
