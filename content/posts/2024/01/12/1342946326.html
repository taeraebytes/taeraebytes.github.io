      <p>Ok I still dislike seungwoo a lot because he acted dirty and ungrateful the whole time he was in x1 (like victon was a better grp or something), had the nerve to bait with dongpyo for clout , and then when shit got serious (the scandal) he left his younger members alone at the dorm and was outside drinking and getting lit with victon but he atleast seemed closer to x1 members than Jiwoong is with zb1 ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I wasn't a oneit or nothing but someone mentioned that here before like wow it's crazy he was actually a decent hyung compared to jw but I gotta give some credit at least he respects the team and being an idol like seungwoo just sounds crazy
