      <p>has yujin done anything? i'd hope not due to his age, plus he looks pretty similar from the few predebut things i've seen. sometimes i look at his teeth and am like "are those veneers" bc they look kinda perfect but that may just be bc i'm traumatised by one of my ult groups getting a veneer groupon from their local orthodontist or whatever (bet it's totally hard to guess which group this is LMAOOOOOOOOO).. his nose also kinda makes me pause and maybe he got the typical eyelid work but i'm only saying these ones bc they're the usual kpop procedures. i hope he got nothing done even tho that's delusional üôè</p>

      <p>I think he got smth done nothing crazy maybe eyelids and nose filler he used to have a hump on his nose and it looks straighter now he's young but also handsome so not too much
