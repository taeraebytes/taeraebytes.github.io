      <p>if they didn't, riize would definitely be called flops compared to zb1 and a big gap in the awards shows calculations would also make zb1 look much more ahead than riize and there would be less room for growth because people only like to stan "the next big thing" instead now, people are trying to say zb1 fell off because crush didn't chart as well as in bloom (but still much better than talk saxy)</p>
