      <p>nah he's based af for this actually. mbti is a scam and just an advanced version of horoscope. koreans are very judgmental over it to the point they ask for it in job resumes. if i was an idol i wouldn't give it either because, let's be real, fans just want to know it so they can go to the site and read about romantic and sexual preference of their bias. but i'm sorry that ricky not giving a fuck about a psychointellectual buzzfeed test angers you, anon :(</p>
