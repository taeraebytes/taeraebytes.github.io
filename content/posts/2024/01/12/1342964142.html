      <p>You're right it would be real bad but I think may also might be a possible time as well just cuz idk a month in between jpn debut and cb makes sense to me

      <p>japan debut and fancon is march so id say korean cb is april maybe may the latest. the japan debut is only 1 new song and the jp version of their titles im pretty sure so its just 1 new choreo to learn. i donâ€™t think they need 2 months to prepare for that so they might simultaneously be preparing for their korean cb. kcon la is july and the tour is july/august but idk if they have a lot of other schedules the cb might be may/june but yeah kfans arenâ€™t gonna tune in for a japan release so they need a cb asap. at least w the end of year and award shows they were able to keep the attention</p>
