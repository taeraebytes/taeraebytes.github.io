      <p>from an outsiders pov, i think that sung hanbin mentioned the things he did on his bubble to try and calm down the fans. they should stop spamming wakeone with the "take legal action" thing. there are no more trucks in front of wakeone and there probably wont be any forwhile. they probably want to move past what happened. his label is already collecting stuff to sue people. the fans should try to enjoy/love the group or their bias more.</p>

      <p>I think so too it's damaging to continue bringing up this issue for him and the fans this is the best it's gonna get and it's better to move on it's just something u have to deal with being an idol
