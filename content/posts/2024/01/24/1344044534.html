      <p>I really think this where everything went wrong in the fandom i mean there were some fights before but not as big as this, the atmosphere in the fandom was the worsttttt i had to log off my account, a lot of his fans left and became solos instead i feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back and the way the company handled it is just bad and they made it worse by saying theyâ€™re gonna make him sign all the albums after he recovers and posted a group photos without him, iâ€™ve like a million thoughts on how this situation couldâ€™ve been handled better.</p>
