      <p>See you're part of the problem tbh rosins and allins are way more organzied for ot9 initiatives too but the small solo fandoms and ot9 zeroses don't do shit, expect everyone else to carry them, and then blame it on solos 🙄 gpds stop being lazy as hell!!!</p>

      <p>ok i’m the anon that sent the ask before this and i just wanna say that i am not this person and i was totally messing with you i only be voting and streaming on spotify and yt too and i don’t dedicate hours of my life to it too this kpop shit is for fun 😪 people act like being a stan is a job and not to say that we shouldn’t be helping our faves achieve things and i am super happy when they reach milestones but the obsession with stats is literally just crazy and inorganic 😭 id rather see zb1 get a bunch of streams cuz they’re actually popular and they have a wide reach than just because of mass streaming yknow. people only like these achievements to vicariously live through their faves because they have none of their own but lemme not wake up that tea 🌝</p>

      <p>that's not licking ass anon ❤️ licking ass and being a beg is when you literally like and rts multiple twts from a fandom what's known for hating on the group your bias is in just bc they bait-praised your fav once. and we all know who that is hope this helps! showing appreciation for someone acknowledging your fav esp if they're rookie is totally normal please be serious.</p>
