      <p>I really think this where everything went wrong in the fandom i mean there were some fights before but not as big as this, the atmosphere in the fandom was the worsttttt i had to log off my account, a lot of his fans left and became solos instead i feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back and the way the company handled it is just bad and they made it worse by saying they’re gonna make him sign all the albums after he recovers and posted a group photos without him, i’ve like a million thoughts on how this situation could’ve been handled better.</p>

      <p>THIS!!! most of these borderline solo stan rosins were ot9s until that covid fansign fiasco. i can't even blame them like he really got treated like shit despite being the center. they not only didn't let him perform Always in their fancon but also skipped Always more than once while they played songs from yits during the waiting time before online streaming it was crazy😭 i think those who were still holding on to the hope of him getting better treatment finally lost it at the most ridiculous damage control of all time that was haohao good times. i cried tears of happiness when i saw the teaser only for it to be almost the same duration as his solo song. it was obvious that they made him film half of that show in one sitting on the same day he got out of quarantine. look me in the eyes and tell me you wouldn't become a solo stan after seeing your bias getting treated like this after you voted like theres no tomorrow to make him the center of the group. fansign + fancon + haohao good times caused the rosin akgae epidemic</p>

      <p>That's because shb's fans were really 'loud' back then, u can’t deny it bcs they really controlled everything. When ZH said 'ZH will be #1 whatever he does’ they made a hate article on Pann, trending at #8 for 2 days. During the fancon, they said ZH shouldn't perform his solo song to avoid hurting other members and even threatened WK1 not to make any solo performances. and there was an article about members' fancon merch sales where ZH's was 6x more than other members, and they terrorize OP to delete it bcs they’re concerned other members might see😭</p>

      <p>Not the same anon or an allin but isn’t hanbin in September basically zh now ? Both these members have a lot of solo schedules and promotions and yet both their fandoms still find a way to be miserable. Try being a riyangi for a day 😭 all we have to look forward to is mc coming up</p>

      <p>This made me check and I don't think it's that bad? he's getting the magazine and ost promo which is understandable after the embarrassment that was the magazine thing and the anti Hanbin trucks but other members are sending pics and do lives and matt has his vlog thing, I think it's fine for now but they should reduce solo schedule and focus strongly on group and subunit schedules instead</p>

      <p>"reduce solo schedules" I think the fuck not if your bias is not in demand anon that's a different story why do the popular members have to be sacrificed for the sake of the group?</p>

      <p>you guys are so dumb the solo schedules are what's causing a ruckus and if you think most of the members aren't popular how would they have debuted like ur just not being smart at all😭 and reducing solo schedules would promote the group better and have them be more popular later on post disbandment which is the entire point of them existing do you think all 9 of them made it so that only a few people could be promoted recently like plz be serious more members are popular in a plethora of countries and those that aren't would greatly benefit from promo this is when I get irked by you hoes HOW ARE U THIS DUMB

moreover there’s no way for them to communicate with new fans because the only place they regularly connect with fans is on bbl and mnet+ but what kind of new fan who’s just checking them out is going to sub to bbl or download fucking mnet+ lmao.</p>
