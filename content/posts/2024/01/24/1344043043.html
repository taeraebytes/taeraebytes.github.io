      <p>i can't see many groups disbanding, the older groups feel like they've established that they're staying but are just less active. the groups up for contracts are the 2017 batch so i can see golden child and weki meki going but like idk, they're the only ones i can think of that debuted in 2017 other than tbz and dreamcatcher but tbz probably wouldn't disband and dreamcatcher did renewals early i'm pretty sure</p>
