      <p>akgaes always think their fav is exempt when they insult the group they're a part of, make things worse for the group by supporting others in spite, liking hate tweets about the entire group etc etc and it's just so stupid like if they're not a debuted solo artist (and if any of them do end up debuting solo post-zb1 watch as they completely forget about their existence as that happens with nearly every single survival show group so praying for their disbandment amounted to nothing) then they have practically nothing outside the group and don't benefit from what's happening at all üò≠ there's absolutely NOTHING going on up in there</p>

      <p>At the end of the day 70% of those who are screaming x go solo will not support him when he does, they came from another fandom and after x peaks popularity (zb1) they'll have no reason to support,,, i'm in a ex-w1 soloist fandom and we talk about this all the time, fans dont want to support someone who isnt guranteed to be popular no matter how much they hate zb1 , theyre also hypocrites i can gurantee most of them tuned into boys planet bc of the shows concept then found their bias not the other way around</p>

      <p>Yup that's so true I was really into x1 (and izone but obvs it ended a lot better for them) and the reason x1 had to pull away was basically because of the crazy stans of some undebuted trainees who (very easily, bcs it really wasn't subtle) exposed the rigging and now literally none of them support those guysüò≠ I laugh every time I see akgaes saying zeroes won't be here for MY baby grown ass man in 3 years like most of y'all won't be either I've been there done that even the successful produce acts usually have a brand new fan base post disbandment</p>
