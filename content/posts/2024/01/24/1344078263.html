      <p>bruh i just saw a tweet notification i got from zb1's twitter and it says "zerobaseone is on the cover of [spotify playlist]" but the pic is just of zhang hao (and like yeah his name and ost title is in the hashtags of the tweet but still) maybe i'm overthinking it bc i'm traumatised from the past week's events but why do i feel like we're gonna have another bout of war from akgaes LORD SEND THE FUCKING FLOOD</p>

      <p>I really think this where everything went wrong in the fandom i mean there were some fights before but not as big as this, the atmosphere in the fandom was the worsttttt i had to log off my account, a lot of his fans left and became solos instead i feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back and the way the company handled it is just bad and they made it worse by saying they‚Äôre gonna make him sign all the albums after he recovers and posted a group photos without him, i‚Äôve like a million thoughts on how this situation could‚Äôve been handled better.</p>

      <p>THIS!!! most of these borderline solo stan rosins were ot9s until that covid fansign fiasco. i can't even blame them like he really got treated like shit despite being the center. they not only didn't let him perform Always in their fancon but also skipped Always more than once while they played songs from yits during the waiting time before online streaming it was crazyüò≠ i think those who were still holding on to the hope of him getting better treatment finally lost it at the most ridiculous damage control of all time that was haohao good times. i cried tears of happiness when i saw the teaser only for it to be almost the same duration as his solo song. it was obvious that they made him film half of that show in one sitting on the same day he got out of quarantine. look me in the eyes and tell me you wouldn't become a solo stan after seeing your bias getting treated like this after you voted like theres no tomorrow to make him the center of the group. fansign + fancon + haohao good times caused the rosin akgae epidemic</p>

      <p>goddamn you asked the question anon and i just said for me personally üò≠ i‚Äôm just not a hateful person my biases have gotten sm hate FROM THE FANDOM (especially the fandom that YOURE a part of) and i still don‚Äôt hold it against the members themselves like why would i hate innocent people? and also personally (emphasis on the word personally) i‚Äôve always been more of a group stan than a bias stan so unless the members do something egregious i‚Äôm probably going to like all of them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
