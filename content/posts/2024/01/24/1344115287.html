      <p>I really think this where everything went wrong in the fandom i mean there were some fights before but not as big as this, the atmosphere in the fandom was the worsttttt i had to log off my account, a lot of his fans left and became solos instead i feel like this is the straw that broke the camel's back and the way the company handled it is just bad and they made it worse by saying theyâ€™re gonna make him sign all the albums after he recovers and posted a group photos without him, iâ€™ve like a million thoughts on how this situation couldâ€™ve been handled better.</p>

      <p>THIS!!! most of these borderline solo stan rosins were ot9s until that covid fansign fiasco. i can't even blame them like he really got treated like shit despite being the center. they not only didn't let him perform Always in their fancon but also skipped Always more than once while they played songs from yits during the waiting time before online streaming it was crazyðŸ˜­ i think those who were still holding on to the hope of him getting better treatment finally lost it at the most ridiculous damage control of all time that was haohao good times. i cried tears of happiness when i saw the teaser only for it to be almost the same duration as his solo song. it was obvious that they made him film half of that show in one sitting on the same day he got out of quarantine. look me in the eyes and tell me you wouldn't become a solo stan after seeing your bias getting treated like this after you voted like theres no tomorrow to make him the center of the group. fansign + fancon + haohao good times caused the rosin akgae epidemic</p>

      <p>That's because shb's fans were really 'loud' back then, u canâ€™t deny it bcs they really controlled everything. When ZH said 'ZH will be #1 whatever he doesâ€™ they made a hate article on Pann, trending at #8 for 2 days. During the fancon, they said ZH shouldn't perform his solo song to avoid hurting other members and even threatened WK1 not to make any solo performances. and there was an article about members' fancon merch sales where ZH's was 6x more than other members, and they terrorize OP to delete it bcs theyâ€™re concerned other members might seeðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Not the same anon or an allin but isnâ€™t hanbin in September basically zh now ? Both these members have a lot of solo schedules and promotions and yet both their fandoms still find a way to be miserable. Try being a riyangi for a day ðŸ˜­ all we have to look forward to is mc coming up</p>

      <p>This made me check and I don't think it's that bad? he's getting the magazine and ost promo which is understandable after the embarrassment that was the magazine thing and the anti Hanbin trucks but other members are sending pics and do lives and matt has his vlog thing, I think it's fine for now but they should reduce solo schedule and focus strongly on group and subunit schedules instead</p>

      <p>itâ€™s too late now, they canâ€™t promote as a group anymore (like for variety show or smtg like that). after japan debut many solo gigs will come to a certain members again</p>

      <p>It doesnâ€™t even have to be all 9 because obviously outside of their own produced content it will probably be hard to get all 9 somewhere, but more unit stuff would be nice and more of their own produced variety content would probably be better too</p>

      <p>Unit stuff is more realistic it's difficult to send 9 people when idol group shows barely exist these days
