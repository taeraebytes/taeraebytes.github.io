      <p>i find it really weird how wk1 is not responding to any demands... like the hb hashtags have been trending for days the least they could do to shut these people up is put out a statement like idgi. it's like they insist on keeping chaos in the fandom</p>

      <p>they're not gonna acknowledge people asking for legal action and the protection thing is an internal effort and a legal team which they don't have and responding to the issue would further escalate things because it's finally starting to calm down

      <p>I mean all he said was that he gained strength because of fans messages, I don’t really think there’s an underlying meaning to it. If I’m completely honest I’m not going to speak to much on how allins deal with that specific situation because ik if they pulled that shit on gw I’d be on the news for throwing bricks at that w1 building if they didn’t do shit</p>

      <p>Someone just sent it to me I think it's just allindan schizophrenics it sounded like a sweet message of encouragement and reassurance that they make him feel better nothing more nothing less but yea same i would've lost my mind and that where I come to a point of understanding but this isn't really him talking ab the situation 😭😭

      <p>Oh really ? Ik you guys don’t give a shit about hanbin but since the truck situation you can literally tell he knows what’s up and the recent messages he sent on were basically “You gave me a lot of strength because you said a lot of good things. That’s why I can get back on my feet” like literally it’s not just some “oh he’s being sweet to his fans” moment he was hinting cause what does “get back on my feet” would mean. 
Like you guys would go schizo yourself if you were in a situation where you had freaking 4 trucks being sent for your bias in a week and on top of that wakeone’s incompetent ass ignoring everything. Have we not seen how other sfs are currently trending tags for literally everything rn and allins trending tags for wakeone to take legal actions is suddenly “dramatic” if this was happening to someone else you’d all be sympathetic towards them. Like I get it you guys don’t like allins but being sad over such a situation is completely normal and I’m sure every other sf would’ve reacted pretty much the same way and rosins would’ve been worse.</p>

      <p>you guys just want that to be true so bad it's not and it's still very up in the air who sent the trucks and there's allegations of his own fans sending them so.. I said it's sweet because it's a message of encouragement it's obvious that he's aware but he's not literally discussing about it and bringing it up as people say ofc anyone would be sad I'm just saying continuing to prolong this and send anything else BUT messages of encouragement to him isn't good fans are free to do what they want I'm not the police and I've already said that's where I come to an understanding with his fans because I would act the same it's just a matter of accepting that this is something the company will definitely sweep under the rug and it's better to let it pass rather than constantly reminding urself because it's not going to get better

      <p>it’s not 2? i remember it’s only two. the first truck from instiz zeroses and the 2nd from callins. 
allins the first truck literally said fans want fair treatment, no one mentioned your fave but then SHB global sent a revenge truck with “don’t reduce shb opportunities” or smtg which made kfans dgaf about yall</p>

      <p>I'm not sure how much was in total but there were trucks sent back towards the 1st truck so it's not like everything was a hate truck like it's better to forget all this it's a mess
