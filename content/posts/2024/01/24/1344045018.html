      <p>akgaes always think their fav is exempt when they insult the group they're a part of, make things worse for the group by supporting others in spite, liking hate tweets about the entire group etc etc and it's just so stupid like if they're not a debuted solo artist (and if any of them do end up debuting solo post-zb1 watch as they completely forget about their existence as that happens with nearly every single survival show group so praying for their disbandment amounted to nothing) then they have practically nothing outside the group and don't benefit from what's happening at all 😭 there's absolutely NOTHING going on up in there</p>

      <p>right they keep saying “zb1 disband” “x leave the group” but i truly dare them to say this to their bias’s face or else it’s all just empty words like do they seriously think their bias would jump for joy seeing his own fans trending disbandment hashtags 😭</p>
