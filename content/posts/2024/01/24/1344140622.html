      <p>😭😭😭😭😭 I actually don’t know how it accumulated so fast but like all the magazines, I bought that bring green perfume, things from their collabs like romantic crown and the spao pjs. The merch and stuff like from the fancon and I’ve got a full set of hanbin pc from both debut and cb and all the POBs. Then it’s just things like voting or donations or birthdays gifts. I didn’t expect it to be much but at the end of the year I like to sort out my banking and yeah I’ll admit I was shocked myself 😭</p>
