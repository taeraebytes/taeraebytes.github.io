      <p>i have a fic but there's not really a ship and also it's fucking nct dream and heavily eating disorder focused do you still want it ðŸ˜­ i also have a non-romantic HARRY POTTER one idgaf it's one of the best fanfics i've ever read and even though most hp fics are shit i still dig around there bc they still have 500k fics that's modern day library of alexandria.</p>
