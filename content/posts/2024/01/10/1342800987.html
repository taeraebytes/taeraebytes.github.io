      <p>? seems like anon wants him to be fatherless so bad I don't get it, wdym ppl weren't lying? All these are assumptions and Ricky mentioned him once during a radio interview, saying his father was worried being an idol wouldn't make good money but I guess that's not enough, I mean those words came out of Rickys own mouth but you believe some twt user and their baseless assumptions instead.

tbh I rather fans think he's fatherless because that way they don't dig into his fathers business. Look what they did to his moms clothing business it's still closed to this day and they can't stop stalking his sisters, who are minors btw like you guys are kinda physco trying to dm them for tea.. Also keep in mind his father was able to bring his entire family from Shanghai to California and live lavishly, his father is on another level and prob really busy with work and just because of that it doesn't mean he has no father... Wait till u get married and when u see your parents only on birthdays, thanksgiving and christmas/ new years 💀 These fatherless takes are so dramatic tbh that I can't help but rant.</p>

      <p>Wait I didn't know his mom closed business damn but yea he's not fatherless and I don't think his dad was really worried he just seemed against the idea of being an idol. And I hope them little girls aren't getting bothered 😭 his dads just not around
