      <p>well not tea but let's stir up the pot...

don't you think that zerocolas and gyubrickers (idk their ship fandom) also act insane on those fancalls bc hao, kinda feeds into it? like if you compare hanbin answers he's not even doing all that, his answers are more normal meanwhile hao it's 2 seconds away from being gyuvin 2.0. for example, people attacked the op that asked the "is there a thing that you feel like you can't do without hanbin?" the question wasn't even bad, and they asked gyuvin the same question previously but the question took a whole new path when hao started talking about how his body is cold while hanbin body is warm and all that... hao please be serious.

meanwhile for gyubrick, yeah gyuvin doing too much but ricky also says insane things too... gyuvin takes the cake but it's not like ricky is innocent either.</p>

      <p>i feel like they know which type of fan theyre talking to ( shippers, gf stans, normal ones) and hao is a people pleaser and tries hard and perhaps go overboard to satisfy the fan‚Äôs needs in fansigns.. also hao always gets the brunt of haobin shippers (they lash out on him on bbl and some even send hate on wb if hes not interacting w hanbin ‚Äòproperly‚Äô) so maybe thats why 

i do agree some of his answers are unhinged but lately i feel like he looks not as enthusiastic as he used to be in fansigns?? idk everytime he talks to a shipper his face is giving ‚Äúlets just get this shit over with‚Äù but thats prolly just me</p>

      <p>anon maybe right because he's not like this before melting point era, idk what wakeone told him to because i feel something about haobin dynamic after bunch of zerocolas threatening to boycott if there's no haobin moment, now he answer those question with "you want me to answer with something like this right" and give them the most unhinged answerüò≠</p>
