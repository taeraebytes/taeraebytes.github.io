You just know sm stans would be the biggest insufferables about vocal technique if riize were actually the best ðŸ’€ but they can't so they start talking like hybe stans instead</p>

      <p>sorry but u sound dumb having these vocalist convos bc 95% of u arenâ€™t even vocalists or singers. yâ€™all do not see anyone arguing abt this shit outside of kpop stans. but if u want to compare them to hybe, riize is better than newjeans, txt, le sserafim, enhypen, bnd, bts, fromis. theyâ€™re also not even the worst in sm and they just debuted.</p>

      <p>No he is I'm not a jaehyun fan like that but skill wise he's slightly better than xiaojun, id also add Jungkook and I do personally think haechan is better from what we've seen so far</p>

      <p>Slightly better than Xiaojun??? Jaehyuns like a lead vocal while he's main jungkook is definitely really good but idk id put this as 
xiaojun 
jungkook
haechan = jaehyun 
sohee I think him having a rlly pretty tone helps him out 

actually I'm not sure for the last 3 but xiaojun first jungkook second definitely
