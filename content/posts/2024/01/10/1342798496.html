You just know sm stans would be the biggest insufferables about vocal technique if riize were actually the best 💀 but they can't so they start talking like hybe stans instead</p>

      <p>sorry but u sound dumb having these vocalist convos bc 95% of u aren’t even vocalists or singers. y’all do not see anyone arguing abt this shit outside of kpop stans. but if u want to compare them to hybe, riize is better than newjeans, txt, le sserafim, enhypen, bnd, bts, fromis. they’re also not even the worst in sm and they just debuted.</p>
