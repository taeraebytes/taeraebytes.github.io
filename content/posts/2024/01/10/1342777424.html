      <p>My take on the visuals of the group and I have multiple for reasons, no bias and I'm not ranking them either just whoever comes to mind first. 

Yujin, main visual. Fits all beauty standards not just Korean, if he wasn't a minor or was in SM this conversation wouldn't even be a thing. He'd be trending on all forums for his visuals without the need of payola and forced articles because he IS a visual. No shade ;) But because he isn't in big4 gp dgaf. Reason why I mentioned minor is because us Westerners think if you compliment a minor ur automatically a pedo so a lot of us deny the fact that he is good looking.

Hao/ Hanbin, visual + they fit the kbs, soft and boy next door/ uni student vibes. Girls and guys would want to go to school for a chance to see them in the hallways that kinda visual.

Ricky, visual but really depends of preference, for me he is. Has strong unique features which is appealing to westerners + does not fit kbs. Because he doesn't fit kbs when he's amongst other members/ idols he stands out in a good way. But when he's wearing stage makeup + contacts I can see why some people say he sticks out too much because he looks ai/ out of this world compare to the rest. Although I prefer light makeup + no contacts on him I can see why he always go viral for it and again, based of preference a lot of people like that aesthetic but some don't.

Jiwoong, visual but also depends on preference. Strong features but most of his features fit kbs - the veneers. Has features koreans like especially in actors and I can see why Koreans call him a visual and why wakeone is so adamant on pushing him. 

Gunwook, potential visual, depends on preference like Jiwoong but unlike Jiwoong, Gunwook has a mix of strong and soft features + some of his features fit kbs + has good proportions. First impression can be intimidating but once he smiles all the intimidations goes away.

Gyuvin, rather than a visual I think he has the best proportions which can boost your visuals. Kbs are obsessed with small heads so he fits that to a tea but face feature wise I think he's average but I can see the puppy face fans see in him and why some consider him a visual. 

Matthew, not a visual but cute and endearing in his own way, does not fit kbs at all face and proportion wise.

Taerae, controversial take but I can see him being a visual if you're into the nerdy/ loser (in a good way) aesthetic but not a lot do so he's not a visual, doesn't fit kbs. 

Conclusion, I'm glad Zb1 has all different types of visuals/ non visuals and not just the generic kbs stereotype face and because of that they can attract different fans with different preferences and they stand out individually.</p>

      <p>Yujin agree they treat him weirdly cuz he's 16 it's ok you can say he looks good it's not illegalðŸ˜­

I feel like hao and hanbin have rlly different visuals

Ricky kind of doesn't and does fit it but because a lot of people think he's handsome it doesn't rlly matter too much I think he just has to be your type

Jiwoong I feel like people can agree he's a visual but a lottt of people just don't like his type plus they kind of declined because of the Botox 

Gunwook doesn't fit the kbs but that doesn't mean anything ab ur looks I strongly think he would've been well received when the standards leaned less towards teeny alien faces like 3rd Gen but he's growing into his face and he's losing a bunch of baby fat which I'm sad ab but he's gotten prettier 

Gyuvin I feel like fits the standards to a T and has really good proportions just not my type personally but he's been looking a lot better recently and he's considered a visual 

Matthew is just cute to me like, yknow when ppl categorize handsome cute pretty etc. he's real cute and he needs better styling 

Taerae has that nice nerdy ballad singer look which I've been liking these days he's not a visual but a lot of Koreans like his face 

Me too I agree they look diff but I feel like they're starting to have somewhat of a harmonious visual that makes them look more like a group
