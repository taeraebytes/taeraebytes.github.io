      <p>i feel like i never see the membersâ€™ acknowledge the otherâ€™s birthdays that much outside of the letters in birthday lives and idrc bc that shouldnâ€™t be a measure of their friendship but like idt iâ€™ve seen any of the members get as many birthday wishes from the other members as gunwook has today like wow he really kinged out</p>
