      <p>hmmmmmm I think dance line minus yujin are pretty charismatic on stage but they have their own issues sometimes I think it depends on the song for them but overall hao might have the best stage presence he's pretty solid and after gunwook he was the cutest to me in mp

      <p>I think so too but "without being biased" just means don't say gunwook dndnjgmdjkfmfkd I can admit he can get a little too powerful on stage but he's one of the greatest and hao is so fun to watch
