      <p>i feel like i never see the members’ acknowledge the other’s birthdays that much outside of the letters in birthday lives and idrc bc that shouldn’t be a measure of their friendship but like idt i’ve seen any of the members get as many birthday wishes from the other members as gunwook has today like wow he really kinged out</p>
