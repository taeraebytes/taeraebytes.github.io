      <p>A little bit TMI but a year ago I went to Korea for the first time I always regret not going to a lot of kpop related things but I did apply for artist battle boys planet and got in, at the time I didn't really have a fave but I came out as a Ricky fan from over me ðŸ˜­ But honestly that was one of the worst days of my life, I had no idea we had to wait for 6 hours with no food and drink the hottest venue possible, no phones but the whole process was so interesting. Btw everything is really structured I've never been to a live audience so I didn't know, but they tell you when to scream when the mc comes in and the waits between the groups were sooo long! Anyways I can give you some review if you want but I don't want to type too long but I love ur cc haha</p>
