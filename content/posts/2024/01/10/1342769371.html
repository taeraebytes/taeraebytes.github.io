      <p>rosins would be shitting themselves and crying if they saw any zeroses or subfandom using a twibbon unrelated to hao on his birthday let's be honest. it isn't that deep but it's kpop and people will find any reason to be upset so don't pretend there wouldn't be a damn hashtag about respecting hao if the situation was reversed</p>

      <p>I'm seriously not even trying to be slick idw be mean but idols do not write their profiles it's always staff and the companies that lie on their behalf it's less common for female idols but the ones that are rlly short get their heights bumped up it's just an age old thing. I was talking about this for zb1 not long ago half of them are lying too
