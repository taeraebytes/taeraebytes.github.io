      <p>while its fucking stupid and they shouldn't have involved anyone else they aren't dragging either of them. they're saying they are on the account more than other members which isn't even true. it's someone wanting to ruin hanbin and by association zb1's reputation, this one could actually effect the whole group. i'm embarrassed fr why did they send in the first place</p>
