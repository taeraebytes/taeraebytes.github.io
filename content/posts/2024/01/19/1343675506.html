      <p>you should check pannchoas post about the trucks haos akgaes sent. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ they are getting detroyed in the comments of the korean sites version. yes it is known to be from hao akgaes since theres a ss going around of three people talking about these trucks back on 15th january. the idea of putting sohee and jaehyuns name was kinda last minute according to those screenshots ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>The truth is that you guys will look crazy bc y'all are trying to implement c-pop fan culture here when that shit doesn't matter in kpop. Do you think riize fans get angry at Wonbin and Anton getting more push than other members? Or BND Jaehyun getting all the gigs? No, no one cares.</p>
