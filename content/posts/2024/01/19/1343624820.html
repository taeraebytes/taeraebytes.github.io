      <p>while its fucking stupid and they shouldn't have involved anyone else they aren't dragging either of them. they're saying they are on the account more than other members which isn't even true. it's someone wanting to ruin hanbin and by association zb1's reputation, this one could actually effect the whole group. i'm embarrassed fr why did they send in the first place</p>

      <p>imagine if this blows up on kr forums and hanbin has to apologize to sohee and jaehyun at the mcountdown backstage... if this man starts smoking it would be justified i think</p>
