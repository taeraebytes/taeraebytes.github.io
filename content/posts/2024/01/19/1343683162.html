      <p>I think the only unfortunate members are taerae and gyuvin every member has at least a county or a few where they're 1 or 2 so it's really not disproportionate it's typical for kpop even in korea the popularity isn't as disproportional as people make it seem

      <p>taerae only cares abt singing and pubg or whatever heâ€™s playing so heâ€™ll be fine and if i were guivin i would rather have no fans than only trolls who dunk on me 24/7 and shippers</p>
