      <p>you should check pannchoas post about the trucks haos akgaes sent. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ they are getting detroyed in the comments of the korean sites version. yes it is known to be from hao akgaes since theres a ss going around of three people talking about these trucks back on 15th january. the idea of putting sohee and jaehyuns name was kinda last minute according to those screenshots ðŸ˜‚</p>
