      <p>non-romantic fics are sooo hard to find but i try anyway bc those are my fav ðŸ˜­

<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25568533/chapters/62047072">https://archiveofourown.org/works/25568533/chapters/62047072</a> this is the eating disorder jaemin-centric nct dream fic i don't actually stan nct dream like that so it's probably ooc but when i read it a few years ago i liked it a lot


<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669">https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669</a> this is a harry potter snape-centric fic: ok i hate snape so much and i ignore most fics where he's good, so i never expected to enjoy this fic, but this is a universe where he was never actually a death eater and he was a triple agent the entire time, so his lonely life becomes incredibly sad considering he didn't do much wrong</p>

      <p>ok i mispoke sorry, i don't actually dislike him in canon but i do hate the fics that focus on him and try to make him a good father figure or whatever for harry because he's not like that at all c'mon ðŸ˜­ his character in the actual harry potter series as a grouchy, hung-up, resentful morally gray guy is actually interesting</p>

      <p>diff anon, sorry to continue hp discourse but rather then his character bc he was pretty interesting i hated how he and dumbledore were turned into some kind of heroes in the end, dumbledore completely treated harry as a disposable tool to achieve what he wanted and let him stay with abusive relatives to basically humble him which he said himself and snape didnâ€™t care if the husband and the child of the love of his life died and when vld went against the promose and killed her he was just pissed at that and that was the only reason he switched sides, not bc he had some kind of realisation and only hated harry slightly  less bc he had his mothers eyes or wtv + he still was very abusive to literal children for all of his life to the point nevil feared him more than someone who killed his parents, and after all of that harry named his son after these two people?</p>

i dont even think anyone is reading these but dfjgkfgh

this is a fic in which hogwarts starts when someone is 14 instead of 11, which means of course harry is stuck with his abusive relatives for three more years, and the fic is about harry's pre-hogwarts life. it focuses quite a lot on the dursleys and their impact on harry, and harry is quite resentful of dumbledore at the end when he does meet him</p>
