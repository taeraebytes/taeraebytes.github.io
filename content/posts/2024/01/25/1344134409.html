      <p>Sometimes I think about how lesserafim's trajectory is going to be because they started off the same way itzy did: strong dancers, strong performers but weak vocalists. But itzy's career haven't reached their rookie era peaks +  they also are dealing with chronic injuries because of how hardcore their choreo used to be so they had to tone down their performances which was what they were known for. On top of that their vocals are weak which has pretty much limited them conceptually and song wise as well. 

I wonder if lesserafim would be able to maintain the level of success they're having how without having to sacrifice what they're known for.</p>

      <p>Frankly itzy at least made an effort to always sing live lesserafim are really REALLY bad, they do have more of the visuals men like like I've noticed they have a lot of male fans in ea and have a strong japanese fanbase and public friendly songs so they'll be fine I think</p>
