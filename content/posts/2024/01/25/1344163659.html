      <p>The best fandom fanfic wise are always the Chinese bls I usually don't like bls but once you get the world building they're so good and then the fics are also like, crazy high quality
Kpop I think NCT had some of the best fics I've ever read but I must say haobin have a lot of great ones like for the like 2k zb1 fics on ao3 I feel like the percentage of good ones is way higher than other big fandoms</p>
