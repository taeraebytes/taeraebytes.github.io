      <p>😭😭😭😭😭 I actually don’t know how it accumulated so fast but like all the magazines, I bought that bring green perfume, things from their collabs like romantic crown and the spao pjs. The merch and stuff like from the fancon and I’ve got a full set of hanbin pc from both debut and cb and all the POBs. Then it’s just things like voting or donations or birthdays gifts. I didn’t expect it to be much but at the end of the year I like to sort out my banking and yeah I’ll admit I was shocked myself 😭</p>

      <p>The pyjamas haven’t gotten to me yet so I’m hoping they aren’t too short 😭 I’m tryna cut down on spending too much but like you said it will probably get worse this year and I have poor self control 💀 plus if they do end up going on tour I’ll definitely fly myself out to the nearest stop to the uk as a self 21st birthday present 😂</p>
