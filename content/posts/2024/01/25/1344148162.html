      <p>i have a fic but there's not really a ship and also it's fucking nct dream and heavily eating disorder focused do you still want it ðŸ˜­ i also have a non-romantic HARRY POTTER one idgaf it's one of the best fanfics i've ever read and even though most hp fics are shit i still dig around there bc they still have 500k fics that's modern day library of alexandria.</p>

      <p>non-romantic fics are sooo hard to find but i try anyway bc those are my fav ðŸ˜­

<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25568533/chapters/62047072">https://archiveofourown.org/works/25568533/chapters/62047072</a> this is the eating disorder jaemin-centric nct dream fic i don't actually stan nct dream like that so it's probably ooc but when i read it a few years ago i liked it a lot


<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669">https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669</a> this is a harry potter snape-centric fic: ok i hate snape so much and i ignore most fics where he's good, so i never expected to enjoy this fic, but this is a universe where he was never actually a death eater and he was a triple agent the entire time, so his lonely life becomes incredibly sad considering he didn't do much wrong</p>

      <p>ok i mispoke sorry, i don't actually dislike him in canon but i do hate the fics that focus on him and try to make him a good father figure or whatever for harry because he's not like that at all c'mon ðŸ˜­ his character in the actual harry potter series as a grouchy, hung-up, resentful morally gray guy is actually interesting</p>
