      <p>😭😭😭😭😭 I actually don’t know how it accumulated so fast but like all the magazines, I bought that bring green perfume, things from their collabs like romantic crown and the spao pjs. The merch and stuff like from the fancon and I’ve got a full set of hanbin pc from both debut and cb and all the POBs. Then it’s just things like voting or donations or birthdays gifts. I didn’t expect it to be much but at the end of the year I like to sort out my banking and yeah I’ll admit I was shocked myself 😭</p>

      <p>The pyjamas haven’t gotten to me yet so I’m hoping they aren’t too short 😭 I’m tryna cut down on spending too much but like you said it will probably get worse this year and I have poor self control 💀 plus if they do end up going on tour I’ll definitely fly myself out to the nearest stop to the uk as a self 21st birthday present 😂</p>

      <p>I’m actually convinced there’s some embezzlement going on there because there’s no way they have made literal millions of $ of profit and still be acting like they haven’t got a penny to spare for the boys 😭</p>

      <p>this might sound mean but idc anymore and its why im glad theyre not extending keps contract because theyre so unprofitable. extending contracts is only good for keps sake cause lets be honest, as a group theyre already nugu and even more nugu individually. 

Them going back to their og company is legit a death sentence to their career as an idol cause individually they bring no value, I cant really see any of them debutting.. Maybe mashiro and hikaru will have something back in Japan cause their japanese market was breaking even at least... maybe chaehyun will do ost type music and maybe xiaoting will return to china and go into acting or judge for a chinese talent show but thats all. If hiyyih debuts again its because of her brothers hype and even her brothers hype isnt carrying her anymore. I blame wakeone that none of them made a name of themselves but lets be honest once again, none of them really had that star factor to being with. Lineup was shit.</p>
