      <p>Batter up is just a standard fun kpop song why do ppl want every song to be so modern , I feel like they only hated cause everyone was dead set on hating bp's little sisters or yg new group , if kiss of life released it everyone would like it</p>

      <p>People were posting the chorus alone which can be a lot of you don't like that kinda music but all together it's so good and it's not like they said they were going to be making critically acclaimed music like just shut up but everyone likes it now
