      <p>who do we think is winning roty at sma. bc i thought zb1 secured it but the official prediction account says riize. the tracking period is through december so idk if originally was zb1 and then riize just surpassed them bc it’s yits vs gag and gag is still getting digital points. and then some zeroses r saying the prediction is inaccurate but zeroses r delusional sometimes so idk if they’re telling the truth</p>

      <p>babys it's PLAVE but even with the criteria judges matter a lot right? Zb1 have the best physicals by a mile and plave has the best digitalis riize 2nd but the gap between riize and zb1 isn't too big plave has the actual gap there but we'll see zb1 have a better chance than riize if plave somehow don't win
