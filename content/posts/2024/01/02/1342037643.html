      <p>it comes off arrogant and people are bringing up giselle and how she got tore up for a rumor. its witty to ur avg stan twt user but everyone else is taking it wrong ig and a lot of people are bringing up the fact that if a female idol had said this it would be over for her which is true to a degree

      <p>oh bitch if this was a female idol they would even be yapping about how "weird" she is for using a song talking about race and gender to talk about being born privileged or something like that</p>

      <p>at the end of the day anton is still a first gen asian american so yeah he’s privileged w money but like that doesn’t take away that he was a minority growing up so i don’t see how it’s offensive also it’s not that deep it’s a song ppl need to grow up and he had every right to defend himself</p>
