      <p>let's talk about Yuri x Song Yejin x Han Yeseul. Like, do we believe the old tea? Because it would be so fun but at the same time, Han Yeseul how do you go for Yuri but then end up dating YG producer Teddy Park ðŸ˜­, and now she's dating some man that iirc he used to be an scort or something like that. For Song Yejin, at least she had better taste bc Hyunbin is sexy as hell and she got married and now has a family so good for her. Yuri taste in men is shit too, that nasty ugly ass baseball player ... I still get nightmares bc of her dating that man, thank god they broke up</p>
