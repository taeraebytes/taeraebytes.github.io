      <p>theyre not but being called a nepo baby isnt bullying and its not like its false eitherðŸ˜­ its just dumb because now he will forever be labeled one most nepos grow out of it in a few yrs and like i said it was meant for a specific audience if it stayed there this wouldnt be happening

      <p>i see where ur coming from but u have to be dense if u donâ€™t think ppl use nepo baby as a drag and to discredit his abilities and hard work. itâ€™s not bullying but itâ€™s annoying and op deserved to be humbled. most ppl r on his side abt this anyways itâ€™s only the jobless freaks on twt trying to start shit abt it</p>

      <p>yea I get that it's obv op was using it as a drag but I'm like 100% sure he knew what he was getting himself into debuting whether his father helped him debut or not is unknown but the fact that he's his son will allllways follow him esp they're gonna collabðŸ˜­ it's just not a norm to respond to things like this and it was for op and just tiktok comments people being upset at what he said which is mostly kfans is mostly due to cultural context differences. And even to regular twt users it can come off as arrogant because generally people just don't like nepo babies and there's been a surge in nepo baby hate after that vanity fair article, but most of that is just them trynna drag Anton ngl. Like I said it's also a lot of kbriizes mad too so it's not because they're trynna drag but I don't think it's a big deal and it's humorous for tiktok and twt user which was who it was meant for. That's my piece I'm sure if I ulted him tho I would've been wishing death but I like him and this is just what I think

      <p>yeah i get u iâ€™m just hyperfixated on him atm and am literally cursing anybody who speaks on him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i think idols r starting to be more raw and like clapping back, or at least thatâ€™s how heâ€™s always been and iâ€™ll always applaud ppl who arenâ€™t afraid to speak their mind despite what others might have to say abt it. anyways ik u donâ€™t stan but have u seen the teaser for the riize cb i love their whole 90s retro vibe and the video looks pretty. the lofi instrumental is nice too</p>

      <p>winter + school concept + lofi instrumental korea will eat it up. i donâ€™t think itâ€™s a ballad tho the drum beat is too pronounced. but also u canâ€™t rly tell what itâ€™ll sound like until the whole thing comes out vocals add alot to a song</p>
