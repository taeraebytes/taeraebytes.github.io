      <p>Agree with everything. I can’t believe Jiwoong fans used to make us think he was gay and that him getting no cheers was homophobia, lol. I do think Ricky is straight tho, but at the same time I remember that he was an art major at ocsa ( if you’re confused and want me to explain this to you I will)  + has those alleged rumors from the older guy</p>
