      <p>I am sorry but I will always find the whole kpop manager thing so weird and awkward. The fact that I've heard thousands of stories from groups saying that they had to even share room with managers, like them sharing dorm with them it's already awkward but when you also hear that they share room with them and everything, it becomes weirder. Especially bc even if the manager is not weird or anything, I will never be fine with grown ass men sharing rooms with minors.</p>

      <p>i get the sentiment of a manager being with them most of the time but i dont think they should be sharing rooms and shit thats so weird. ig its convenient to live tgthr tho because a manager would basically have to hassle to keep up but yea room thing is very weird
