      <p>staff members are supposed to be nice and close with them... i remember than when i was a BP fan the girls had an amazing relationship with their managers, even when one of them stole Lisa's money but yeah they were close. it's just that some of those managers that zb1 has are a bunch of horrid fads.</p>
