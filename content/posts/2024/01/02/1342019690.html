      <p>no it’s getting lowkey racist tbh ppl didn’t even listen to kfans concerns that the joke the gyuvin made is possibly making fun of disabled people and chalked it up to “ugh those stupid kfans”. they did the same thing a couple months ago when that one korean lesbian tried to explain why the coming out joke made queer ppl in korea uncomfortable and ifans literally jumped her for it calling HER homophobic i hate zb1s ifans bro</p>

      <p>Yea they passed it off as hate when it's an issue that deserves to be taken seriously and that honestly pissed me off how are you going to tell a Korean lesbian about the state of koreas homophobia?!? They were trying to pass gyuvin off as some lgbt activist too just so dumb
