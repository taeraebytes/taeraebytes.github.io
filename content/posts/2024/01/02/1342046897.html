      <p>No because jihyo doesn't have just vocals she is a great dancer and most of all, a very passionate performer so she fits Hao way more imo
I also agree w Hanbin nayeon because he acts as a main vocal as those traditional visual, is cute, great performer
Taerae as Jeongyeon
Gunwook to me is Mina actually
Ricky is Tzuyu
Jiwoong Sana (sorry Sana but they have similar roles)
Yujin Momo
Gyuvin Dahyun
Matthew and Chae
Yes I got tired of explaining after 2 members what about it but it's not just about skills but the role they play in the group</p>
