      <p>it comes off arrogant and people are bringing up giselle and how she got tore up for a rumor. its witty to ur avg stan twt user but everyone else is taking it wrong ig and a lot of people are bringing up the fact that if a female idol had said this it would be over for her which is true to a degree

      <p>oh bitch if this was a female idol they would even be yapping about how "weird" she is for using a song talking about race and gender to talk about being born privileged or something like that</p>

      <p>at the end of the day anton is still a first gen asian american so yeah heâ€™s privileged w money but like that doesnâ€™t take away that he was a minority growing up so i donâ€™t see how itâ€™s offensive also itâ€™s not that deep itâ€™s a song ppl need to grow up and he had every right to defend himself</p>

      <p>he grew up in damn near little seoul his neighborhood in jersey is RUN by koreansðŸ˜­ also he went back and forth a lot but people will call anyone with connections nepo its just part of the game i dont think its a big deal just careless theres plenty of nepos in the industry and theyve outgrown their like "nepo" titles this would honestly just force this title on him for a longgggggg time

      <p>growing up around ur ppl doesnâ€™t mean u wonâ€™t face any racism like america is still run by white conservatives my public hs was 50% asian but racism was so normalized. and donâ€™t even get me started on how bad it got during the covid lockdown. either way knets canâ€™t b speaking on that</p>

      <p>i was just saying i grew up in a community thats run by my peopledem so his experience would be different than the more harrowing experiences of asian americans but its not the race part its the lgbt part and what the song is most know for thats upsetting ppl plus the gayo performance just happened

      <p>theyre not but being called a nepo baby isnt bullying and its not like its false eitherðŸ˜­ its just dumb because now he will forever be labeled one most nepos grow out of it in a few yrs and like i said it was meant for a specific audience if it stayed there this wouldnt be happening

      <p>i see where ur coming from but u have to be dense if u donâ€™t think ppl use nepo baby as a drag and to discredit his abilities and hard work. itâ€™s not bullying but itâ€™s annoying and op deserved to be humbled. most ppl r on his side abt this anyways itâ€™s only the jobless freaks on twt trying to start shit abt it</p>

      <p>yea I get that it's obv op was using it as a drag but I'm like 100% sure he knew what he was getting himself into debuting whether his father helped him debut or not is unknown but the fact that he's his son will allllways follow him esp they're gonna collabðŸ˜­ it's just not a norm to respond to things like this and it was for op and just tiktok comments people being upset at what he said which is mostly kfans is mostly due to cultural context differences. And even to regular twt users it can come off as arrogant because generally people just don't like nepo babies and there's been a surge in nepo baby hate after that vanity fair article, but most of that is just them trynna drag Anton ngl. Like I said it's also a lot of kbriizes mad too so it's not because they're trynna drag but I don't think it's a big deal and it's humorous for tiktok and twt user which was who it was meant for. That's my piece I'm sure if I ulted him tho I would've been wishing death but I like him and this is just what I think

      <p>yeah i get u iâ€™m just hyperfixated on him atm and am literally cursing anybody who speaks on him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i think idols r starting to be more raw and like clapping back, or at least thatâ€™s how heâ€™s always been and iâ€™ll always applaud ppl who arenâ€™t afraid to speak their mind despite what others might have to say abt it. anyways ik u donâ€™t stan but have u seen the teaser for the riize cb i love their whole 90s retro vibe and the video looks pretty. the lofi instrumental is nice too</p>

      <p>winter + school concept + lofi instrumental korea will eat it up. i donâ€™t think itâ€™s a ballad tho the drum beat is too pronounced. but also u canâ€™t rly tell what itâ€™ll sound like until the whole thing comes out vocals add alot to a song</p>
