      <p>oh please don't bring me to tears he is as so passionate yes he wasn't that talented but he's so fun and cute and a visual and had good dance lines ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he was so sick majority of filming and he just freaked out because he wanted the performance to go well yea and his screentime I think besides junhyeon he was the only trainee I was heart broken over

      <p>In earlier BP episodes, Cline was so loved by K-fans like Shanghaiz (Jinxin, MJX, Shuaibo, Ricky), Tianyu, and Hao. That Cha Eun Wook K-trolls account used to be a Shanghaiz fan account btw. But only Hao got the good screentime. but if they debut in korea they will have a big fandom</p>
