      <p>Clean rooms - hanbin/taerae gunwook/hao
messy - everyone else I would think Ricky's somewhat clean but not together with gyuvin and Matthew and yujin are said to be roommates? But people think they also have their own rooms because the manager has his own room allegedly so they're gonna be messier if they alone
