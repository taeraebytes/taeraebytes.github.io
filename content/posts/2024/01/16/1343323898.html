Really nosey and me and my friends found two of his old LA friends profile on xiaohongshu and weibo early on during Boys Planet. I scrolled through all their media dating back to 2014 and I recognize all their faces. I know I'm physco ðŸ˜­ I even messaged one of them in chn back in January last year and he replied back nothing crazy, I just asked him if the pictures in the group pics was Ricky from Boys Planet on Tiktok and if they were his friends and he said yes but he and that group of friends just drifted apart. So maybe this is what u guys are talking about, the \"cutting off\" bad influence.\n\nBut the thing is even if they ended on bad terms, groups pics with him were still on his profile and that friend documented his entire life on there before latam fans found it and started spreading the pics so he deleted his profile. That's why I don't think Ricky did any of the stuff op mentioned because there were clearly group pictures of his friends with other friends smoking and drinking but Ricky was never there, Ricky was only in the ones where they're drinking bubble tea or outside restaurants taking 04 eboy pics in their designer clothes and cars ðŸ˜­ They're also the same group of friends who leaked his old selfies. Idk why they saved his selfies but they did so if there was any dirt on Ricky they would've leaked it but theres nothing except selfies and 04 pics. I feel like we all want him to be this unhinged foreign exchange student but I really do believe he was just a quiet kid who didn't care for that kinda stuff. Which is kinda cute ngl",

Awww yea he just always seemed like a cute kid to me I do believe that whole bad influence thing but who knows what he did there's nothing direct to him. And oh they're fakeeee for leaking stuff I do think they're probably feeling a little jealousy towards him as well cuz I know two have been on Chinese survival show groups so the success is probably killing them"

      <p>saw this way back and if u were there back then op gives me mad petty vibes because he rejected her request to join her dance performance ðŸ˜­ it's again "his friend told us" but never actual screen shots or pics. He was just a quiet kid kid with anxiety and his friends were bad influence so he cut them off.</p>
