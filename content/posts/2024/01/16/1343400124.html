 bruh wk1 truly hates zhang hao like this is crazyâ€¦ not replying to the magazineâ€™s emails regarding promotion, causing the mag to have to contact haoâ€™s cbar to promote it?? wk1 didnâ€™t even let the teaser promo marinate for 4 hours before they told the mag to take it downðŸ’€ c-ent hates it when companies act all high and mighty like who will want to work with wk1 after they act like this?? c-ent rly values sales data too and by not letting them promote his magazine how are fans supposed to be prepared to buy it. wk1 couldâ€™ve financially benefit from the huge sales this mag would bring but they still chose to sabotage zhang hao like thisðŸ’€ this is so fucked up</p>

      <p>I don't think they hate him but I really can't understand why ask them to take it down? Do they not want to promote it because it's a Chinese magazine? I'm really confused</p>
