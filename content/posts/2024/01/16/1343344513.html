      <p>Btw, around the time when the first episode of boys planet aired on the discord someone started sending pics of Ricky that we've never seen and this person claimed that they used to be really close with Ricky then they started asking people on the discord if they wanted to know Ricky sexuality and everyone was weirded out so the mods kicked them out</p>
