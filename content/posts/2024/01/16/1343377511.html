taerae had one clout chasing friend but outside of that it's fine

gyuvin is always yapping about his friends but they don't talk about him so mhm ok

hanbin friends were making pr for him during BP everywhere, the most decent ones deffo except for that other one who thought it was a good idea to post that clip of them talking about going to bars 

yujin friends are fine too, they don't mention him that much either

matty friends are good too
