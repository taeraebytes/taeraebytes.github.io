      <p>saw this way back and if u were there back then op gives me mad petty vibes because he rejected her request to join her dance performance ðŸ˜­ it's again "his friend told us" but never actual screen shots or pics. He was just a quiet kid kid with anxiety and his friends were bad influence so he cut them off.</p>

      <p>Can I confess my sins? I can't hold it in anymore. I'm nosey. Really nosey and me and my friends found two of his old LA friends profile on xiaohongshu and weibo early on during Boys Planet. I scrolled through all their media dating back to 2014 and I recognize all their faces. I know I'm physco ðŸ˜­ I even messaged one of them in chn back in January last year and he replied back nothing crazy, I just asked him if the pictures in the group pics was Ricky from Boys Planet on Tiktok and if they were his friends and he said yes but he and that group of friends just drifted apart. So maybe this is what u guys are talking about, the "cutting off" bad influence.

But the thing is even if they ended on bad terms, groups pics with him were still on his profile and that friend documented his entire life on there before latam fans found it and started spreading the pics so he deleted his profile. That's why I don't think Ricky did any of the stuff op mentioned because there were clearly group pictures of his friends with other friends smoking and drinking but Ricky was never there, Ricky was only in the ones where they're drinking bubble tea or outside restaurants taking 04 eboy pics in their designer clothes and cars ðŸ˜­ They're also the same group of friends who leaked his old selfies. Idk why they saved his selfies but they did so if there was any dirt on Ricky they would've leaked it but theres nothing except selfies and 04 pics. I feel like we all want him to be this unhinged foreign exchange student but I really do believe he was just a quiet kid who didn't care for that kinda stuff. Which is kinda cute ngl</p>

      <p>Sis it's ok this is all public info if it wasn't you it was gonna be others well which that happened I rmbr I spent all night on korean Facebook looking for gunwook predebut pics which I found one that's I've never seen before. Awww yea he just always seemed like a cute kid to me I do believe that whole bad influence thing but who knows what he did there's nothing direct to him. And oh they're fakeeee for leaking stuff I do think they're probably feeling a little jealousy towards him as well cuz I know two have been on Chinese survival show groups so the success is probably killing them

      <p>It was so EASY I just went on Weibo and typed in Ricky in english and no one is named Ricky there plus it was really early on Boys Planet like early January so even easier since no one really knew him and the only thing shown was pr videos. So I saw just saw this one post that said "is this Ricky that we used to know?" but in chn on Ricky was in eng and that's how it started, went on his profile and he had his xiaohongshu linked.

The group pics you all seen btw and were the only ones posted on his profile with Ricky in it, the beach one at night with two dudes, bubble tea group pic, another group pic where hes holding a detached arm? I think it was for Halloween because I remember seeing the date and another group pic where Ricky is holding the camera. Then the selfies that he leaked was with teddy bear shirt, hawaiian looking shirt, the one with grey hair and a bag skittles in the background and the last one was the mirror pic with black hair and white/ black stripe shirt. 

All the solo pics of Ricky posing predebut are also from him/ his friends but it was on Rickys profile and they just saved it, which again weird. The only pictures I don't know who leaked are the ones where he's playing guitar at church/ school and when he was little playing soccer and petting a bunny. I think those were leaked by his teachers though ðŸ˜­ ðŸ’€</p>
