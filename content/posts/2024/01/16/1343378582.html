    "question": "\"Ricky had a crush on her\" I think the opposite. she had a crush on him. I mean she literally called herself a simp and bragged how he would send her fit checks on midnight to the point other people started making dirty jokes about It and she laughed along. not sure if she liked him back then or she's just saying all that now because \"I should've appreciated more back then\" like sounds she regrets that she didn't get closer to him because he's famous now. idk this girl is kinda weird to me like",
    "reply": "I mean whos sending someone fit pics and selfies at midnight to see if they look good like been there done that I think she probably did too but the thing is I've seen how friends of idols act and she was ok she was being egged on at first idk I read the messages and I didn't see anything too crazy or thought she was weird she definitely could've carried herself better but she seemed genuine and also just giddy like everyone has a clout chasing side to them if not she would've kept it to herself also she was prob like 18 so it's not like she was going to make the upmost choices"

      <p>Btw, around the time when the first episode of boys planet aired on the discord someone started sending pics of Ricky that we've never seen and this person claimed that they used to be really close with Ricky then they started asking people on the discord if they wanted to know Ricky sexuality and everyone was weirded out so the mods kicked them out</p>

      <p>Anon who confessed their sins for being nosey here and I'm here to debunk this because I heard of this. That picture was first uploaded onto weibo by the his old friend that I stalked, around the same time when I found his friends profile 3 other chinese fans found his profile as well and wanted to see pics of Ricky so he shared I think 3 of Ricky's old selfies and then like 1 week later latam fans found his profile and started sharing the selfies + group pics and then I think a week after latam fans shared it, it started popping up on discord and onto twitter. 

His friend that I stalked barely spoke english and only uses chinese apps so there's no way that discord person is any of his friends and it's why I had to ask him in chn. Just saying a lot of people say stuff for attention.</p>

      <p>tbh does that really debunk anything tho? the discord user could've been a chinese speaker who was close to his friends and shared the pics from their socials. i have the boys planet discord server they're talking about and did searching bc u can see messages from users who have left servers (i'm nosy as fuck, sorry anon) and they mentioned being in shanghai with him in one of the pics they deleted (they also could've been lying but like yeah, idk if anything's actually debunked SO it is suspicious but not debunked. u should just take it all with a huge grain of salt, especially bc all the actual information was deleted from the server due to privacy lmao)</p>

      <p>Anon who confessed here and it does debunk it in my opinion. Because again the pictures were first shared onto Weibo by his old friends then weeks/ months later it started popping up on Discord/ Twitter because latam fans found and leaked them. If his friends wanted to share/ gossip about Ricky why didn't they do so when they were dropping all those pictures on Weibo while in their native language? They never said anything other than they used to be friends and hung out at boba shops and liked Kpop.

It just doesn't make sense because when me, my friend and the three other Chinese fans were on his profile asking for pictures his other friends also came by and dropped pics too. That's why I keep saying him/ his friends because the photos weren't from one person alone. They collectively dropped all the pics they had of Ricky, the group pics were already on his profile but the solo pics/ selfies of Ricky were on Rickys old xiaohongshu. The Chinese fans didn't care and asked a bunch of invasive questions and the only thing worth tea is they said they were friends, like his only friends he hung out with but Ricky kept to himself most of the time and didn't share much about himself. How he was the friend where you only talk with when other friends are around, like you wouldn't talk to him one on one. Was what I got from the translation. And then 1 week later Latam fans found the profile and bombarded our peaceful sharing season and started asking a bunch of questions in both english and chn but again they only ever said they used to hang out and couldn't believe he was on Boys Planet. 

So it doesn't make sense why'd they suddenly go on discord weeks later and say everything the contradicts what they told us.</p>

      <p>These were his old school friends? Or friends back in Shanghai because there's no way they couldn't speak English if they attended school in la. But damnnnn I would've been pissed if I were you I think there's a possibility the person in the discord was the girl he hung out with a few times? Idk but miskeen Ricky was so quiet wow

      <p>The ones I talked to on Weibo were his friends from LA, all the cali beach/ boba group pics are them and one of his old friends was from Shanghai but only knew Ricky when they were in LA. They know eng, bare minimum though and basic enough to hold a conversation. I know cause I stalked them too when they started comment and dropping pics ðŸ˜­

They were the type of exchange students that "went" to school just to stay in America and their groupies were all other Chinese exchange students so they always conversed in Chinese, they lived in a neighborhood known for other rich Chinese immigrants where shops and restaurants are also all Chinese. Rickys old xiaohongshu was public iirc, some of his classmates followed him there if they knew about the app, he even had a lil fanbase on there apparently. I know because the three Chinese fans asked why his pics are so extravagant but I guess when Ricky cut them off he closed his acc but his whole friend group had mini fanbases on xiaohongshu from other Chinese exchange students or Chinese people in China fantasying the Cali lifestyle. But some of the solo pics weren't posted on xiaohongshu and are personal from his old friends so you can't find it there but we've all seen them.

His old friends were insistent that if anyone, they were the closest to him and kinda shaded him by the way they said they were saying they're his only friends and how he'd rather go to school than hang out with the ONLY friends he had. Like word for word that's what they said translated and emphasized 'only' a lot. Idk about discord again all pics were posted after weibo so I don't trust them to begin with but there's nothing wrong with befriending classmates.</p>

      <p>they sound like shit from a butt.. and I'm not surprised Ricky was popular I'm glad he cut them off cuz I read all the discord messages the girl seems to be telling the truth and she truly had a lot of the older pics that were dropped cuz she was in them she mentioned he'd send them to her for fit checks at midnightðŸ˜­ lollllll he's so cute I believe you and this girl they both make sense to me at least but they are really not shit wow

      <p>Sorry for the late reply I'm doing homework at the same time. Can I ask when the pictures were shared on discord? Because latam invaded us around the second week of Jan then leaked it and I started see the pics show up on twitter around the third/ fourth week of Jan. 

I found his old friends weibo like 1 day after Rickys pr video ðŸ˜­ I'm fucking physco I'm sorry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ So the first week of Jan. Like I meant it when I said early on Boys Planet ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and then he/ his friend started sharing pics right away because they couldn't believe Ricky was on Boys Planet. The selfies are private btw, Ricky had another xiaohongshu with this friend group only, not public and none of his classmates followed him there. The grey hair with skittles in the bg, teddy bear shirt and black hair with black/white stripes I think were the only ones his old friends shared with us from his private xiaohongshu. So if the discord had any of those pics it was def from Weibo from latam fans leak.

But if it's him posing in front of his lambo, solo beach pics etc those are from his public xiaohongshu so those could be legit from his classmates.</p>

      <p>From what I got the friend was sharing pics and stuff january 23rd but she's confirmed a girl so there's that tbh I think Ricky had a crush on her. She said the se thing as well the gc with her friends went crazy when Ricky's pr video dropped they found out a little late ig? But she was a general kpop fan who was going to tune into bp and then boom she was shocked she send a ss of her gc being surprised that Ricky was in the show. She said everyone was going crazy. The pics she sent got deleted within the same day of sending them so I have no clue what they were or if they ever really leaked because it was a bunch of up tight people in the chatðŸ˜­ they mentioned gray hair a lot tho she showed his red hair too saying she liked the gray better
