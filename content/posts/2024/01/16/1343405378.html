      <p>as someone who was on that train sis I can't tell you it snowballed really fast it's so very easy to hate someone in a survival show setting so you know we all got too lit and just started going crazy it's not even his visuals everyone used to think he was cute before the articles came out it's just that he got the short end of the stick and people decided to expose him and shit was up
