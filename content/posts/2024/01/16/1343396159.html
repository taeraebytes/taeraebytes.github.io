      <p>I hate the fact that im saying this but Zerose need to take notes from Rosins. The way they're moving is impressive on the global side, the Korean side, or the Japanese side â€“ all of them are so organized their funds are like more than 50% completed for his OST already when Crush dropped, no one said anything or set a goal for the fandom to achieve we are all over the place as a fandom itâ€™s embarrassing. All we're good at is physical sales and sfs fights. I really don't want the boys to flop as a group the company needs to get their shit tgt, and we need to be much more organized and motivated to support them in the next cb as much as we can if dont want them to end up like kep1er ðŸ˜­</p>
