      <p>Btw, around the time when the first episode of boys planet aired on the discord someone started sending pics of Ricky that we've never seen and this person claimed that they used to be really close with Ricky then they started asking people on the discord if they wanted to know Ricky sexuality and everyone was weirded out so the mods kicked them out</p>

      <p>Anon who confessed their sins for being nosey here and I'm here to debunk this because I heard of this. That picture was first uploaded onto weibo by the his old friend that I stalked, around the same time when I found his friends profile 3 other chinese fans found his profile as well and wanted to see pics of Ricky so he shared I think 3 of Ricky's old selfies and then like 1 week later latam fans found his profile and started sharing the selfies + group pics and then I think a week after latam fans shared it, it started popping up on discord and onto twitter. 

His friend that I stalked barely spoke english and only uses chinese apps so there's no way that discord person is any of his friends and it's why I had to ask him in chn. Just saying a lot of people say stuff for attention.</p>

      <p>tbh does that really debunk anything tho? the discord user could've been a chinese speaker who was close to his friends and shared the pics from their socials. i have the boys planet discord server they're talking about and did searching bc u can see messages from users who have left servers (i'm nosy as fuck, sorry anon) and they mentioned being in shanghai with him in one of the pics they deleted (they also could've been lying but like yeah, idk if anything's actually debunked SO it is suspicious but not debunked. u should just take it all with a huge grain of salt, especially bc all the actual information was deleted from the server due to privacy lmao)</p>

      <p>Did she actually mention anything specific or an anecdote? Did she actually delete a comment or is that just assumption? Cause it looks like everything is still there minus pics</p>

      <p>For the most part everything is there but the pics she may have deleted some? but she talked about how she knew and their mutual friends more she mentioned helping him with homework when he sent her pics his hair colors the last time they talked being summer 2020 and how they spoke in mandarin to each other I think she would've kept going if she didn't get lectured half way through which I get but I didn't even scroll too far in everyones long ass dns and pfps were confusing me

      <p>hmmmm after reading the discord msgs and that anon who stalked his old friends I think its the latter 

-Her discord msgs started appearing later in jan and anon found it early jan same time pr vid was up and went viral

-If she was the first one to share the group pics and blurred ppls faces except rickys why are there unblurred group pics? 

-All the pics are deleted on discord so we won't know for sure if those were the same selfies/ group pics but she did mention grey hair and anon mentioned grey hair selfie with a bag of skittles in the bg but said that was on his priv xhs with his chinese exchange student friends and none of his classmates followed him there and the only way you can find it back then is when lat am fans leaked it which matches timeline of when she was on discord

-What she's saying is too extreme tbh. going from he's quiet, introvert, helped him with homework, knew his mutual to HE SENT ME FIT PICS AT MIDNIGHT. Like?????? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€

I dunno seems like its true she was a classmate and she did help him with homework but at the same time hella exaggerated stuff because she had access to pics or ppl didnt find yet. But prob nothing more imo especially anything personal about ricky cause the way she talks about him esp at the beginning she sounded distant like classmate vibes.</p>
