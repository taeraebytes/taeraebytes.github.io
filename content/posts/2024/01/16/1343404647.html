      <p>as someone who was on that train sis I can't tell you it snowballed really fast it's so very easy to hate someone in a survival show setting so you know we all got too lit and just started going crazy it's not even his visuals everyone used to think he was cute before the articles came out it's just that he got the short end of the stick and people decided to expose him and shit was up

      <p>It's also cause in a survival setting you're gonna be mad that someone is pushed over your fav esp since Matthew isn't like incredible and he was SO strongly pushed and in ridiculous ways like why was he one of the shining boys over jinxin mjx ricky or Hao like this is silly</p>
