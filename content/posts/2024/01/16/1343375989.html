      <p>If we are being real here gunwook is the most favorable by wakeone on zb1 hahaha the amount of exposure he got and breakdance, unit schedule, tiktoks and etc. And because you’re a fan of gunwook you won’t let this topic on your CC. I’m waiting for allins and rosins to attack gunwook since he’s the real dayeon of their group</p>
