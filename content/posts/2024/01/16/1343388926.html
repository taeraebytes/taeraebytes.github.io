      <p>If we are being real here gunwook is the most favorable by wakeone on zb1 hahaha the amount of exposure he got and breakdance, unit schedule, tiktoks and etc. And because youâ€™re a fan of gunwook you wonâ€™t let this topic on your CC. Iâ€™m waiting for allins and rosins to attack gunwook since heâ€™s the real dayeon of their group</p>
