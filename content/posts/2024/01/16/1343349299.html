      <p>Btw, around the time when the first episode of boys planet aired on the discord someone started sending pics of Ricky that we've never seen and this person claimed that they used to be really close with Ricky then they started asking people on the discord if they wanted to know Ricky sexuality and everyone was weirded out so the mods kicked them out</p>

      <p>Anon who confessed their sins for being nosey here and I'm here to debunk this because I heard of this. That picture was first uploaded onto weibo by the his old friend that I stalked, around the same time when I found his friends profile 3 other chinese fans found his profile as well and wanted to see pics of Ricky so he shared I think 3 of Ricky's old selfies and then like 1 week later latam fans found his profile and started sharing the selfies + group pics and then I think a week after latam fans shared it, it started popping up on discord and onto twitter. 

His friend that I stalked barely spoke english and only uses chinese apps so there's no way that discord person is any of his friends and it's why I had to ask him in chn. Just saying a lot of people say stuff for attention.</p>

      <p>tbh does that really debunk anything tho? the discord user could've been a chinese speaker who was close to his friends and shared the pics from their socials. i have the boys planet discord server they're talking about and did searching bc u can see messages from users who have left servers (i'm nosy as fuck, sorry anon) and they mentioned being in shanghai with him in one of the pics they deleted (they also could've been lying but like yeah, idk if anything's actually debunked SO it is suspicious but not debunked. u should just take it all with a huge grain of salt, especially bc all the actual information was deleted from the server due to privacy lmao)</p>
