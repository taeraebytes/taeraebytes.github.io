      <p>Ok so let's start w Gunwook astrology reading, pt 1;

Sun in cap; the sun represents your basic traits, who we are at our core
Cap children are the mini adults despite their age and baby face
Cap dominant people don't show their feelings easily they usually keep a lot inside and have carried big responsabilities since they were kids thus they're very practical
They're known to be attracted to status symbols (big cars, rich partners etc), They can be funny, they usually have a sarcastic or deadpan humor
They're usually ambitious but realistic  

Conjunction sun-moon; strong and intense,knows what he wants
Direct and makes decisions easily
Comfortable w himself but can be really sensitive
Really focused and ambitious, always willing to take the lead
Can be stubborn, and act on instinct without thinking

Square sun-Jupiter ;  wants to feel important and praised, wants too much too fast, lack of patience 
Generous, gives more than receives
Nonjudgmental but very opiniated
Prone to excess, probably switches between strong optimism and pessimism  which can mislead him
Wise and intelligent, the advisor friend 
Might have a complex relationship w his father

Opposition sun-Saturn ; reserved, you will only know what he will let you know
Again , complications w the father figure or authority figures in general 
Work first play later 
Have a hard time accepting and loving themselves 
Sincere and honest, very observant 
Hard time opening up 


Moon in cap; moon represents emotions 
Very emotionally stable on the outside and might seem cold, down to earth
Might prioritize his career in life 
Needs to feel useful and productive 
Hard on himself probably has high expectations for himself and others

Square moon Jupiter; again, prone to excess (can be overly impulsive and self indulgent)
Laid back when it comes to emotions 
He might make promises he can't keep not because he's lying but bcs he has periods of huge optimism and confidence and then if he falls can be very discouraged
Can be easily taken advantage of 

Opposite moon Lilith; represses his emotions, feels restricted by them
Often feels guilty when he stands up for himself 
His mother might be conservative and he doesn't really agree w her thoughts? the opposite is also possible I guess
He will always have to chose bw 2 extremes (wife vs mom, him vs family etc for ex) , he needs balance


Mercury is Sagittarius; mercury is about social life and communication
humourous, great conversionalist (knowledgeable and philosophical )
Again, optimism, fast forward thinking, creative, looks at the bigger things in life
Can be seen as tactless and rude because he's very direct and straight forward
Good natured and enthusiastic

Conjunction mercury venus ; Charming communicators and very diplomatic
Great poets, great w words, mixture of feelings and reason 
Atractive voice 
They need a lot of communication in their relationships, they're very rational in love</p>
