      <p>Just a reminder that not too long ago the election happened and we got to see what a lot of idols political views were and them for who they truly are and everytime I think abt it I always question  the ppl I stan  I will never get when certain guy from svt popped up in all Red the day of the voting 😬. But if you’re curious how each area leads politically and where most idols would stand I’ll write this up for u. Basically, Jeolla (Gwangju) and Jeju are the leftist (relative to korean standards) strongholds.
Famous idols from that region: Suzy, Hara (Gwangju), Taeyeon,Sejeong, Hwasa, Sunmi (North Jeolla), Jung Chaeyeon (South Jeolla) Joy, Soyou (Jeju) North (Daegu) and South (Busan and Ulsan) Gyeongsang are the conservative strongholds.Famous idols from that region: Irene, Suga, Nancy, Bona (Daegu), Yura (Ulsan), Arin,Sulli (Busan) Other areas are more swingy. Seoul and Incheon are swingy but Gangnam and Seocho are the most conservative areas  while Gwanak is the most liberal. Gangnam is the rich disttrict so a lot of famous idols are from there: Jennie, Chaewon, Naeun, Hani. Gwanak otoh only has Minju. (Ansan), Suburbs of Seoul are also swingy. The inner ones are more liberal and the outer ones conservative. Idols from inner suburbs include Seolhyun (Bucheon), Jihyo (Guri), Dahyun (Seongnam) Jisoo (Gunpo), Karina (Suwon), Haerin (Anyang), Yuri (Goyang). Not many idols from outer suburbs, I only got Hyeri (who's from Gwangju, not to be confused with the city of the (same name down South) But then there are some massive outliers among those idols especially in Busan and Gangnam. Also gotta remember Korea has a gender gap that's like Sweden. Also kinda crazy that the idol synonymous with Korean beauty standards is from the ultra leftist city. Additional note: although Gwanak is in the south of Seoul the regions there and close to the river are more conservative. Gwanak is in the south but it votes like inner suburbs already but the most liberal areas are in the north of the city. Basically poorer areas = left and richer areas = right.
If you’re curious abt zb1 members in this case  Apgujeong where gyuvin is from is a very conservative leaning area. Chungcheongnam-do (Where hanbin and Taerae are from) also known as South Chungcheong, is a province of South Korea in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula.it borders the provinces of Gyeonggi, North Chungcheong, and North jeolla, as well as the metropolitan cities of Sejeong and daejeong. It’s also had the second highest percentage of conservatives 😬(not really surprising tho) Now Wonju, where Jiwoong is from is highly military leaning due to the history with the Korean War circa 1950-1953 they have very controversial beliefs and the area is very conservative.</p>
