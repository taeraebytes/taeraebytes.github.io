      <p>Can i say something?  Zeroses will never truly be ot9 (they can like the members) but they won’t ever go out of their way to support them individually. That’s ok too but I just find it funny! Even today with the ost release, one scroll down any non hao biased zerose you would not see much about it.</p>

      <p>Not even just zeroses that's how everyone is but people like to delude themselves into thinking it's achievable like liking the whole group and having a clear favorite is as good as it gets
