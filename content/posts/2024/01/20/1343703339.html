      <p>Can i say something?  Zeroses will never truly be ot9 (they can like the members) but they won‚Äôt ever go out of their way to support them individually. That‚Äôs ok too but I just find it funny! Even today with the ost release, one scroll down any non hao biased zerose you would not see much about it.</p>
