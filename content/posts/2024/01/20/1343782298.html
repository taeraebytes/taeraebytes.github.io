according to the op of this post, the 2 walking in front are matt and gyuvin, and a bit later behind them in the group of 4 is gunwook hanbin hao taerae aka the 2nd floor roommates

i think we can conclude that jiwoong def lives alone? ricky just seems kinda introverted or prefers going out alone, yujin is a kid he probably sleeping at home</p>
