      <p>he volunteered to go to switch, it was a scheme by him and park hanbin. phb wanted the killing part but he was lower in rank so it was less likely heâ€™d get it in en grade so he decided to move to switch (thatâ€™s why he secretly learned the switch choreo). taerae had the same issue bc seungeon was also in smn and subvocal 1 is significant more important than subvocal 2 and in back door he somehow didnâ€™t get main vocal despite being more skilled so it makes sense he wouldnâ€™t get the part he wanted in smn. also if taerae was in switch, phb would be more likely to get the killing part bc taerae would vote for him and phb in turn would help taerae learn the choreo faster since i doubt anyone was going to help him in smn and heâ€™s the worst dancer by far. plus taerae knew he had already learned switch so itâ€™s pretty obvious they talked abt it before hand. they were also the only 2 ppl to voluntarily switch teams everyone else got kicked out</p>
