      <p>Sometimes I wonder how many of hanbin's fans genuinely support him and how many of them are just success stans 

Like rosins are loud but they're also super supportive of hao but I don't get that vibe from allins much?</p>

      <p>what's dangerous is also that most of hanbin's kfans are gf stans meaning the second he interacts with a woman in a way his kfans don't like it's kinda over..........</p>

      <p>eh idk hanbin fans are not like that at all, when the fancon happened and he had all his friends there with more than half of them being female they didn't complain, the ones complaining were ot9 fans. if anything they are praying he's not gay</p>

      <p>Idk how it is now but back during the fancon it was the opposite on the kside casual fans non fans all clocked Hanbin as gays while kallins were super mad that he only invented girls, but it's a cumulation of a lot of things cause they were mad at the fancon in general Yujin probably got the most heat tho</p>
