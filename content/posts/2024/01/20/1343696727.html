      <p>you should check pannchoas post about the trucks haos akgaes sent. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ they are getting detroyed in the comments of the korean sites version. yes it is known to be from hao akgaes since theres a ss going around of three people talking about these trucks back on 15th january. the idea of putting sohee and jaehyuns name was kinda last minute according to those screenshots ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>douban again? I was saying earlier it seems like dc gall trolling but who knows whatever it is the point of the truck was to stir shit and even akgaes want to be taken a little serious this was just ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but I don't think anyone really knows who sent it
