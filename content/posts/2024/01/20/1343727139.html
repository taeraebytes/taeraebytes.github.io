    "question": "not sure about eyes because he has uneven eyelids I think if he got his eyes done they'd look the same but he has one double eyelid and a hooded/single eyelid, as for nose I'm not sure? he has a really like small button nose I feel like if he got one of those popular idol nose jobs it'd be bigger? but ofc nose bridges and stuff can also be done who knows",
    "reply": "his eyes are tricky and yea ur right they would be closer together in shape i rlly believe in the cut corners tho they just look so much more open and sharper. and for his nose his bridge is already high and he has a really unique button nose so he didnt do anything to it but an alarplasty, which is just bringing the nostrils in closer it does look a little smaller than it used to but thats it hes only ever gotten like 1 or 2 small procedures"
