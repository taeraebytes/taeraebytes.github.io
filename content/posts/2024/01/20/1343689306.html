      <p>random tea that is useless bc nothing's going on: can't say names bc Gay but one time i was just lurking on tumblr and came across an anon sharing on this blog that their boyfriend had matched with a 4th gen male idol on tinder shortly after his debut but before the group blew up and i saw it and was like "wow interesting i wonder who that is but understandable that he's not named" and then i scrolled a bit more and there was another ask that was literally like "ummm i was the one who sent the ask about my boyfriend matching with [REDACTED] from [REDACTED] can you please delete" which i just found so ??????? bc like the anon didn't even originally name the idol in the ask so they literally outed him which they were.... against? and then the blog kept both of these up? anyways i wouldn't be surprised if anon was telling the truth bc this wasn't like one of those international fans claiming they have sasaeng tea blogs where ppl submit bs it was submitted to a korean lesbian that sometimes talked about the lgbt korean scene. tumblr just feels like such an unmoderated place now bc no one uses it i'm sure there's gotta be more rumours there</p>
