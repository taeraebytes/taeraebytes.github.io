      <p>Gunwooks chart isn't bad he's all cap and sag so even if you find caps to be boring he brings out the fun and light heartedness w all the sag placements he's very serious, has very high standards for himself, is competitive, usually optimistic but can fall pretty intensely, is probably attracted to foreigners or foreign places or anyone a little exotic in his eyes, he is well rounded, popular, likes public life, very lighthearted and probably avoids conflicts 

Probably faced a lot of challenges in his life esp in the first half of life, he might feel like he doesn't get what he deserves comlared to others and might feel unlucky at times
He probably tries to control his environment, and sometimess others

He wants to be seen as accomplished successful and important but doesn't realize he's his own worst enemy he wants it all but fears success he takes failures and minor setbacks to heart and may even practically beat himself up over them

This is just the beginning of what I read lol I can go on if you're interested</p>
