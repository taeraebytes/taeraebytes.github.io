      <p>genuinely never understood people who are obsessed with br icl the people behind it are far-right, misogynist and homophobic ilbe-using  incels that manipulate the charts based on where an idol is from regardless of how popular they are. for example, idols from gwangju dont rank at all no matter how much they're talked about bc the owners hated how the people of gwangju had a democratic uprising in korea. so its pretty much rigged.</p>
