      <p>i fear that if those crosins continue sending trucks or do other things, it could blowback on hao. in case the media gets a sniff of whats happening or they put it on the news or something. if that were to happen koreans and korean kpop fans would hate hao for no reason and his rep would be tarnished.</p>
