      <p>actually the produce format is much better its like an improved ver of bp there were way more fun corners even filler eps were very fun, but i have to say for the male series boys planet has the second best group of trainees of korean survival show, firet is pds1 but bp trainees were very funny and talented</p>

      <p>true about trainees carrying the show bc gp999 was similar, aside from that cell system and k/c/j groups, but i hardly remember any of the trainees that didn't make it to kep1er while i feel like i know almost all the bp ones and even if i don't and they're the ones that got out first round with 0 fans i recognise the names ðŸ˜­ maybe it's also bc i wasn't as into gp999 but i definitely don't remember it being as fun and when ex-gp999 trainees come on my tl every 6 months i'm convinced that someone put kpop trainee prompts through an AI and then shat it out</p>
