Gemini's are the worst type of whores bc they are the type to have shorts situationships and give mixed signals, and they change opinions quickly like they could love you one day and next day ghost you.

Sagittarius are just not real.

Capricorns are not only haters but also they are way too honest, if they dislike you... You will know.</p>
