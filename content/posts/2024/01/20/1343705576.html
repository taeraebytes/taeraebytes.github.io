      <p>itâ€™s so manufactured ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ hao has a bunch of batshit insane fans but heâ€™s an absolute nugu outside of them. rosins need to get serious and realize he is not as famous and huge as they think he is. same goes for allins (and like zb1 as a whole but most zeroses know zb1 isnâ€™t that big itâ€™s mainly rosins and allins who have deluded themselves)</p>
