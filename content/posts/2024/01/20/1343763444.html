      <p>i think when it comes to being the least biased overall itâ€™s taerae jiwoong gyuvin, though gyuvin gets talked about a lot not many people actually bias him, then there are members like matt whoâ€™s popular in the west and jp but in kr/cn heâ€™s probably bottom 2, opposite for yujin, hao is probably at least top 2-3 everywhere, hanbin top 4, gunwook is like in the middle, ricky has been gaining fans and heâ€™s also fine everywhere</p>
