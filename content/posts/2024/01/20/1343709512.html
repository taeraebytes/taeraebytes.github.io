      <p>Hard to say cause he lost a lot of weight but it looks like he did his eyes and nose to me maybe jawline but then again weight lost and I'm no specialist</p>

      <p>he got his nose completely redone it used to b very flat and wide but it looks very natural i doubt it’s an implant. also some filler ofc literally everyone has it and also the eyes duh. every idol has done at least 2 procedures to their eyes to make them bigger or pop out. whether it’s double eyelid surgery, lateral canthoplasty, inner corner cut (epicanthoplasty), blepharoplasty, eye fat repositioning, etc. omg especially the 2 canthoplasties every single idol gets them done and most also do double eyelids and fat repositioning</p>
