      <p>not anon but i feel like you need to give it up and realize that riize are bigger than zb1. br is a stupid metric and doesnâ€™t determine success and i dotn get the obsession w it nor do i care whoâ€™s higher. but zb1 nor any member is bigger than riize/its members nor are they even on the same level. maybe they were back in august/september but not anymore</p>

      <p>omg you've lost it if you're gonna tell me zb1s top 3 is below riizes bottom 3 you're smoking dick im sorry yea riize is bigger than zb1 but you guys actually drag it so hard like riize is doing great let's clap for them but acting like they're revolutionary is insane and I see how you anons talk in lotus' cc do you guys not get tired it's insane how you can't uplift riize without putting zb1 down I think you lot need to calm down the difference is not nearly as disproportionate as you want it to be
