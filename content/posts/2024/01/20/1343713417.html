      <p>Itâ€™s kinda unfair the disproportionate overall popularity ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™d be pissed if I was some members</p>

      <p>I think the only unfortunate members are taerae and gyuvin every member has at least a county or a few where they're 1 or 2 so it's really not disproportionate it's typical for kpop even in korea the popularity isn't as disproportional as people make it seem

      <p>taerae only cares abt singing and pubg or whatever heâ€™s playing so heâ€™ll be fine and if i were guivin i would rather have no fans than only trolls who dunk on me 24/7 and shippers</p>

      <p>That's true but you still gotta be popular the amt of crazy voices in the industry that haven't seen the light in the industry is crazy

      <p>talented members are a special case though it really only needs one lucky moment like chen being the least popular member in exo yet going viral for his osts, solo debut etc. bc the general public tuned in I could see this for taerae (man in love actually did go viral among non fans multiple times as did his introduction video where he played the guitar) his talent will speak for itself in the future</p>

      <p>I think he'll do well as a solo tbh and he's cuter than Chen so there's that
