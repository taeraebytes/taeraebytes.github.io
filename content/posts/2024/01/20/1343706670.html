      <p>genuinely never understood people who are obsessed with br icl the people behind it are far-right, misogynist and homophobic ilbe-using  incels that manipulate the charts based on where an idol is from regardless of how popular they are. for example, idols from gwangju dont rank at all no matter how much they're talked about bc the owners hated how the people of gwangju had a democratic uprising in korea. so its pretty much rigged.</p>

      <p>like sk doesn‚Äôt gaf about 4th gen so there is no it boy there by default, in 5th gen rn riize look the most promising, but they are still way to far from that type of recognition, for hanbin though yeah he‚Äôs the most known out of zb1 in sk but that doesn‚Äôt mean much when nobody gaf about the group outside of the fandom</p>

      <p>tbz are 4th gen kings there ahhhhhh and they're visual trio is easily more regarded than any zb1 and riize members even with riizes company and payola well maybe except Anton with his dad but it's not like they see him as anything else but an extension. and the thing is I need u guys to understand when you refer to the gp you're really only talking ab the general kpop fans ( still a large chunk of sk) but actual gp recognition only gives grace to only certain members of even the top and highest groups not even the full group and their actual full musical catalogs üò≠üò≠üò≠
