      <p>Hao pt 2


Sq moon venus; strong need for approval and affection and thus can get into relationship too fast Can confuse sex and love, confuses what he want and need
He might compromise his emotions to find n keep love, his priorities are distorted
Probably had a loving mother who couldn't understand him
Again, sensual maybe even lustful, loves shopping and food , can work hard but has a lazy streak, sweet and gracious but can be capricious
Very devoted in his relationship, he is attractive n charming 

Sq moon Neptune ; inner turmoil 
Again, very strong intuition 
Daydreamer, loves a sob story, reality checks can be brutal, Creative n artistic, sleeps a lot 
Warm n dreamy vibe, loves to help
Struggles to see things clearly for what they are

Trn moon Lilith; comfortable in his sexuality
This aspect favors romantic and sexual relationships, giving charm, intrigue, and intelligence
He is magnetic and alluring 


Mercury in cancer; super empathetic, almost parental, kind 
Crazy good memory, esp about things that hold emotional value
Self protective, his deepest feelings stay hidden
Great at comforting others, thoughtful, touching, and tactful
Very emotionally driven, might rely on his feelings and intuition for decisions
He's a great listener n advisor 
Might take things super personally, defensive over himself n his loved ones 
I'm p sure matt also has this placement 

Opposition mercury Lilith; he can struggle to make actual connections, can be detached n isolated 
Very creative, unconventional, stubborn and intuitive


Venus in Leo; when he's in love hes super proud and boastful
He needs supportive and positive feedback and attention, he needs to feel very special
Loves showering his so w love and praise n hyping n brag about them but they need that energy to be returned 
Looves the it power couple vibe, is the happiest when in love
Super passionate in love and sex and open to experiment as long as they're not humiliated
Warm hearted, affectionate, joyous, passionate, possessive, jealous and loyal
Can be gullible to love bombing</p>
