Sextile Mercury Uranus: Ingenious, he mixes intelligence and originality 
He probably likes literature, especially fiction 
Very spontaneous in his friendships and knows how to turn situations around positively


Venus in Capricorn: Venus is about love and beauty
wants to take the responsibility and control in his relationships
Doesn't mind being alone so he can wait for a very long time for a serious relationship 
Very ambitious and wants an ambitious partner
Hates ignorance and people that donâ€™t have self control 
Can be an ass sometimes and has a dry humor, very sensitive underneath tho 
Takes relationships very seriously romantic or otherwise, he plans ahead in love and show off quietly unlike Leo Venuses for ex (in zb1, Hao ) but he does want to impress

Sextile Venus Uranus; Funny and unique lover, you will never get bored w him, will always have surprises for you
Values independence in relationships
Talented in arts, esp photography

Conjunction venus pluto : very intense relationships
Likely to have stalkers or be stalkers
Can kinda get obsessed w his lovers and his lovers might obsess over him too and come back often
This aspects make people much more fiery and intense in love (Beyonce has this aspect )
Super giving in love but might hate his lover when he's done lol


Mars in Sagittarius ; mars is about anger and sex
loves debating (as long as he wins)
Genuine and honest
Very goal oriented and enthusiastic 
Funny and playful

      <p>I've actually already done Hao and started doing Hanbin and Ricky but just Hao's is even longer than gunwook so if someone here has a rosin or haobin cc or rs so I can share it and not bother anyone djhekl
I might do Gunwook synastry w the members tomorrow fun fact my friend actually asked me to check out woonghao once for the lols and it was disastrous</p>
