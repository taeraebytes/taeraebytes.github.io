      <p>My thing with Lisa is like yes sheâ€™s a grown woman and can do whatever she wants but to see her hanging out at charity events with all that French president and his community + sick billionaires is such a throw off to me ðŸ˜­. Good thing it wonâ€™t last because we all know them white ppl wonâ€™t allow their song to marry a Asian women</p>

      <p>Sheâ€™s trying to suck up now and is getting deals in return but it wonâ€™t work for long, she got with the younger son who has the least amount of power out of his brothers the two older ones are already married and the only reason his parents are allowing it is because he got no bitches and they want him to be happy + Lisa has some sort of power ig but marriage will never be acceptable especially in their society itâ€™s a BAD look for a family as powerful as them</p>
