      <p>Ok so here gw synastry w zb1 again this is VERY QUICK AND SURFACE LVL also I also quickly looked at composite for his closest friends (Matthew Gyuvin and Yujin)-synastry is the potential of the rs while composite is the actual dynamic ALSO negative aspects are needed for any strong relationship so keep that in mind

Jiwoong; overall, a positive relationship, they like to speak w eo n understand eo well, pleasant rs they're rarely frustrated by eo, Jiwoong can act a bit parental to Gunwook 
On the flip side they can encourage eo's bad habits or one can feel smothered by the other

Hao; they're very different so they might struggle to understand eo n misunderstand eo a lot or struggle to find things in common in general, they both need to be independent for the rs to work, w freedom they can help eo achieve their ambitions 

Hanbin; they're both stubborn n love debates so they might bicker a lot, they have very diff perspectives on things so they need to think things individually cause they might argue when they try to solve things together
Hanbin might try to change Gunwook a lot which he might not like, this rs will probably change gw in some level tho
They have similar tastes n interests, they both need to prioritize happiness for it to work

Matt; they go well together, understand eo n complete eo well, they change n improve eo w this rs, w time they can get into lots of conflicts tho, lots of emotional ups n downs I think this rs even if it gets negative will endure tho cause they really understand eo
Dynamic:closed off at first but become honest n open w eo very loyal to one another, they hold eo accountable n are able to dissect their feelings, they're cheeky n playful together, good friendship although it can be superficial 
You will be able to tell if they fall out like it will be noticeable lmao
They need to work on not criticizing eo n see eye to eye while also not sweeping things under the rug for the rs to work cause it can go south easily n it will mark them both

Taerae; stable n quiet rs, biggest issue is that one dominates the other (prob Gunwook) and the other one dislikes it, chill rs if they're not super close n are independent, can be difficult if not (inconsistent, turbulent rs w lots of misunderstandings)</p>

      <p>ouuuu ok let me get into it 

ok yea i expected them to have smth like that they seem like they wouldnt have anything that makes them clash

yea theyre so different to me i kinda like that about them how much they contrast theyre really cute to me i think they have a nice rs

hanbin and gunwook always say theyre similar to each other which i see in a way? and i see that their relationship might change him 

matthew and him are so cuuuute to me they really do fit each other like a glove and they really do seem more emotional to me like each others rocks. and the superficial thing yea lol that little extra media push but theyre still lit to me. 

ouuuuu idk it seems like taerae wants to get closer but yea i dont see them ever being buddy buddy like that
