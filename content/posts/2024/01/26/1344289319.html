      <p>I donâ€™t see Ricky going solo but I do see all of them leaving yuehua minus hao and Yujin. Yujin because he will only be 18 at disbandment and I think they will want to build up a whole new group around him and hao because yuehua will not let him go unless someone is going to pay millions to buy out his contract and I canâ€™t see any big enough company willing to pay that much for someone who will be 26/27 when most groups from bigger companies have age ranges of 18 and under</p>

      <p>I've been saying he should go for more independent labels and listen to great western albums for inspo since he wants to compose, the idol industry imo is too stifling for him and being a solo Chinese singer in Korea is just not viable and china doesn't have a proper music industry, he needs more freedom and to not be attached to one country particularly like do a Korean and Chinese ver of his music</p>

      <p>This seems like it's very difficult to achieve and he's have to be in an independent label that's competent and believes in his dream for this
