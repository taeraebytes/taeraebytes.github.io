      <p>fun fact but phanbin x taerae has more ao3 fics than junrae lol mostly because they like actually interact and have known each other since like 2020 also the angst lore after zb1 debut oh people were eating that shit up so much so that there's never been a happy phaerae fic ever</p>

      <p>ok sorry to be crazy but i know the phaerae history bc it's kind of entertaining and yes a lot of this can be interpreted as psychopathic from phanbin's side and taerae missing everyone from his company, not phanbin in particular. in two parts bc cc is bullying me and saying there's an invalid API response

non angsty basis:
-matching ending fairies for here i am
-being seen shopping together the day after the finale 
-just them obviously being buddies

the rest not in order bc idk the order. also half of this is not angsty shippers are dramatic:

before evnne's debut probably:
phanbin having a taerae sticker on his phone case for a few weeks

phanbin wearing a shirt that matches with taerae's after taerae was seen wearing that shirt in the airport 

taerae writing a note to himself when zb1 was doing an activity in which they could write a note to any member: his note said that he has to repay the ones that believe in him and do his friend's share (the work of his friends that didn't debut with him)

phanbin being visibly uncomfortable whenever taerae was mentioned by junghyun

his contact for taerae being "zb1 kim taerae". w/o further info this is either psychopathic or all of his contacts are like this.

when taerae talked about animals he resembled on bbl and mentioned a dog, wolf, and fox (no one is calling this dude a wolf nor a fox this is 100% jeonghyeon's, junghyun's, and phanbin's animals)</p>
