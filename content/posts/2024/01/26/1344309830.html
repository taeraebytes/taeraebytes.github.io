      <p>I honestly feel like both hao and hanbin wont do well as solo artist 1 for hanbin his vocals are not that good to be solo plus I would rather have him focus oh him dance 2 tho i see hao being an amazing solo being a solo in korea as a foreigner is hard 3 the best and the smartest option I see for both of them is debuting as a duo somehow I feel like they would really hit off</p>
