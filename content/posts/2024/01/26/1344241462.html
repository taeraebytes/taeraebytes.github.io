      <p>I checked their composite chart and as I said I'm not good at reading them esp since most sources are about couples and riwook are NOT fucking but damn they're pisces sun moon mercury venus and mc this is a very emotional bond (like there's more water than for 2binz and haobin) where they can really get eo without even talking, especially creatively like very dreamy and artsy like in the synastry reading they might enjoy talking about making artistic projects together and might be a really good team id they commit to it and they might feel protective of the other too, they're also Gemini rising so very lighthearted fun relationship, they prob either talk for 2 min or 3 hours no in between and they might prefer texting or calling rather than talking irl, I think there's a sense of distance though maybe it can be like literal distance as in Ricky will leave for the us or china like a sudden cut off, or an emotional distance they can never cross</p>
