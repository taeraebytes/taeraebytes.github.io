Ricky; they have good intentions towards one another n take pleasure being together n exchanging ideas but they often fail to realize those big ideas, plans, promises etc one of them might wish for closeness while the other is restless n wants to go away (guessing Ricky), closeness vs freedom can be an issue
They need to avoid being too critical of one another for this rs to work

Gyuvin; can be a lasting rs, they're loyal n feel responsible to one another, if Gyuvin wants someone mature to be w Gunwook can be that person, not a monotonous rs at all, fun, they can love to sincerely 
Gunwook might try to change Gyuvin which can cause friction, there will be inevitably division n instability
They need to respect one another's opinions for this rs to work
Dynamic; both can become more independent, authentic, charismatic and original after meeting the other, they find the other very different from them n interesting they love chatting , same as mattwook vv cheeky n playful , they try to be equal n harmonious, the rs might feel a bit one-sided tho

Yujin; very caring n tender, if they get close they can gen love n support one another, they make eo evolve n boost eo confidence n enthusiasm they also share plans n ideas like riwook but are more likely to actually do them, really harmonious and unconditional rs yunjin in particular can be very devoted, they like to speak together n respect eo
On the flip side they can be at odds sometimes one can want to go out while the other wants to stay on n the little things can frustrate them
They can develop differently n thus not have the same interests
Dynamic: comfortable w eo they share a lot of secrets, they're emotionally close and supportive of one another they enjoy talking and sharing things and accomplishments and might even be a bit competitive towards one another 
They might prefer to talk privately than in public and their communication might be very one sided
On the downside they can make friends uncomfortable by arguing n bickering in public</p>

      <p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOO sorry riwook is like wow my heart my soul my life my god duo ricky please ðŸ˜– there was someone else in here that said he has a really conflicting chart so hes probably hard to understand ok anosn everyone lets start praying for them i need them to be up each others asses 

lol yea gyuwook give me this vibe its cute they really do seem like brothers that found each other to me and the one sidedness is probably gunwook ugh he was soooooooo obsessed with gyuvin it was crazy now its finally looking equal and i do hope gunwook changes gyuvin a bit its for the better tbh

yeaaaa i see that yujin and gunwook are always together and actually doing things ok wow this is so cute i love their relationship sooo much. i think they really have a sincere older sibling younger siblings relationship its so cute its the little bro gunwook always wanted
