      <p>I thought they'd fit something like drunk dazed fever or given taken since pre debut too!

This is a bit random but I was listening to kali uchis latest album and I think I really want to hear them with this kind of dreamy pop RnB sound (I recommend igual que un Ã¡ngel btw) they're on the right path but they're two minis were too overproduced imo esp the vocals ik it's a trend overall in kpop but I think they'll benefit a lot from keeping the dreamy pop vibe but with a more raw sound</p>
