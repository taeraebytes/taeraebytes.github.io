      <p>I donâ€™t see Ricky going solo but I do see all of them leaving yuehua minus hao and Yujin. Yujin because he will only be 18 at disbandment and I think they will want to build up a whole new group around him and hao because yuehua will not let him go unless someone is going to pay millions to buy out his contract and I canâ€™t see any big enough company willing to pay that much for someone who will be 26/27 when most groups from bigger companies have age ranges of 18 and under</p>

      <p>Well yuehua aren't going to do nothing for gyuvin and he'll stay only if he has plans of being an idol again which I doubt since he can't stop talking ab being an actor
