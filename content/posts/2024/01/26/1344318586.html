      <p>I thought they'd fit something like drunk dazed fever or given taken since pre debut too!

This is a bit random but I was listening to kali uchis latest album and I think I really want to hear them with this kind of dreamy pop RnB sound (I recommend igual que un ángel btw) they're on the right path but they're two minis were too overproduced imo esp the vocals ik it's a trend overall in kpop but I think they'll benefit a lot from keeping the dreamy pop vibe but with a more raw sound</p>

      <p>Unfortunately theres probably like 4 indebted Korean 50yo men managing everything about the group 😭😭I think their main producers imsuho is right for them but as I said too overproducer like a hybe album but without the strong concepts</p>

      <p>🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I think imsuho suits them too but it's obvious he doesn't get to produce for what he thinks suits the members too but they're constantly changing and bringin in new staff we'll see we also have that ex jyp a&r staff now too
