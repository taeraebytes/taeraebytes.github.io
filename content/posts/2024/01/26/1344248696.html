      <p>anon in case you are interested - chinese new year is the correct term technically. no one calls it 'lunar new year' except for white people and people who want to escape backlash from crazed sinophobes (no offence to wonyoung i don't fault her for it but still) chinese new year is based off of the è¾²æ›† calendar which directly translates to 'farmer's calendar' it's a lunisolar calendar and has no mention of or relation the moon at all. 

the phrase 'lunar new year' was so white people can juxtapose the east against the west (orientalism) so they can make it seem more exotic and so they could avoid calling a holiday with chinese origin chinese (to make it more palatable.) so when the inevitable cny discourse pops up in a month you know.</p>
