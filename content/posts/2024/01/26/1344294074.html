      <p>"Rosins are really blowing all their money on the mag and ost" tbh the ost im fine with them blowig their money since it mostly benefits haos name when he gets number ones on itunes BUT bulk buying the magazine or albums im really against, all that money doesnt even go into haos pocket ðŸ˜­. yall are making wakeone richer and then complain about the stuff wakeone does bad/fucks up, they are not gonna change if you keep throwing money at them. its like youre saying "why are you handling hao bad... anyways here is some money"</p>

      <p>Yea but this is a bit of a double edged sword fans can't help but want to break records and do things for their fav even if they stop that mass buying it's not going to change or affect anything they'll still treat hao the same way and he won't get paid any different tbh
