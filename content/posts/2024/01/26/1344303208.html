      <p>Rosins are really blowing all their money on the mag and ost ðŸ˜­ I'm concerned for my moots because this is definitely over consumption which is honestly okay to get the foot in the door but it's really more important that we work on avenues for exposure so that we don't need the fandom to hard carry so much, thing is I think a lot of rosins tend to be adults or college students and are more willing to blow some money on albums or votings or magazines than spend time on yt or tiktok promotion</p>
