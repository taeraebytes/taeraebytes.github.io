      <p>I think they have a sense of belonging(?) with each other being the only ethnic foreigners in the group it naturally will give them a bond but they're not close to each other Ricky isn't even one of haos favorite younger members

      <p>they don’t strike me as close in a ‘bestfriend’ way, more of ‘we adore and respect each other so much close’ does that make sense? if i had to rank who is the closest to hao in the group gyuvin would come second i mean he did sleep at his house before the finale , idk i used to think that they aren’t that close as well but i’ve come to appreciate them so much lately</p>
