      <p>i donâ€™t dislike yujinâ€™s voice or anything but 90% of the time when heâ€™s singing to me it sounds like his nose is stuffed</p>

      <p>i like his tone but when I listen too closely you can hear the nasalness and it's breathy but he improved from yits to melpo

      <p>He is already better than Sakura so if he puts in the effort he can be passable, I don't think he will tho he doesn't seem to enjoy being an idol much lol</p>
