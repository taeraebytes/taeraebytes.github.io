      <p>gyuvin was pushed tho but we dont talk bout it because it made no noise and we forgot but wakeone did push gyuvin during crush, i think they tried to save him from losing more kfans and hope he gains new ones. He got that gig with taerae and that pink rat, gyuvin yujin matthew and gunwook mukbang thing, the car accident show, baby cloud again and the one with hanbin and bnd guys.</p>

      <p>I mean the nobody paying attention part is definitely true cuz I forgot all this he lowkey was getting gigs in crush but I wouldn't say push just cuz we ain't rlly see him much performance wise but that's rlly just chalked up to his lack of skill. They are definitely trying to salvage his image tho
