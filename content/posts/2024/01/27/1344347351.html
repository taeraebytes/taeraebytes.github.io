      <p>there’s no real reason to kick him out. nothing he did was illegal or immoral (he was smoking outside + was of legal age and him and his gf were both minors when they dated). the hiatus was most likely to let things blow over + take legal action. at the end of the day, most ppl in korea dc abt the situation it’s like using reddit or stantwt to generalize how every person in america feels abt something. gag and talk saxy are still charting well and they’re ot7 and seunghan always gets 2-3rd most lines bc they rely on gp domestically. their intl fandom is massive compared to their kfandom and the ifans are super vocal abt bringing seunghan back so it would only hurt the group if they kicked him out. either way, ppl will tune in in korea but they risk losing global support if he doesn’t come back, and that’s their target audience</p>

      <p>it's illegal to smoke as a minor in japan so there's that😭 but korea is a very conservative society you needa understand this is basically illegal adjacent for a celeb. The only thing his hiatus has done was grow the fandom they call him a fandom wall and they've hit daebak since he left from a marketing standpoint there's no reason to add him back and one thing ab sm they could give a lesser fuck about ifans like theres been no real backlash from them aside from some riize is 7 posts and one truck the only thing that would save him is the huge I fandom but that just depends if sm cares ab that or not
