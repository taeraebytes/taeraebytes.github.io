      <p>Also this I feel like they're better but in bloom era I would tweak so bad because you could just tell THEY DO NOT CLOCK IN TO THAT PRACTICE ROOM award show season is the best they've done now they're back to hanging out everyday oh my goodnesssss😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I've only seen like 3 members talk about being in the practice room props to taerae tho cuz I've seen him talk about it he's serious ab improvement but we got someone like gyuvin trynna kick it in the streets of Seoul every night

      <p>the only one I see verbally expressing is hao no? hes always talking about getting off work on time, how it annoys him if he doesnt get off on time and it kinda irked me when he said it during zb1tv when he was like if I die (during mafia) does it mean I can go home earlier? Other than that I wouldnt say they're lazy if you watch their bbls they usually go live at around midnight and at wakeones office so they practice late af</p>
