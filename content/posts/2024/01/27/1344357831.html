      <p>mnet loooves haobin. invited them for the asmr thing and everything i am sure that if wakeone would allow it mnet would make a new show just for the two of them, they probably also knocked on wakeones door for mixnmax(?) but w1 declined. mnet is not as stupid as w1 to see that hao and bin as a duo brings in alot of views and probably also money if they were to market them. wakeone is trying to sell mattparkz when yaoi fans would be down for gunwook and ricky but yall are not ready for that convo yet</p>
