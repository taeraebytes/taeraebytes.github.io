      <p>Ok from what I've gathered it's this hanbin fan who's notorious for screaming at him it's basically a troll acc using obscure pictures trying to claim they're gunwook and that he got kicked out the group this person makes a little explanation but the whole this is ridiculous and it's blown out of proportion and I just gotta pray that big dumb bitch passes away tonight
