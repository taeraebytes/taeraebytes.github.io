      <p>Ok from what I've gathered it's this hanbin fan who's notorious for screaming at him it's basically a troll acc using obscure pictures trying to claim they're gunwook and that he got kicked out the group this person makes a little explanation but the whole this is ridiculous and it's blown out of proportion and I just gotta pray that big dumb bitch passes away tonight

      <p>I translated the thread none of it makes sense but there's just the proof of the bad ig photoshopping and the "leaked paris video" that's just a video of the sparking Eiffel Tower one of the biggest tourist attractions
