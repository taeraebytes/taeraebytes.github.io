      <p>obviously mattparkz are close with each other the same goes for haobin but you cant tell me there isnt a difference on how they handle both duos. cause both of those duos love and respect each other and probably spend alot of time together off cam too. so i dont get why w1 is letting one be how they are but is limiting the other one. i still want ricky and gunwook to do something together tho. matthews cute and all but blonde hair ricky and black haired gunwook is where its at.</p>
