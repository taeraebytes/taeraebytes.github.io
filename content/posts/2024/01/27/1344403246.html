      <p>I’m surprised rosins or allins haven’t taken down that little cult circle down yet because they say a lot of invasive things about them and post a lot of personal things</p>

      <p>i've heard that in one of those hanbin or hao protection telegrams they try take them down but they keep coming back. i guess they don't talk about it publicly bc otherwise it draws more attention to it, like how the hao rumour post-finale only really had info about it on a google doc that was meant for those who wanted to report it to wakeone/yuehua and wasn't really talked about on twitter</p>
