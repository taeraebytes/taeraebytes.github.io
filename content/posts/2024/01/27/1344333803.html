      <p>we complain about the companyâ€™s incompetency which is a huge thing but the members attitude and lack of sincerity towards improving will also play a huge part in their downfall</p>

      <p>am I the only one that feels like all of them except for jiwoong is really trying. Hao hanbin gunwook and matthew are self explanatory so I'll explain for the other four because I really do believe theyre trying their best too and haven't dropped the bp drive

taerae - writing, doing covers and is trying to improve his dancing by staying late in the practice room + helping members with their vocals too
ricky - we don't see much because he doesn't talk about himself but from what we do see in zepisodes/ fancams is hes always dancing/ practicing in the background while everyone is usually standing around before the stage. Also a lot of people don't mention it but a part of being an idol is being presentable so the fact that he goes the extra mile is already a sign he's serious. 
gyuvin - he knows hes lacking a lot and he often says he stays late and practices one on one with hanbin. The fact that he's self aware he's lacking is a good sign.
yujin - He just has poor stage presence ðŸ˜­ I feel like we just see poor stage presence and equate it to not trying/ lack of interest but it will get better with time once he gain some confidence and identity minus the tongue sticking out.

All 8 has vastly improved since in bloom and their styles are starting to blend with one another + u can see their bonds building. I know I sound like a Jiwoong hater, trust me I'm not. I'm a few ot9 that lurks this cc but whether it's his dancing or bts stuff you can tell he's kinda alienated from the rest.</p>
