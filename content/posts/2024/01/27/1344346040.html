      <p>can wakeone hire a vocal coach specifically for yujin and ricky? idc slave them away, lock them in a studio and make them fckin do breathing lessons and sing for hours. 

Their vocal tones are so distinct and unique in kpop AND its pleasant to the ears, i know some idols have a unique vocal tones but sounds so fcking bad iykwim. They have so much potential with the proper technique and its such a fcking waste to not utilize it. imo our songs aren't really distinguishably from other groups because no hate, most of our main vocalist have generic vocal tones but those two specifically can help with distinguishing us from other groups, like give us some sort of identity. Not even their bias but I have to admit their tones are prettiest not just amongst our group. I feel like both just lack technique so yujin can sound nasally and ricky can sound breath-y. jeballlllllllll wakeone</p>
