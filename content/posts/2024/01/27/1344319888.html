      <p>i mean its pretty obvious that if hao sold 150k magazine books it would be around one million dollars, the same thing is with zb1 album sales. wakeone still likes to act like they are broke tho</p>

      <p>well the costs would go to the album factory production the producers the mv set etc and kpop companies aren't the best at paying their artists
