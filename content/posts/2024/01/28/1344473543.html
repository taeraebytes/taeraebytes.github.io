      <p>i get that but sheâ€™s also insanely rich and well known without this i dont understand why sheâ€™s decided to spend all her time in france playing puppet to these higher ups, im guessing its the connections sheâ€™s making from her lmvh ceo boyfriend i personally think she can do better as an individual</p>

      <p>she wants to secure that bag frfr but it's gonna backfire on her because i don't think she realizes that she has become a player in a more dangerous game than in a rich celebrity world. these elite families and politicians are NASTYYY. and her bf will probably start cheating on her the moment they get married, if he hasn't already. but I feel like she will put up with in as long as he will provide her with the status and money because clearly that's her goal here. frederick wouldn't have seriously dated lisa if she wasn't willing to give birth to a heir. what surprises me tho is that this elite white family is ok with mixing their family gene pool with lisa's ethnicity, or maybe they'll use a sugorate.. who knows. but still choosing to enter the world of one the richest families in the world (that did so many atrocities in order to get that point), instead of freely sitting in her luxury apartment with her millions of dollars is insane to me. she's greedy asf</p>

      <p>Oh yup that's what I was thinking either that or she isn't allowed to marry him besides her self made fortune as a kpop idol which within korea is looked down upon compared to actors and chaebols even comedians have better status than idols generally I don't think they'll get married I think after she gets as high as she can and also when she probably hits 30 they're gonna break up but it's an evil game she's playing
