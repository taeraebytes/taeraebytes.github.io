      <p>yeah korean men kinda put japanese girls on a pedestal kinda a fetish also stereotypes where korean women are likely to be feminist which men there hate, but still koreans are nationalistic to the core so hookups are more likely than actual longterm dating</p>

      <p>on the topic of being nationalistic i recently saw graphs displaying how in general for current  younger generation women lean politically towards left and men towards right and the korean one seemed to be one of the most disturbing to me, kr women were on average moderate left and men were suuuper far right, and they used to be almost in the center in 2015 but there was a very quick and drastic change</p>

      <p>This was a good read thank you the overwhelming shift to the right for young men does make sense with the growing voice of women in the country. And yea I do think location can play a part a country this small has different types of influences compared to first world heterogeneous countries like america for example
