      <p>Ok from what I've gathered it's this hanbin fan who's notorious for screaming at him it's basically a troll acc using obscure pictures trying to claim they're gunwook and that he got kicked out the group this person makes a little explanation but the whole this is ridiculous and it's blown out of proportion and I just gotta pray that big dumb bitch passes away tonight

      <p>is this actually a big issue? because when nugu groups get caught like this it gets thousands of rts but i feel like there's barely any noise about it and the account that start this mess went private and start acting like a troll doing spaces and editing pics</p>

      <p>Well it was pretty unbelievable that's why and usually when the nugus get exposed it's cuz it's real but this was obviously snuffed out immediately by zeroses I'm glad it's over this made me suicidal

      <p>gunwook needs to be besties with ricky ASAP. I feel like Ricky's fam got ties in the states and they ballin so they can prob do what wonyoung did by going through the us court to get bosongs korean anon ass identity outed cause twitter is american and has their own privacy law that korea can't touch, then sue in k court.

idc if bosonge is the one photoshopping this shit or not, theyre the ones spreading it and this is obv malcious and they prob kno it was fake af and prob wont stop. this btch is gonna gets wats coming the way they keep targeting gunwook like how sojang kept targeting wonyoung</p>
