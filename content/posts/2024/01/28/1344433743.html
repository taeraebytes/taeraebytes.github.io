      <p>They are defending him but they're being sarcastic they're asking "Gunwook caught around playing with it?" And they follow up with "gunwooks hindsight is perfect let's reveal the bastardization" my translation engine gave something more rough but this is what it gave. UGH I NEED TO LEARN KOREAN ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
