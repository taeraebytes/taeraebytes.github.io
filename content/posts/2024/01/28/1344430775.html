      <p>that live wasn't crazy at all. why are suddenly rewriting history?  it was meant to be 3 person live but since gyuvin's and gunwok's fat faces were taking up the entire screen ricky had to sit into back, so he started his own live in the same room for fans to see him. it lasted not more than 5 minutes and all he did was greet the fans, and then he got cursed at by the manager and banned from the app for 1 month. can u tell what was so crazy about it? please I would like to hear</p>
