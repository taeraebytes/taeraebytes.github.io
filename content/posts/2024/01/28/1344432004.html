      <p>okay so Idrc about the text msg screenshots because those look fake af but where do you think the selfie came from, the one that looks like its in his hotel room. Do you think that's photoshop/ deep fake? It looks awfully real ngl T_T</p>

      <p>It does look real there's honestly no explanation and since I can't understand Korean or Japanese I'm confused. The ig convo screenshots meant to "look like" gunwooks burner have two different kinds of default profile pictures and the audio from the Eiffel Tower video has been explained as smth else. I'm sorry this is still so confusing but there's no explanation to the picture people think his iCloud's been compromised or staff sold the picture along with the contact info as proof of it being legit
