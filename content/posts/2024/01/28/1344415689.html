      <p>you can tell when gunwooks dating but he hasn't and he doesn't rlly give to me but I don't think hao is dating either I think the only people that are are jiwoong and yujin and it's not surprising with the whole rookie thing there isn't time and frankly their tea is clocked instantly they're not smart at hiding stuff but I think yujin might've broken up with his gf
