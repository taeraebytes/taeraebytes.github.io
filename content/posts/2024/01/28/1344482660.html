      <p>Why do you think only Hao is getting those mentions from the kpop cline and not Ricky? Idk I feel like both of them should already be in the group</p>

      <p>kpop cline are all his age and Ricky's just quieter also the gc is dead that's why they didn't really add hao then he got added later chenle and renjun(?) are the only ones that are actively friends w hao anyways

      <p>he mentioned that he’s friends with a lot of cline and multiple idols mentioned him too, also ricky doesn’t seem to like to go outside of him comfort zone to make new friends so why would they mention him if they don’t even know eo, it’s not like you automatically become friends with people of your nationality</p>
