      <p>Sweet tooth sigh just wow, showing up to award shows drunk? So unprofessional I canâ€™t imagine how fucked his vision was when he did that little dance break omg. No wonder the members look bothered itâ€™s rude on his behalf especially to the them, staff and choreographers who work hard and especially the younger ones staying up all night rehearsing while your up getting lit with your gf and her circle.. yk when I said I wanted him to put the casamigos down I had hope but noâ€¦ imagine how FOB from LA who risked his childhood to train, left his loving mother and art career  to achieve his dream and spent years training  in a new country just for some amateur bl actor to come and hog all the fashion and mc gigs, get his own variety show have 0 talent and not even live in the dorms, show up to rehearsals or bother to form a relationship with u? BOYYY I would be heated if I was FOB from LA</p>
