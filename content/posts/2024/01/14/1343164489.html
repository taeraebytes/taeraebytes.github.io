      <p>this one acc who is a known hao anti on weibo brought up stuff from douban to “prove” that it was crosins who did those stuff on ig and allindans on twitter are eating it up rn. douban is an anonymous forum usually full of gossips so ofc if we go by their logic of proving things this way, the teas about hanbin on douban are true too. one of the threads about him and his manager that has been going around which i think everyone even kzeroses know by now:

      <p>well the ig comments are def there but this anti just wanted to stir shit up even more between allins and rosins and mistranslate shit benefitting from the fact not many people on intl twt speak the language and she knew alr how bad c-rosins reputation is on this app but some rosins are clocking her bullshit... and many people are pointing out what's happening is due to even k-zeroses being frustrated it's literally not just rosins like sure they're involved too ofc but why do these people refuse to believe kfans can actually criticize wk1 when they fuck up? im not talking abt the hate comments directly towards him obv those are just your regular haters, but i've seen so many comments simply asking wk1 to be fair and stop mistreating other members and ofc allins would rather off themselves than admit these complaints are reasonable have sense in them lmfao. And if you ask me they should be on w1's ass rn to stop setting him up if they really want it to stop because you can't tell me posting a solo focus for ONE member out of 9 is something normal, it isn't that big of a deal for sure but it's not like it's the only instance and people should open their eyes.</p>

      <p>I'm seeing a lot of things getting debunked but I agree like a concern is not fucking crazy 😭😭😭 but idk ab the focus I never saw it and it was an ig story. but saying there's a clear difference between members especially when there's CLEAR mistreatment like it's not crazy sis but hey
