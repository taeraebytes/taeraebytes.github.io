      <p>Foxy brown said several times that they had no relation and was uncomfortable with the rumors
He's still a weirdo though, they say he dated bey at 21 but he already met her at 15/16 and they were already together often at 18 (nothing we can do about it obviously they've been married for a while but there's a lot of interesting stuffs about their early relationship for ex beys uncle used to say it wasn't real in the early days and that bey didn't like him) he was also close friends w r Kelly and the other creep producer that groomed Aaliyah and so were a lot of men in the industry, I think they should be all investigated</p>
