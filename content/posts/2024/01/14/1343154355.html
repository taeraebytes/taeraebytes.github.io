      <p>she doesn't work with CJ either, that's studio gl1de director and idk if she even has that much time to be managing both studio gl1de and also be zb1 manager since studio gl1de was casting trainees is it even confirmed that she's the head manager?</p>

      <p>people are saying she's the female manager from all their videos but again this is all alleged. And everyone's been saying she's a head manager so idk I checked her ig and she seems to be posting about a lot of their schedules and keeps up with hanbin and it doesn't look like she manages anyone else but yea

      <p>Most groups usually have more than one manager it's hard for a single person to be managing several people at once</p>

      <p>they have more than 3 bc i also think that there's other managers who are also from wakeone + that other female manager that was with them at london. i know that txt for example had like 3 managers and they are 5 members so maybe those many managers are common</p>

      <p>Yeah bigger the group the more number of managers they have esp if they have an active solo career as well

If you know Jang Sunkyu's show (Workman) he did an episode where he worked as Exo's manager for a day and they explain how it works
