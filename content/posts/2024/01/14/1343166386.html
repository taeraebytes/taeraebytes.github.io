      <p>I don't think his company is affiliated but it seems like the manager is deeply connected her resume is crazy she was in YG Jellyfish she was a manager for hyuna, guanlin and another actor I recognized. I rmbr someone mentioned this a few days ago and thinking wow we need her she's experienced but I didn't know it was like this ðŸ˜¯
