      <p>she doesn't work with CJ either, that's studio gl1de director and idk if she even has that much time to be managing both studio gl1de and also be zb1 manager since studio gl1de was casting trainees is it even confirmed that she's the head manager?</p>

      <p>people are saying she's the female manager from all their videos but again this is all alleged. And everyone's been saying she's a head manager so idk I checked her ig and she seems to be posting about a lot of their schedules and keeps up with hanbin and it doesn't look like she manages anyone else but yea
