      <p>The massive hate that heâ€™s receiving is all organised by the crosins rn why would we want Hanbin to go to China and get called names there. Even in the fansign some crazy crosins were asking Hao not to pose with Hanbin now imagine him in a place with 80% crosins yeah sorry we donâ€™t want that</p>
