      <p>streets are saying this woman was involved in selecting hb for the bp auditions, she's owned by CJ and she's participating in the offline auditions to select participants in iland2 (wk1+CJ) and she follows the official account so it's true.. and her now being zb1's head manager and his own personal manager is just weird asfk lol idk</p>

      <p>but how is she owned by CJ and also his personal manager when CJ doesn't have shares on the l1ve or studio glide. i do know that hanbin studio gl1de manager probably has a lot of connections bc of her time working in cube bc cube is kinda involved with CJ so maybe it was a friend of a friend recommendation type of thing. I also always found interesting how both Zhanghao and Hanbin casually had their "close friends" on the show too but ü§ê</p>

      <p>I don't think she's owned probably connections and she's def not a personal manager either just the head of managers ALLEGEDLY people are pointing out this "favoritism" so there's that but close friends? Do you mean matthrw and kuanjui?
