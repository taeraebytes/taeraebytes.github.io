      <p>Even if it's true rosins are just trying to also make it sound weird bc it's not even that she's obsessed with him, she's just his manager so of course she will be pay more attention to him. It's like saying that Yuehua manager it's obsessed with Zhang Hao bc he's with him everywhere, when we all know that he's with him all the time bc he knows mandarin and it's from Yuehua, and for some reason he despises Ricky.</p>
