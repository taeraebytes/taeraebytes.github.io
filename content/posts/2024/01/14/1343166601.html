  at these award show credits they aired out their managers names and it confirmed to people which ones were involved in the Ricky thing and there’s no female manager there.
But also say hypothetically she did work in zb1 as hanbin’s manager like the yuehua ones does, is it shocking that she would look at for him the most, because ideally that’s what fans were hoping the yuehua manager would do for the yuehuaz but unfortunately yh are actually so incompetent as are their managers.</p>
