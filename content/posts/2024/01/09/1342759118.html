      <p>rosins would be shitting themselves and crying if they saw any zeroses or subfandom using a twibbon unrelated to hao on his birthday let's be honest. it isn't that deep but it's kpop and people will find any reason to be upset so don't pretend there wouldn't be a damn hashtag about respecting hao if the situation was reversed</p>

      <p>but izoneâ€™s contract extension was bc they had that rigging scandal which made them go dead silent for months. i feel like ppl forgot about that but i followed wizones at that they and they were in the trenches with a delayed comeback and a trailer that was scrapped. wanna one had an extension but that was due to being neck and neck as top bg in korea with bts BUT at the same time kep1er are in talks for that and theyâ€™re not nearly as successful so anything could happen. however, bc of yuehua iâ€™m leaning towards no since all the kep1er companies are Interesting while all of zb1â€™s are the same minus yuehua taking up half the group and having strong plans for post-group</p>

      <p>Oh I thought they just got one cuz of fan demand oh damn no extension then. Kepler is getting one becuase their companies would genuinely get negative profit

      <p>idk what everyone is talking about ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ starship refused the izone extension they lasted exactly 2.5 years down to the last day and the w1 extension was because (exactly like zb1) they were going to disband during awards season and they got one month extra to wrap it up and say their goodbye properly no more no less (so this might happen to zb1 too). if they have a discussion about extending further yuehua will obviously say no.</p>

      <p>Ugh to think Ive could've been izone logical continuation if they kept the love dive concept not every group needs those concept changes to show their diversity esp when you don't even sing live so you're just a Kpop dance cover group (sorry I'm a salty wizone)</p>
