      <p>idk if this was their first airport appearance but i was soo confused when the whole tl was tuning into that like i know we were bored and all but why were people excited for their first mobbing ðŸ˜­ i guess people didn't expect this this fandom must have a lot of new people</p>

      <p>It was their second or third everyone watched all their mobs live cuz we all wanted to watch their first airport experiences it was insane. And we had no idea they'd get mobbed after the first time we assumed they'd get good security and it's just that it was exciting seeing the lineup together and as a group
