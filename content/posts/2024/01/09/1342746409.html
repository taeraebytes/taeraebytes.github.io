      <p>Theres this one video of Ricky staring at New jeans members , and its so endearing even as a shipper i believe he just cant help staring at people whilst other idols have huge tendency to not look anyone in the eyes for too long,, when any idol laughs or claps he stares at them directly but i dont think its ship worthy</p>

      <p>K I didn't wanna ruin the fun cuz that video is so funny with the bg music and slow mo and saw u guys talking bout it yesterday here with the funniest takes but if u watched the video he looked cuz the mc where mentioning new jeans ðŸ˜­ the mcs were making ppl guess who the next award is and then they also hinted at bnd who sat in front of newjeans so it looked like he was looking at them again. It's so funny how some cropped slow mo with love bg music can do</p>
