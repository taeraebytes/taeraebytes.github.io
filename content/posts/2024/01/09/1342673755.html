      <p>hes their best singer

sohee
seunghan
WALLL
WALLLLLL with barbwires
WALLLLLLLLLLLL with barbwires + electric fence
wonbin
the rest 

thats why when they wanted to kick seunghan a lot of ot7 were like NOOOOOOOO we gonna have no singers left and our number 1 singer rep is just as bad as seunghans so he might get kicked too. So when they did eventually kick seunghan a lot of now rice are changing their mindset with sohee by calling him cute and adorable and shit, trying to forget his past because if sohee gets kicked too group is for reals doomed.</p>

the hunting bar was a regular bar when he & his friends visited to celebrate themselves turning 20 his huge problem that group picture with someone covered in tattoos but really no one knows the relationship between the two or even if the tattoo guy is actually bad & his bullying allegations were also rumors 
So it boils down they just decided to bully him because of his looks</p>
