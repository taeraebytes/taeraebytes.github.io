      <p>rosins would be shitting themselves and crying if they saw any zeroses or subfandom using a twibbon unrelated to hao on his birthday let's be honest. it isn't that deep but it's kpop and people will find any reason to be upset so don't pretend there wouldn't be a damn hashtag about respecting hao if the situation was reversed</p>

      <p>No offence but that was against nugus and is not a proper award whereas the other one being presented tomorrow was against big fandoms and trot singers.</p>
