      <p>heâ€™s their best vocalist in a group thatâ€™s otherwise pretty average on that front, especially for an sm group, and a strong dancer too. not sure about variety since i donâ€™t follow riize like that but yeah</p>

      <p>see this anon proved my point about the cutie patootie mindset XDDDD (I'm the anon that answered y he's important with the singing rank with the wall and barbwires) It's crazy how the human brain works, if enough people agree to something people will follow even if you know its not true.</p>
