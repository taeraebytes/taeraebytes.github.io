      <p>probably bc jiwoong has nothing else to add to the group, like gyuvin is a dozen but a funny one and jiwoong isâ€¦ old and boring so ig they want us to pretend that he is a visual at least</p>

      <p>I think he was meant to be the main visual but yujin is getting cuter and his visuals are preferred
