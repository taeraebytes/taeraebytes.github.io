Ever since last comeback i think where they started to change their concept and each member had different styling knets hated it saying things like when did these pure girls turn ratchet. And ever since minjis noodle scandal and her talking back knets were like and they have nasty attitudes ughhhh. And rn rice feels like debut new jeans.\n\nso now i wonder if newjeans will go back to debut concept which knets like or continue pushing the members individually within the group with styling and personality. But debut concept is getting boring, rice is doing it too and yea no feeling it",

      <p>Not to compare cause one is obviously much smaller than the other two but when I look at newjeans and Riize I think they all strongly blend with each other and lack individuality it's like the song makes them rather than they make the song like if they all got replaced by another set of pretty faces it wouldn't change much compared to say, 127 or gidle, is that what Koreans like? I used to think the same about I've but I think wonyoung Yujin and rei have strong charisma now</p>
