      <p>I'm seriously not even trying to be slick idw be mean but idols do not write their profiles it's always staff and the companies that lie on their behalf it's less common for female idols but the ones that are rlly short get their heights bumped up it's just an age old thing. I was talking about this for zb1 not long ago half of them are lying too

      <p>ok but wonbin was also towering over renjun in the tiktok they did tgt and while i know renjun is short he’s not below 170 and if u try to say insoles renjun probably got them too. idk why y are so adamant on trying to think they’re short as hell 174 and 176 are not even tall</p>

      <p>RENJUN IS TINY AF think ab it like this is you're actually 170 why would u tell the truth it's what men do universally anyways you'd bump up ur height a few cms cuz u can get away with it with shoes and if other guys are lying you blend in. And yea he's (renjun) below 170 matthews official height is 170 and I guarantee you he's below 170. im not adamant it's just the truth 176 is avg for male idols anyways wonbin got dragged for having his official height as 176 because it's just obvious he's not. I'm pretty tall myself (174) and I saw both groups live it was so glaringly obvious who was lying
