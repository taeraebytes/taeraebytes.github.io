      <p>donâ€™t say that iâ€™m going to cry. all biases aside, heâ€™s a victim in the whole situation and he didnâ€™t deserve any of it. yeah he did some stupid shit but that person ruined his life and the career he spent years working towards. and riize is literally on the road to becoming the next big thing they are already lowkey digimons in korea (this isnâ€™t even an exaggeration i was looking at charts and it is actually insane, better than u might think) he deserves to be up there with them</p>
