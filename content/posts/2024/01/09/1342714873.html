      <p>She s/h and always guilt trips her parents for money. Every time she's in seoul she mentions the infamous Han river. I know cause she posts about it on her weibo, but deletes it soon after.

She even tried to guilt trip him to do something he is clearly uncomfortable doing not once but twice. Like whatever she's got going on I get it but she's projecting it onto ricky idt that's right.</p>
