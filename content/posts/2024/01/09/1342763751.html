      <p>rosins would be shitting themselves and crying if they saw any zeroses or subfandom using a twibbon unrelated to hao on his birthday let's be honest. it isn't that deep but it's kpop and people will find any reason to be upset so don't pretend there wouldn't be a damn hashtag about respecting hao if the situation was reversed</p>

      <p>I'm seriously not even trying to be slick idw be mean but idols do not write their profiles it's always staff and the companies that lie on their behalf it's less common for female idols but the ones that are rlly short get their heights bumped up it's just an age old thing. I was talking about this for zb1 not long ago half of them are lying too

      <p>RENJUN IS TINY AF think ab it like this is you're actually 170 why would u tell the truth it's what men do universally anyways you'd bump up ur height a few cms cuz u can get away with it with shoes and if other guys are lying you blend in. And yea he's (renjun) below 170 matthews official height is 170 and I guarantee you he's below 170. im not adamant it's just the truth 176 is avg for male idols anyways wonbin got dragged for having his official height as 176 because it's just obvious he's not. I'm pretty tall myself (174) and I saw both groups live it was so glaringly obvious who was lying
