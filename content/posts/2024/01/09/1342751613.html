      <p>there are multiple people who only stan certain members for achievements and it's obvious when they go batshit crazy over any other member getting anything. i am sorta glad my bias is one of the less popular ones so i can enjoy things most of the time and not pull my hair out over some title or "achievement" no one but my subfandom gives a shit about. how do they expect to go 2 more years when they're already this worked up</p>
