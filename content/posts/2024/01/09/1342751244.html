this is hilarious they're never beating the most bitter sf allegations.. especially when you remember how they attacked their fanbase over doing no projects for hb and they literally did the same when his ost came out like ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­</p>

      <p>there are multiple people who only stan certain members for achievements and it's obvious when they go batshit crazy over any other member getting anything. i am sorta glad my bias is one of the less popular ones so i can enjoy things most of the time and not pull my hair out over some title or "achievement" no one but my subfandom gives a shit about. how do they expect to go 2 more years when they're already this worked up</p>
