      <p>Not to compare cause one is obviously much smaller than the other two but when I look at newjeans and Riize I think they all strongly blend with each other and lack individuality it's like the song makes them rather than they make the song like if they all got replaced by another set of pretty faces it wouldn't change much compared to say, 127 or gidle, is that what Koreans like? I used to think the same about I've but I think wonyoung Yujin and rei have strong charisma now</p>

      <p>For new jeans yea there's no strong identity I thought riize were going to? but I feel like they're kinda muddled now idk
