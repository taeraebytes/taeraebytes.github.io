      <p>Meh wonyoung fans need to just accept that she doesn't want to be friends with no one that it's on the industry and let it go, she's not even friends with idols outside of her group. This is not even a Suzy or Hyuna situation on where they had beef with other members but had friends outside of their group.

Two groups and she didn't make friends in either of them, she doesn't hang out with other idols either, it's clear that it's a decision she made by herself so her fans need to accept things and let it go</p>

      <p>mmmm i dont think so like its always going to look mean if you are actively leaving someone out of a photo. im not the biggest fan but wonyoung cares ab her image why would she purposefully have people think theres discord in her group and idk she seems nice and sweet like someone said shes close with liz so its just weird

      <p>ive has new dorms and they are split in pairs, she's dorming with Liz rn so of course that she at least has to be a little bit close with Liz. 

I don't think she's not friends with them bc she's mean or something, she can be kind and all that but imo she just doesn't want to be friends with people in the industry and that's it, she's just there to collect her cheque and leave.</p>
