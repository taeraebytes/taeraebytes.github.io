    "question": "Despite his goofy carefree loving persona Gyuvin strikes me as a very insecure and sensitive person like he needs to learn to roll with the punches a bit because the majority of the jokes and jabs that get thrown at him from (mostly young) fans are a reflection of his own unseriousness. Like they're just picking up on his energy and imitating it to emulate closeness with him which I'm sure gets annoying but frankly it's way too early to be getting snippy with them over it. He needs to offer up something else to impress or attract fans beyond his goofy personality proportions and yaoi bait because no one's entitled to be taken seriously, you have to prove it with your skills, improvement, commitment, etc. I like him but i dont want his public growing pains to come at the detriment of his own future or that of the group's.",

      <p>i don't even think he needs to lose weight but gyuvin is so obvious after fans said he did now he's talking about it all the time trying to get sympathy like bitch? don't talk about how you ate fucking 8 ice creams then if you want me to feel bad for you? but actually i never will feel bad he gives rich kid who grew up never having to know shit about the world and gets mad when you tell him to learn. also he has ruined his image among kfans because whenever he gets dragged i see so many qrts talking about how he's stupid and it's too real. he said on live that pizza was a french food and when i saw people laughing i just sighed because all he's doing is reinforcing their thoughts like he is truly making it worse for himself. i just can't believe all the shit he gets away with, any other member and they'd be getting dragged but all his fans do is fucking baby and coddle him and make it worse</p>

      <p>Jrnrngjtnkckdjfnjfnf omg yea gyuvins just a dumb boy a huge chunk of his fandom is trolls now and I always get surprised when he frequently reads out their hateish comments like always today he read out the piggy gyuvin comment idky he does that lowkey.. but I'm ngl you can tell he talks about certain things to get a reaction but he's just that type of person to say all that he's def interesting...ðŸ˜­
