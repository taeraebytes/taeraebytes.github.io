      <p>idk there’s like this weird mix of male idols bulking up but also wanting to be skinny like girl u gotta pick one. also i feel like some female idols have been getting skinnier and skinnier and i think it all started with wonyoung’s rise (absolutely not blaming her but companies and the gp) like just yesterday there was that sakura and sana tiktok and sana’s appearance just made me sad</p>

      <p>female idols are so scarily skinny now i’m genuinely afraid that something REALLY BAD is gonna happen to one of them before the idol industry realizes this is unsustainable</p>

      <p>there's been many instances where things get too alarming but as always nothing changes I forget which group this girl was from but her bulimia was so bad that she was getting consistent throat infections to the point she left the group because her health was so damaged

      <p>Yea she's the only person ik of that left due to an Ed yea she was getting sick cuz of her bulimia I watched a video on it. but almost everyone has an Ed in the industry and it's pretty severe everyone's had a moment in their careers where they were alarmingly skinny especially female idols. It's just that hers in particular got to a point that was damaging her health at an exponential rate.
