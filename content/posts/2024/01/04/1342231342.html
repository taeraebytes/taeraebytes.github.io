      <p>Kpop stan will riot if they see this but MAMA is the best award show this year so far, ccma is the only contender i fear, less made up awards and the winner based on real achievements and of course not attendance awards</p>

      <p>Hmmmm I guess but ccma made a category so riize could win a roty tho 😭 but I think so too mama was one of the best mma a close second cuz that was also sm fraudulence like people don't wanna give mama their flowers but they had some of the best performances and we have yet to see better

      <p>hanbin KR fans need to start the omg hanbin is so tall payola, look at how he's taller than sohee and munjae so kfans are like wait he's not even the tallest one on his group... and then they are like omg zb1 is such a tall group, and then their fame gets bigger.</p>
