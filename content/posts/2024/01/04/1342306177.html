      <p>if it was ditto they wouldâ€™ve been dragged for copying so at least theyâ€™re trying to be original . but also ppl who have alr heard the song r saying itâ€™s vocal heavy so itâ€™s hard to tell how it will sound from just that clip. kinda like how the crush teaser was just noise and it only turned out to be half the chorus</p>

      <p>Yea I'm ngl this sounds like majority of the chorus but even that's fine it'll probably be vocal heavy in the other parts
