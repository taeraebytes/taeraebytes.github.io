      <p>Meh wonyoung fans need to just accept that she doesn't want to be friends with no one that it's on the industry and let it go, she's not even friends with idols outside of her group. This is not even a Suzy or Hyuna situation on where they had beef with other members but had friends outside of their group.

Two groups and she didn't make friends in either of them, she doesn't hang out with other idols either, it's clear that it's a decision she made by herself so her fans need to accept things and let it go</p>

      <p>mmmm i dont think so like its always going to look mean if you are actively leaving someone out of a photo. im not the biggest fan but wonyoung cares ab her image why would she purposefully have people think theres discord in her group and idk she seems nice and sweet like someone said shes close with liz so its just weird

      <p>its not actively leaving out, im a wonyoung fan and dive but honestly shes barely in behind the scene content, even for ot6 content like its rare. she takes private life to a whole other level and members usually never have anacdotes about her whilst rei will say what yujin had for dinner last night. she is really close to gaeul, and friends with liz but everything else is just total business. the saddest thing to see as her fan though is her growing apart from yujin its really rare to see a sincere interaction between them anymore and theyre just two distant people now. to sum this up i dont think she cares to do things with the group that isnt for content. and thats ok tbh doesnt mean she hates them but the business relationship does give me miniscule miss a vibes.</p>
