This is not even a Suzy or Hyuna situation on where they had beef with other members but had friends outside of their group.\n\nTwo groups and she didn't make friends in either of them, she doesn't hang out with other idols either, it's clear that it's a decision she made by herself so her fans need to accept things and let it go",
    "reply": "mmmm i dont think so like its always going to look mean if you are actively leaving someone out of a photo. im not the biggest fan but wonyoung cares ab her image why would she purposefully have people think theres discord in her group and idk she seems nice and sweet like someone said shes close with liz so its just weird"

Two groups and she didn't make friends in either of them, she doesn't hang out with other idols either, it's clear that it's a decision she made by herself so her fans need to accept things and let it go</p>
