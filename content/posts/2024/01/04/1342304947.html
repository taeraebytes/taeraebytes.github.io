      <p>Zb1 will lose their fandom and hype just like kep1er since there are new boy groups that are debuting and a lot more interesting and younger than them. They fall off badly since riize are getting more popular and having stable fandom</p>

      <p>you talk like they're old or something? Yujins still on the youngest end and besides riize all the other groups have yet to come close to them bnd is the closest and they're not really seen as competitors in any category. And riize don't have a stable fandom why do you think their second release flopped? I'd love for you to have a moment in reality but this is annoying asfk
