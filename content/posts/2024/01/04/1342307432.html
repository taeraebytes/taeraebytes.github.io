      <p>most groups still have like a vocal line and if u make the notes easy enough anyone can sing like itâ€™s pop itâ€™s not a ballad as long as u sound good itâ€™s fine. like ive has 2 singers period and they still manage to sing every chorus. whether it sounds good half the time is debatable but</p>

      <p>That's true but singing live and or carrying it out ðŸ˜… it's just out of trend ig to sing choruses and it's the producers as well
