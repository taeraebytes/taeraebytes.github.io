    "question": "It’s really normal? Im suprised people were shocked at this. I don’t to virgin olive oil I do another seed oil but 10ml is literally less that a spoon full and most people consume more than that in high fat oils daily anyway. There’s a lot of health and digestion benefits to small amounts of healthy oils, e.g cod liver oil, extra virgin olive oil, seed oils. Especially for people who work out a lot because it helps muscle repair",
