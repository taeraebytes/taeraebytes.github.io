Caresha didnâ€™t invite JT to her or her daughters birthday party and JT never hangs out with Caresha like that anymore because apparently whatâ€™s going around is that JT doesnâ€™t like being around Careshaâ€™s new friends especially that girl Momo who sheâ€™s always hanging out with on IG apparently thatâ€™s one of the girls who JT had beef with for years and almost fought. But ppl also forget that JT is still on probation from getting out of jail so itâ€™s kinda hard for her to hang out and do stuff outside of LA yk? + sheâ€™s kinda elevating herself with hanging out in that new little clique of black nepo babies & girl boss brand owners ( i rlly see her becoming a fashion girl instead of doing rap in a couple of years). To me I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any bad blood between them but their kinda growing apart and only their work is keeping them together (which they wonâ€™t have for long because word going around is there label donâ€™t need them anymore especially with this new era of rapðŸ˜¬) which is natural for friends",
    "reply": "Their label dropping them??? Ok fuck this new era of rap I love city girls music so much like I'll shoot myswlf in the head if we get ice spice clones.... but yea this makes sense and I've always loved JT more than Caresha may she prosper. I feel like santana was keeping their work relationship in shape with the constant ig lives with the both of them people really saw them as closer than ever"

      <p>They may be now well I think they can't be coworkers just cuz they started off as very close friends and two girls against the world they're definitely venturing off into their own things especially jt and they just probably grew apart and since they're not promoting tgthr rn they're not as public but coworkers doesn't seem like the right word to me
