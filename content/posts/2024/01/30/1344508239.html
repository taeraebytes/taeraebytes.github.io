      <p>I think that the "big deal" is that he's the uncle that knows hanbin irl and he's even close with hanbin family so it's different to when Ricky sisters like gyubrick post's bc they don't even know gyuvin like that. But I mean we know that he's gay so it's not like he's saying something bad about him</p>
