    "question": "i'm kinda confused so the chats were all debunked? did gunwook actually talk to a sasaeng before deleting his ig acc and then that sasaeng made up other chats and blew things up in anger or what? also what's up with the toilet pic because i believed it was fake right up until i saw the toilet pic.. the official acc's photo didn't hv the toilet but in the one the sasaeng(?) posted there was a toilet? so is it photoshop out of the photo by the official acc (thus making the gw rumors true) or did whoever creaated those rumors photoshop the toilet into that photo",
    "reply": "Basically the sasaeng bought gunwooks info which had his number and ig. She also bought gyuvins info Ricky's info and yujins info, she took her chances and tried to talk to gunwook and got blocked she was going to do this exact same thing to yujin as well. The sasaeng especially liked those two and talked ab seducing them but she got upset and contacted some trolls a few days before the acc dropped on twitter to farm interactions and facilitate outrage. She got caught cuz she was being messy and quite frankly bad with photoshop that her own sasaeng friend ratted her out cuz she got annoyed. The person who delivered to the public exposing the scheming was a troll that was jumping gunwook the day before so she got annoyed too"
