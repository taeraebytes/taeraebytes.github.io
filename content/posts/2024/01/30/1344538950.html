    "question": "Hao’s shoes being blurred in the dance practice was funny by then I realised it’s probably because it’s a brand that is socially boycotted in China. I remember when stanning svt if either jun or minghao wore shoes from Nike/adidas? They would blur their shoes, I understood it more then because they actively promote in China as well as Korea. I thought maybe they just did it because he’s a c idol but they didn’t blur out any of Ricky’s shoes, I wonder if yuehua has made it clear that he’s already got future plans to promote in China and that’s why they blurred them",
    "reply": "Oomf explained it as a precaution for every c idol that's just taken nowadays due to the previous draggings and controversy and it's better for them in the long run if they do promote in china"
