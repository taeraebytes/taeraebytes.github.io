      <p>Allins were mad and threatened as hell to gunwook since the possibility of him being a mc has higher chance now. I'm in this gdm with allins including big accounts and they were cursing and fatshaming gunwook. They were also talking to K allins to expose gunwook to panchoa about him being close to noonas and sasaengs eps that blackgun_0110 acc. I think gunwook will be the next one to be expose just like seunghan of rize.
This might put gunwook on hiatus too.

Look at what i‚Äôve told you guys before about that scandal on gunwook its now trending on pannchoa. Next leakage will be their convo with her fansite. You all didn‚Äôt believe on what i‚Äôve told you before gunwook will be the next seunghan scandal</p>

      <p>The whole thing got debunked on twitter we do not care if he's trending on pann that place is a troll forum (pretty sure it died down on instiz as well and the debunking was enough and they were logical sooo we win) + plus there's been damage control taking place for days it was supposed to to get that high way earlier it's impressive it was stopped but what can you do nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and now everyone's going to sleep and this is is old no one cares anymore. You really tried it MY KING WILL ONLY RISE
