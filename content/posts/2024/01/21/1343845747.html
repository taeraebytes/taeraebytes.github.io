      <p>Hao pt 3
Venus opp Uranus; unconventional in love, he wants both a traditional love story n something new , considering he is queer he might want a trad love story w no gender roles
Loves novelty and excitement, wants a friend in his so, for his rs to stay exciting 

Venus trine Pluto; sexy, seductive, enigmatic 
Wants truly passionate love stories that will change him deeply
Very devoted and passionate, he attracts people who are intense and jealous 
He attracts and is attracted to ppl who seem to have their feelings under control on the outside but give a lot to him and are intense w him in the inside 
Sexy and sensual wo trying and seem freakier than he actually is
Giving lover, gets obsessed w his lover, every relationship changes him


Mars in cancer ; his one flawü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, passive aggressive, self defensive and takes things personally, hates feeling like he is criticized, moody, dramatic, holds grudges 
Fear rejection and might not make a move unless he's sure he's being accepted 
Sex is very much tied to emotions, he might use it as reassurance that he is wanted, there's always some emotions involved in sex for him, sex is deeper than fun for him, sex and love goes hand in hand
He will mother his so a lot, really enjoys caring for ppl, he is very kind and gentle 
Indifference is worse than hate to him
Usually trad monogamous lovers down but might need to sleep around to feel wanted if he's undeveloped and or insecure 
Matthew and Ricky also have this placement 

Sxt mars; determined and energetic , courageous, the type to fight on behalf of someone else, persistent, often becomes the scapegoat, hard working, ambitious , a winer and role model potential, risk taker

This is just my theory but I think he's def a Virgo rising</p>
