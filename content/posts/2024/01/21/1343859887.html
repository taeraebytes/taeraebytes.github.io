it's coming out that some c-allins might (i don't speak chinese so i can't say for sure) might have bought it themselves. i would not put it past them to be honest but if so i need to see some allins humbled. i dislike both sfs but allins irk me more</p>

      <p>wish i could send pics because I have ss and some non-rosin ch speakers confirmed the translation is correct. the most baffling thing was then mentioning the truck before it was sent (so c-allins knew about it beforehand) and then them shitting on jaehyun and sohee saying they stole the center position from hb on emka ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ literally it all adds up</p>

      <p>But this doesn't make sense bc Miyeon was favored by mcountdown pds, now that she left hanbin is the one being favored, he's always at the center when it's the 3 of them and the one who gets the most content out of the 3.</p>
