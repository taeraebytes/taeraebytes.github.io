      <p>Hao pt 2


Sq moon venus; strong need for approval and affection and thus can get into relationship too fast Can confuse sex and love, confuses what he want and need
He might compromise his emotions to find n keep love, his priorities are distorted
Probably had a loving mother who couldn't understand him
Again, sensual maybe even lustful, loves shopping and food , can work hard but has a lazy streak, sweet and gracious but can be capricious
Very devoted in his relationship, he is attractive n charming 

Sq moon Neptune ; inner turmoil 
Again, very strong intuition 
Daydreamer, loves a sob story, reality checks can be brutal, Creative n artistic, sleeps a lot 
Warm n dreamy vibe, loves to help
Struggles to see things clearly for what they are

Trn moon Lilith; comfortable in his sexuality
This aspect favors romantic and sexual relationships, giving charm, intrigue, and intelligence
He is magnetic and alluring 


Mercury in cancer; super empathetic, almost parental, kind 
Crazy good memory, esp about things that hold emotional value

Great at comforting others, thoughtful, touching, and tactful
Very emotionally driven, might rely on his feelings and intuition for decisions
He's a great listener n advisor 
Might take things super personally, defensive over himself n his loved ones 
I'm p sure matt also has this placement 

Opposition mercury Lilith; he can struggle to make actual connections, can be detached n isolated 
Very creative, unconventional, stubborn and intuitive


Venus in Leo; when he's in love hes super proud and boastful
He needs supportive and positive feedback and attention, he needs to feel very special
Loves showering his so w love and praise n hyping n brag about them but they need that energy to be returned 
Looves the it power couple vibe, is the happiest when in love
Super passionate in love and sex and open to experiment as long as they're not humiliated

      <p>It's ok I'm on a break for now and autistic so it's cool at least we're not talking about the rosallin civil War lol

Sun; very emotional and sensitive, empathetic kinda motherly vibe, very loving maybe to an unhealthy degree, in zb1 Taerae is also cancer sun
Moon in Scorpio; I love scorpio placements üòç observant and aware, can be a great manipulator, you never forget things and have a hard time letting go esp w your cancer sun the Aries rising really forcing you to move tf on lol need deep relationship, may fear abandonment so you may struggle to open up, you may struggle w extreme emotions sometimes feel too much sometimes feel numb, you have a mysterious alluring vibe and prob great hair, you can be stubborn and shut ppl out
Mercury in Gemini; Hanbin has this placement, you're a great communicator and story tellers you're smart an can talk ab p much everything, you can exaggerate tho but it's for fun
Venus in Taurus; Hanbin Yujin and lana del rey have this placement, you need stable intimate relationship, you love restaurant n picnic date, you're possessive, you move slow and pay attention to the little details in your crush, love intimacy be it w friends or lovers, slow in flirting and can be elusive in the beginning cause you need time to figure it out

Mars in Sagittarius ; Gunwook and Hanbin have this placement, you probably run away from problems instead of facing them head down, attracted to foreigners foreign places or anything exotic really dk if you're a minor so I won't go in the sexual aspects
Aries rising is so slay you might be lonely and independent, you probably have fire brows and a big forehead lol you probably look intimidating and attractive , you have an RBF and look younger than u are, u have a strong presence, u get angry easily</p>
