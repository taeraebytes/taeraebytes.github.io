      <p>i think about how zerobaseone had so much potential at first, like when they debuted they had so much hype (no other bgs had received that much hype back then, not in a long time), they were a survival show group selected randomly by votes and yet their visual chemistry is crazy it’s so satisfying seeing how similar they are with their simple (?) flower boy visuals, they’re neuro+queer like they’re bound to be entertaining variety kings if they were not so strictly supervised by their company, taerae could’ve been more pushed as like, korea’s new vocal son or whatever (but wakeone refused to give him any payola), ricky’s star potential could’ve been utilised like that’s a baddie for real like omg wakeone deserves fucking nothing. people think that the akgaes were the source of the group’s downfall but tbh their akgaeism was worsened by the company’s imbalance way of promoting them as individuals and as groups tbh</p>
