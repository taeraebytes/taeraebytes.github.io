      <p>I didn't even know there was a live I'm sure there's smth on yt and I didn't film all of it soz but he talked about every members star moment and you can so clearly tell who he liked and disliked off of how he explained and described themüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ him saying yujins star moment was when he was getting bullied by mihawk and didn't say anything else ab him and then the thing ab gyuvin

you guys should watch it for yourself bc it's hilarious but if anons can't play videos rn: 
ricky saying that the pd gathered all of them up during the dual position battle and said he was going to get fired GJHKFGGH and the pd saying he was doomed especially bc of taerae's team bc they were the worst and "had some trainees with no sense of rhythm" im crying this is even worse than i remembered 


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/tofuzhanghao/status/1693492866834923880"></a>

and the pd saying that gyuvin hadn't been a trainee for long so he took the more chill parts during songs even though he's been a trainee for at least 3 years 11 months oh he really hates him that's crazy</p>
