If you look at Ricky as a person he does buy expensive things but he also wears it for a loooong time and re wears things often. He doesn't buy things just because its expensive but buys it because he genuinely likes it. I feel like this alone proves he's not \"new rich\" because new rich would just buy things, wear it once and never see it again.",

according to the op of this post, the 2 walking in front are matt and gyuvin, and a bit later behind them in the group of 4 is gunwook hanbin hao taerae aka the 2nd floor roommates

i think we can conclude that jiwoong def lives alone? ricky just seems kinda introverted or prefers going out alone, yujin is a kid he probably sleeping at home</p>

      <p>I feel like Ricky clearly the richest gyuvin aaaalways pegged me as rlly rich and then gunjin I feel like we're next i thought gunwook was just regular middle class but everything he's worn predebut is extremely expensive like 500+ clothing items on a regular day and I could tell yujin was kinda rich too then Matthew taerae pegged me as upper class maybe a little higher? Idk and hanbin too

      <p>sorry but Ricky will always strike me as a very new rich kid like only one of his parents hit the jackpot unless someone rpoves me otherwise, its very rare an actual mutlimillionaire goes around saying tall and handsome i think gyuvin might actually have inheritance wealth</p>

      <p>gyuvin is less wealthy but his money is older idk Ricky resembles the other veeeery rich Asian intl students he befriended and they're all crazy rich they might have grown in wealth but I do think they had at least 1 rich generation before them

      <p>same I think Ricky's parents are at least 1st gen rich meaning his grandparents prob were the ones who got into whatever business they're in and made money first and then his dad/ mom followed in their footsteps because 
1) they were living in shanghai comfortably and shanghai is expensive af 
2) Ricky's parents were smart and patient with their move to the states. They prepped Ricky years in advance. It wasn't like they suddenly got money and decided to move to the states + his entire family moved, it wasn't them just sending Ricky alone abroad which most rich family do. Like you gotta be rich rich to move the entire family. iirc they first transferred him from a private chinese elem school to a private international elem school in shanghai so that he can experience international students and english so when he did come to the states he won't be completely culture shocked with a completely new culture and language. Which is really smart and considerate of Ricky imo
3)This amount of prepping seems like Ricky's parents already knew what they wanted before even having him and I feel like it's because of his grandparents giving them advice with the economy and even politics. 
4) That young and rich was just a bit for his pr and went viral for it so he kept it but even near the end of bp he said he wanted to distance himself from that phrase. If you look at Ricky as a person he does buy expensive things but he also wears it for a loooong time and re wears things often.

I feel like this alone proves he's not "new rich" because new rich would just buy things, wear it once and never see it again.</p>
