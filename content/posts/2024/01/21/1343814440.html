according to the op of this post, the 2 walking in front are matt and gyuvin, and a bit later behind them in the group of 4 is gunwook hanbin hao taerae aka the 2nd floor roommates

i think we can conclude that jiwoong def lives alone? ricky just seems kinda introverted or prefers going out alone, yujin is a kid he probably sleeping at home</p>

      <p>I feel like Ricky clearly the richest gyuvin aaaalways pegged me as rlly rich and then gunjin I feel like we're next i thought gunwook was just regular middle class but everything he's worn predebut is extremely expensive like 500+ clothing items on a regular day and I could tell yujin was kinda rich too then Matthew taerae pegged me as upper class maybe a little higher? Idk and hanbin too

      <p>I think that's like a decent 150-100k salary or less because the cost of living in korea is a lot lower than what I'm used to but def lead a comfortable life
