      <p>I'm sorry that producer was actually insane he was openly just talking shit and I couldn't stop laughing I forgot to record half of it cuz I just was listening to the train wreck he was funny everyone was mad but it was entertaining nobody said anything till like a few hours after but it's not like he was wrong

      <p>I didn't even know there was a live I'm sure there's smth on yt and I didn't film all of it soz but he talked about every members star moment and you can so clearly tell who he liked and disliked off of how he explained and described themüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ him saying yujins star moment was when he was getting bullied by mihawk and didn't say anything else ab him and then the thing ab gyuvin
