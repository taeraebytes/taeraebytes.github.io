Very ambitious and wants an ambitious partner
Hates ignorance and people that don’t have self control 
Can be an ass sometimes and has a dry humor, very sensitive underneath tho 
Takes relationships very seriously romantic or otherwise, he plans ahead in love and show off quietly unlike Leo Venuses for ex (in zb1, Hao ) but he does want to impress

Sextile Venus Uranus; Funny and unique lover, you will never get bored w him, will always have surprises for you
Values independence in relationships
Talented in arts, esp photography

Conjunction venus pluto : very intense relationships
Likely to have stalkers or be stalkers

      <p>Ok but it's long cuz hes a lot pt 1;
Leo sun; imo a healthy developed Leo will love to hype others up almost as much as he loves to hype himself up
Can sleep and laze around a lot but he's a real hard worker when gets to it, Usually loyal to his loved ones
Honest, frank, competitive, prideful, arrogant, idealist 

Cnj Sun mars: knows who he is and is very upfront about it, aggressively himself, he's brash and bold, maybe even vulgar 
Very competitive but it's positive here
He responds to emergencies and challenges very well cause he reacts fast and is very focused, leader vibes
Has a seductive hard to get vibe, charismatic 
Self absorbed 
In love or sex, he loves the chase
Probably at war w his dad (argues a lot )

Sxt Sun Jupiter; lucky in life or at least he feels like he is very lucky
Good hearted and sees the good things in life even when things are hard People like him
Lighthearted nd overall pretty happy 
Might be attracted to foreign places and foreigners

Sxt sun Saturn: he is respected and has authority 
He's very orderly and does everything in a step by step manners, he dislikes people that disobey the rules
Might have been very immature in the first of his life nd has to suffer the consequences (this made me laugh when I researched this aspect, poor gay teen troll Hao LMAO)
But he is very grounded level headed n responsible now
Can be another daddy issues aspect, his dad might have not approved of him or gave him the love or attention he needed, he feels distant n it might have a lot of effect on him

Sun op Neptune; daydreamer, disconnected, delusional, sees the world through distorted rose colored glasses Kind and creative, a great guide
Can be another daddy issues placement, might feel like his father is physically or emotionally distant
Can have a lot of personas, fake profiles, fake names etc
His daydreaming escapist tendencies means that he might have been or be easily fooled by others esp male figures that he overidealize 
Might idealize the past n his childhood even if it wasn't good, can fall into self destructive habits

Sun trn Pluto : super passionate, he can easily find a passion, drown in it and focus on a goal
A lot more intense than he seems
Can be a great artistic placement 
He is perceptive and loves growth, great leader

Taurus moon : super chill, comfy, kind, homebody, they're known to be big foodies, he loves music and luxury, he is sensual, kinda romantic and magnetic, the definition of Taurus moon to me is Zendaya 
Prob introverted even if social, keeps his private life private 
Very patient n a great listener however he's probably shit at apologizing tho
can be vv materialistic and self absorbed but he is warm and super loyal to his loved ones, he sticks to his loved ones even in very hard situations, break ups don't happen easily 
He loves singing, he also has a Taurus degree in the sun so natural inclination for singing and fame
Also Taurus moon are STUBBORN AS FUCKKK</p>
