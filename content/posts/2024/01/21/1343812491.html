      <p>its crazy cause minhee hyungjun and jungmo all from produce x101 and x1 were loved in korea,  not as much as wanna one but not below zb1, im still shocked they lost that many fans i mean they probably earn enough to make profit and their company has IVE now so no pressure .... Zeroses this is the future block out negativity and enjoy zb1 as much as u can</p>
