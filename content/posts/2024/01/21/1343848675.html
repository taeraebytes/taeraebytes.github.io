      <p>Sometimes I wonder how many of hanbin's fans genuinely support him and how many of them are just success stans 

Like rosins are loud but they're also super supportive of hao but I don't get that vibe from allins much?</p>

      <p>what's dangerous is also that most of hanbin's kfans are gf stans meaning the second he interacts with a woman in a way his kfans don't like it's kinda over..........</p>

      <p>eh idk hanbin fans are not like that at all, when the fancon happened and he had all his friends there with more than half of them being female they didn't complain, the ones complaining were ot9 fans. if anything they are praying he's not gay</p>

      <p>most of the ignore his past because they think he couldve changed his mind or because they think he will not act on his sexuality, and will probably marry one of them ðŸ’€ the ones that buy the most and follow him everywhere are gf stans or people that dont really care about him (following him everywhere and taking the picture ones) most lf crosins will leave him once hes not center so its whatever i guess</p>
