according to the op of this post, the 2 walking in front are matt and gyuvin, and a bit later behind them in the group of 4 is gunwook hanbin hao taerae aka the 2nd floor roommates

i think we can conclude that jiwoong def lives alone? ricky just seems kinda introverted or prefers going out alone, yujin is a kid he probably sleeping at home</p>

      <p>I feel like Ricky clearly the richest gyuvin aaaalways pegged me as rlly rich and then gunjin I feel like we're next i thought gunwook was just regular middle class but everything he's worn predebut is extremely expensive like 500+ clothing items on a regular day and I could tell yujin was kinda rich too then Matthew taerae pegged me as upper class maybe a little higher? Idk and hanbin too

      <p>sorry but Ricky will always strike me as a very new rich kid like only one of his parents hit the jackpot unless someone rpoves me otherwise, its very rare an actual mutlimillionaire goes around saying tall and handsome i think gyuvin might actually have inheritance wealth</p>

      <p>gyuvin is less wealthy but his money is older idk Ricky resembles the other veeeery rich Asian intl students he befriended and they're all crazy rich they might have grown in wealth but I do think they had at least 1 rich generation before them
