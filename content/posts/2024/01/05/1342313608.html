      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>doesnâ€™t it make more sense that hanbinâ€™s guiding gyuvin in the right direction rather than gyuvinâ€™s leeching off of hanbin? that seems more realistic to me.</p>
