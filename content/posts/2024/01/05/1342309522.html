      <p>not anon pulling up a tweet from an akgae that has "zhang hao and the rest" as their bio ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. yall have to learn to seperate akgaes from the actual subfandom. allins in general congratulated hao, akgaes were and always will be the problem. putting eb in one box is not helping our situation as a fandom</p>
