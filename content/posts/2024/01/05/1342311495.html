      <p>Kfans hate Jiwoong for imo valid reasons (ok dating isn't valid but not being skilled, being weird and putting literally no effort into the group is bad enough for me) but intl fans won't care about those things, Gyuvin is more debatable but he's the one who has more reason to be hated on the intl side if people open their eyes and see that he's been actively ignorant a few times already well they might realize in his next or fifth next micro scandal</p>

      <p>i agree like theres reasoning behind the hate and im ngl i dont think rookies should date thats just me tho but people love acting dense like its just blind hate
