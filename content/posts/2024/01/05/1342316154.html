      <p>Yuehua never promoted him even yujin had more people say it's cuz no one knew he was Chinese but.... he looks so ChineseðŸ˜­ and he has an accent in English I could tell almost immediately but that plus no screentime when cfanbases were focusing on the promoted yuehua trainees and shanghaiz. And then Ricky's fandom fought with mjxs and then rosins bullied criyangis to hell and back so that's kind of why. he has 2nd or 3rd biggest Chinese fandom in the group tho but in the beginning all he had was western fans then Koreans started liking him

yeah rickys had a lot of growth since award season started and his trip to china. i remember this user also posted a chart showing how all the other members were losing daily active fans while ricky was the only one gaining but they deleted cuz rosins were on their ass since haos fanbase is the most stable overall obv</p>
