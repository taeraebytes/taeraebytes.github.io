      <p>there has been talks since months ago about how minji tries to act like a "boonie" afaik being a boonie in korean is someone who went abroad to study for a short period of time but when they come back they act like they know nothing about korea, everything started bc of the amount of English she would speak, also bc she said that she didn't know what some korean dish was, and also there's a live on where she's confused about what malatang is, and Danielle is like "malatang... what we ate yesterday" and minji cuts her off and kept saying that she doesn't know what malatang is. And now this happened so a lot of people are saying that she's just playing it up.</p>
