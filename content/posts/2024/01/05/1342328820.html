      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>The same thing applies to Taerae/Gunwook and Rosins akgaes. They only like these two cause they think they are beneath Hao.</p>

      <p>Taerae and Gunwook fans are scared to say something to Rosins, its pretty obvious. There are Rosins that hate on Gunwook or Taerae, but you will not see them on your timeline cause eb is keeping quiet and lets them bully those two</p>

      <p>i personally havent seen bullying maybe on weibo or other platforms its a diff story and im sure they do get bullied but theyre much smaller fandom wise than rosins like theyre not going to provoke like riyangis do and face the brunt of that. but me personally i would but im not on public anymore so

      <p>Rosins don't even bully them like that, you know the main culprits when they are mad on Weibo, maybe they will get Jiwoong or Yujin involved cause they're easy target because of age and Yujin has a large fanbase on Weibo, but Matthew Tr Gw or Gyuvin nah there's no bullying</p>

      <p>They are bullies his c fans are the same people who hacked into hanbin’s supertopic for his new ost and turned it into a zhanghao supertopic, the same ones who bullied Ricky so bad to the point where you couldn’t even scroll through his tag without seeing gore and nasty edits with tens of thousands likes, the same ones who harassed hanbin and sent him death threats even when he made a speech as the leader and bullied him to the point where the video blew up on Weibo and on Twitter and now hanbin doesn’t even make speeches anymore. They bullied yujin, they bullied matthew until his stans apologised and begged for them to leave him alone, they DO bully taerae and call him a singing monkey but because he has no stans nobody cares. The bottom line is they bully anyone, even if they’re not threatened they’re just nasty like that and revel on the power they have.</p>

      <p>They hate on everyone I'm just saying their bullying agendas are reserved to a smaller number of members as a collective they just don't care enough to bully taerae every second like they do with hanbin and Ricky. They definitely bully everyone that's just what I mean. But omlll they're so terrible😭😭😭 AND NOBODY HAS TAERAES BACK😭😭😭😭😭
