      <p>eh, this popularity award actually doesn't feel that great to win after all of these fanwars started and it turns out we collected way too much gold in excess but maybe it will feel different after seeing the bias actually receive it</p>

      <p>Yeah like gold was really hard to get unless you bought and considering the gap was like 11 million it’s easily 100k plus that could have been spent elsewhere</p>

      <p>I think anon is mixing it with something; so far only 2 solo idols won and it’s sehun and taeyon + w1 as a group and EXO. +21M was another poll I think but with the same trot singer that was our competition
