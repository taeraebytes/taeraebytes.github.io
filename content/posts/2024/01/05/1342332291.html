      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>The same thing applies to Taerae/Gunwook and Rosins akgaes. They only like these two cause they think they are beneath Hao.</p>

      <p>this and also a lot of rosin akgaes hate haobin so they're happy they can finally like some of his friendships in the group. they love to say haorae only main vocals to spite allins</p>

      <p>tbh how I see things, hanbin is a main vocal too. A main vocal position end of the day is someone that gets the most lines and get the high notes, and that's what hanbin is doing along with taerae and Zhang Hao. On dreamcatcher siyeon is not the best vocal but she still holds that position bc she gets the high notes and the most lines, same way that Mina is not even the third best twice dancer but she's still a main dancer bc that's her role on the group</p>

      <p>in a lottt of groups that have actual official positions theyll give leads more than mains its just how it is they base the title usually off of the skill level same with every other position they dont correctly utlizie them theyll go off most popular or company favorites. its like how lisa was the lead rapper in bp but she rapped the most

      <p>I feel like having 3 main vocals for a 9 membered group when your vocals aren't all that is a bit ridiculous homie you are not exo even svt only has 2 I'd even prefer one for zb1 but I get that it's hard bcs haorae are pretty equal in skills they needed someone stronger vocally</p>

      <p>Yeah this is the point, hanbin is not even close to haorae at singing so the main vocal title is ridiculous just because all of highnote parts of him, and hanbin is more like gunwook's level, if allindan want him to get called as main vocal, let's start calling gunwook main vocal too</p>
