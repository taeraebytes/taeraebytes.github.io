      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>The same thing applies to Taerae/Gunwook and Rosins akgaes. They only like these two cause they think they are beneath Hao.</p>

      <p>they still feel threatened about hanbin bc he has more gigs than zh, and if it was about being close then they would like hanbin, like zh even bring him to a dinner with his mother. they started liking taerae when that line distribution pic dropped.</p>
