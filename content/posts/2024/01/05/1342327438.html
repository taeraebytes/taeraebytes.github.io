      <p>Yuehua never promoted him even yujin had more people say it's cuz no one knew he was Chinese but.... he looks so ChineseðŸ˜­ and he has an accent in English I could tell almost immediately but that plus no screentime when cfanbases were focusing on the promoted yuehua trainees and shanghaiz. And then Ricky's fandom fought with mjxs and then rosins bullied criyangis to hell and back so that's kind of why. he has 2nd or 3rd biggest Chinese fandom in the group tho but in the beginning all he had was western fans then Koreans started liking him

      <p>Yujin are bought fans cause the number donâ€™t match the activity in his sp. he never ever trended once like never; while even Hanbin trended for some award i forgot and ricky trended 1 time (apart from his mistreatment)</p>

      <p>He also lost a lot of fans due to dating and him clearly not giving a fuck about fans but I don't think it will affect him in the long run if someone will have a stable career post zb1 it's him</p>
