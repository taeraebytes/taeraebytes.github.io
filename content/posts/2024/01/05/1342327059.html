      <p>Most wishful thinking... I feel like it's realistic to think they'll pretty much all flop after disbandment they're not gp popular at all and that's ok tbh but lemme say 
Jiwoong: Flop actor already too many song kangs cha eunwoos 
Hao: promoting in china (ik he wants to be an idol still but idk) 
Hanbin: web drama actor/mid idol 
Matthew: YouTuber
Taerae: soloist might hit it off with the older gen
Ricky: influencer 
Gyuvin: mid idol/flop actor 
Gunwook: mid idol 
Yujin: probably will b the most popular - idol

They might not flop tho who know it just depends on how they're doing towards the end of their career like 2025 but this is how things are looking and I'm not even being pessimistic and I mean mid like cravity level 

NOBODY JUMP MEEEEEEEEEEEEE
