      <p>Yuehua never promoted him even yujin had more people say it's cuz no one knew he was Chinese but.... he looks so ChineseðŸ˜­ and he has an accent in English I could tell almost immediately but that plus no screentime when cfanbases were focusing on the promoted yuehua trainees and shanghaiz. And then Ricky's fandom fought with mjxs and then rosins bullied criyangis to hell and back so that's kind of why. he has 2nd or 3rd biggest Chinese fandom in the group tho but in the beginning all he had was western fans then Koreans started liking him
