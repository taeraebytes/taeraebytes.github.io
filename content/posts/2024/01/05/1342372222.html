      <p>ok but do we think that Ricky is purposefully buying the same clothes as SKZ Hyunjin or it's just pure coincidence? Bc stays are a bit crazy but ngl I find funny how out of all the collections that Versace has, Ricky pulls up with the exact same clothes.</p>

      <p>I don't think he'd copy someone that disliked by korea but it's funny cuz stays are trying to repeat their own fate from when armys dragged hyunjin for copying taehyung someone said they think Versace might be styling him similarly to jiwoong and hanbin
