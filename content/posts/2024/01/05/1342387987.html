      <p>they are so messy I love them but this is exactly what wk1 deserves, last time for the ear piece one of the zhcbar person had to personally go to wk1 to ask them to answer their mail abt it and this time they have yet to answer abt the mic when when they were the first fb to send the req but 4 fbs have already got the mail for the mics and have started the preparation ages ago so yeah its going to be crazy until then ig</p>
