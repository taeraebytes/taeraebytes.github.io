      <p>That‚Äôs kinda wild tho they got a yuehua manager living in the dorm, and the fact he‚Äôs the one who mistreats Ricky üò≠üò≠ if I was another parent company and I found out one was getting privileges I‚Äôd be kinda pissed tho</p>

      <p>yuehua holds majority of the group it makes sense jellyfish does not gaf hanbins company does not gaf mnh doesnt gaf whatever mystery compnay jiwoong is under doesnrt gaf its very simple actually. And ig because yuehua is partialy involved with schedules they sent a manager for them idk but the person explaining everything said the relationship between that manager and ricky was fine until after the scandal which is still weird i dont think he has a vendetta but he just obviously doesnt care ab ricky and isnt the best to him and jiwoong thats what op said
