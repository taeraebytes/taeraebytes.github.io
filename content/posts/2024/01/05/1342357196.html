    "question": "If gunwook debuts in jellyfish how would you like them to handle it? Like i think gugudan flopped because their debut concept (+ song) and there were too many members, they should have debuted with a girl like me because the rest of their discography is great. Vixx's concepts were really cool, they had great main vocals too so i don't really have complaints about them. I never followed verivery so idk about them. Also i hope they don't drag fansigns for too long like what they did to evnne",
    "reply": "Gugudan weren't too bad off it's just that there was hyper focus on the former ioi members and no one cared about the rest + the fact that sejeongs fans HARRASSED mina I honestly think they did the best for a post ioi group it was just mismanaging and vixx are a well regarded 2nd gen group jelly fish is terrible in so many ways but they can produce better groups than a lot of companies if they weren't so shut I wouldn't mind gunwook debuting there but they've lost their touch and their minds look at what they're doing to evnne ðŸ˜­"
