      <p>I'm p sure that spoiler is him but ig yea but he's utilizing high notes that are special for award shows does it really matter if he gets a dance break (taerae)?? I think he's fine tbh

      <p>On an article it was saying how 4th and 5th gen come together for a suprise so everyone now thinks the fox pic is for yeonjun and the roses for zb1 and the door for bnd and maybe a guilty cover. Though I can’t lie I don’t think they should have the minor members of those groups performing guilty</p>
