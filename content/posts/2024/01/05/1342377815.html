      <p>Most wishful thinking... I feel like it's realistic to think they'll pretty much all flop after disbandment they're not gp popular at all and that's ok tbh but lemme say 
Jiwoong: Flop actor already too many song kangs cha eunwoos 
Hao: promoting in china (ik he wants to be an idol still but idk) 
Hanbin: web drama actor/mid idol 
Matthew: YouTuber
Taerae: soloist might hit it off with the older gen
Ricky: influencer 
Gyuvin: mid idol/flop actor 
Gunwook: mid idol 
Yujin: probably will b the most popular - idol

They might not flop tho who know it just depends on how they're doing towards the end of their career like 2025 but this is how things are looking and I'm not even being pessimistic and I mean mid like cravity level 

NOBODY JUMP MEEEEEEEEEEEEE

      <p>agree yujin seems like he could be the next big thing once he’s older like his visual is so idol-like and he’s a dancer prodigy.. i think haobin wouldn’t flop like that thoo because they’re haobin.. like hanbin wouldn’t just star in web drama he’d aim higher and i can see him become a tv personality that regularly appears in talk shows lmao also even though hao’s more likely to have a career in china he’d still be successful like he’s kinda yuehua china’s next cash gem</p>

      <p>Yea they're popular but they're nowhere near being loved by the gp to achieve anything big post debut hao definitely has the upper hand being loved by a bigger company like that but it depends on how they do later I honestly don't see them doing that well and I'm trying to be objective

      <p>But idk how it will work out for him if he doesn’t go to china because he seems very passionate about kpop and wanting to be a kpop idol, but I can’t see him staying in Korea if he stays with yuehua</p>
