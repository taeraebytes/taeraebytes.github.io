      <p>i saw a few black kkultaraes at kcon la while waiting for m&g and they were all very pretty, but a good majority of them were white americans , europeans, and sea. i only met  one other latina fan for him besides me. i was in line for m&g for like three hours so i was being nosy and people watching LOL. a lot of hanbin fans there were haobin fans and u could tell some of them  were weirdos from the way they’d talk about them😭. i don’t think i saw any yujin fans but there were yujin freebies being passed out in line so there had to be at least one.  but yeah hanbin ricky and matthew have aggressively WHITE fans it was kinda scary. but i can’t even say kcon la was a good measure bc a majority of people there had flown out from different countries, like there were a lot of chinese and korean fans that flew  to america to see them.</p>
