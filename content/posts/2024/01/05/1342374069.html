      <p>Yuehua never promoted him even yujin had more people say it's cuz no one knew he was Chinese but.... he looks so ChineseðŸ˜­ and he has an accent in English I could tell almost immediately but that plus no screentime when cfanbases were focusing on the promoted yuehua trainees and shanghaiz. And then Ricky's fandom fought with mjxs and then rosins bullied criyangis to hell and back so that's kind of why. he has 2nd or 3rd biggest Chinese fandom in the group tho but in the beginning all he had was western fans then Koreans started liking him

      <p>my riyangi moots also told me it's because during bp, posts about ricky were literally banned/ removed immediately on the boys planet super topic on weibo because Hao fans were scared what happened to Xiaoting going from rank 1/2 to rank 9 and barely making it into the lineup would happen to Hao and there were legit propaganda being spread that there is no chance two Chinese members will make it and no way 4 ppl from the same company is possible so it's best to bet it all on Hao and they banned anyone who tried to disapprove it.

All his votes were from international fans and koreans. It's crazy how many korean fans he gained since that subway appearance and overme fanmeet and he got a lot of sympathy votes from the pajama live. Also my moot told me when he ranked 4th chinese fans said he paid his way into the lineup and that mnet favored him ðŸ’€ because they never heard of him but its because you guys banned/ deleted every post about him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ chinese riyangis had to post screenshots showing how viral he went on kforums and tiktok lmao</p>
