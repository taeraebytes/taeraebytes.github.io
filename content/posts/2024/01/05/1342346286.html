      <p>woodz did a ost for it and the song went viral in the korean side because that show was fucking popular over there I donâ€™t know if his song will get the same hype  though since nobody is tuning in for this ugly season</p>

      <p>he is my bias but he can get one in the future it isn't a surprise the two most popular members got one before him. i'm not upset they haven't even debuted 6 months yet so people need to be patient i'm actually happy for him he deserves it especially because he is center. if taerae got one before him can you imagine the dragging that would ensue</p>

      <p>in a survival show setting it does make sense that the two most popular ones would get something first but actually it's not uncommon that unpopular main vocals get sth first exo Chen has been the most unpopular since debut and was the first member to get a solo ost and it blew up completely so....</p>
