      <p>I do not understand wakeone because if I saw a duo pulling these numbers you bet Iâ€™d be plastering them everywhere, at least for a couple months after debut ( but w1 had that whole haobin banðŸ’€) because even the non fans know who they are and they truly could have capitalised on that to expand the fandom</p>

      <p>i think they feared a growing hate for them like people being extremely homophobic thats the only explanation that makes sense but i think they realized they need the duo now
