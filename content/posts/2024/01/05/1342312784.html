      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>that's because matthew isn't saying hanbin is the best person ever born every other day + they dislike his visuals.  hao they have hated  since he got first and then all the fighting has made it worse and they can't accept he is the most popular member. gyuvin has good proportions and visuals, doesn't threaten hanbin's popularity or lines and he is obsessed with hanbin so of course he's their token favorite</p>

      <p>that it's a lie bc matthew keeps saying that hanbin is his role model and how good of a person hanbin is and this and that, they are just angry at him bc of the plushie which it's ridiculous.

someone gift gyuvin a plushie, that's how their fake adoration for gyuvin will fall out.</p>
