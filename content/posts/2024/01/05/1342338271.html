      <p>i dont think its true tho. if it were kfans would cause an uproar. hao is cute, the manager probably sees him as his own child or something</p>

      <p>I mean you can kind of tell he treats hao the best even if it were if he saw him as his own child he keeps him close and I don't think fans care enough to cause and uproar over who's the managers favorites. They just figured out it's him that was yelling at Ricky apparently but rukidans are focusing more on other issues now
