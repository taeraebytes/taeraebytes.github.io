      <p>Yeah I'm talking about the fact that he constantly leeches off Hanbin I promise you they will drop him fast if they see this pattern
(The crazy thing is they call Matthew and Hao leeches when Matthew barely talks about bin and Hao is literally more popular than him)</p>

      <p>Actually afaik most donâ€™t actually know about the issue because the I-fandoms arenâ€™t really letting it hit the I-side itâ€™s big on the kside but many sf on the iside donâ€™t actually know the extent of whatâ€™s going on</p>
