      <p>Zb1 will lose their fandom and hype just like kep1er since there are new boy groups that are debuting and a lot more interesting and younger than them. They fall off badly since riize are getting more popular and having stable fandom</p>

      <p>you talk like they're old or something? Yujins still on the youngest end and besides riize all the other groups have yet to come close to them bnd is the closest and they're not really seen as competitors in any category. And riize don't have a stable fandom why do you think their second release flopped? I'd love for you to have a moment in reality but this is annoying asfk

      <p>when did we lie? their debut was physical yes but talk saxy was digital. but they never won anything w gag bc they didnt promote outside of music shows at all and the song didnt blow up until 2 weeks after it was released and they had already finished music show promotions. there was also a bts member who had a cb in the same week and also bnd who had a cb on the same day and actually had a dedicated fandom that streamed and voted. briize are just there for good vibes and moral support they dont rly do shit</p>
