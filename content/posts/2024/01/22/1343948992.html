      <p>i love my ot9 mutuals they’re so sweet but the problem is that you can’t be critical of the members on ot9 twitter 😭 you see how lit they get with the expose thread pill right? like id probably get stoned for honestly and frankly calling out gyuvin and id get a “moots you follow” in my notifications if i started making jokes about jiwoongs veneers or his gf like ppl do here. idk it’s just the cover of anonymity here that allows people to be honest (and actually funny) here i know there are some other ot9s that feel this way but idk how to find y’all we needa make a gc or something</p>

      <p>Oh yup they act like it's a direct attack on them or smth like it's ok to tell the truth no one will kill you... and their love for exposing people for dumb shit is so annoying who died and made you zerose Jesus tf??? The way that gyuvin translation thread only stayed in my circle lolllll like you cannot reason or have conversations with these dumbasses. Lmaooo it's def the anonymity I know my anons they would rather die than reveal themselves 😭😭😭

      <p>I miss circles my downfall came as soon as they left because it's not even about being an undercover hater if you say anything less than the upmost praise ur a criminal worthy of death
