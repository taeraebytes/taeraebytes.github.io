      <p>affiliated with cults is kinda crazy.. there was a dkz member that got kicked out for that and a bg (e'last i think it was?)'s company is associated with a cult and when fans found out they boycotted everything. if that's true and ever comes out it's over i fear</p>

      <p>I think considering he started training early and was preparing to be an idol it won't blow him over and idt he's like verrrry involved like that guy they might just be in a weird church

      <p>I read a lot of the translated articles and it was around the time the documentary was out I'm sure it's bigger than I think but I don't think gyuvins family is directly involved with a large church that's a cult but I felt bad for him miskeen
