Def sees thing in black n white n has stroooong escapist tendencies 
Likes open-minded, opinionated ppl, who act a bit helpless at times or are a codependent, he might be clingy as well in private

Sxt moon venus; Charming, imaginative n empathetic, he's a great mediator n all those qualities make him popular, has feminine qualities n energy 
Lucky w relationship n money, has good friends, great social skills, good manners, expresses love easily 
Pleasant childhood n usually pleasant romantic relationships

Sq moon Saturn; Might have grown up w negative self image 
He always wonders if he's reacting appropriately to things n works really hard to understand his emotions 
Doesn't trust easily, generally pessimistic, scared to be spontaneous n letting out his inner child 

Sq moon pluto; intense n passionate emotions, he is very caring but prone to jealousy n obsession, he craves intimacy

Very restless mind, he might feel the need to be productive at all times, passionate and sharp
Might have a potty mouth lol prob likes dirty and vulgar jokes, has a clear voice l
He can be quite cunning, he's very quick minded and can jump into things quicker than most
Great at debates and arguments, maybe he argues more than we think? 
An emotional learner if that makes sense 

Mercury conj Jupiter; kind, thoughtful, generous, accepting, wise
Has a lot of ideas, very tolerant and has a strong sense of justice 
He may like literature and learning, very smart but always wants to know more
Probably has a lot of various interests

Boundless ideas and a quick mind
