      <p>I'm sorry that producer was actually insane he was openly just talking shit and I couldn't stop laughing I forgot to record half of it cuz I just was listening to the train wreck he was funny everyone was mad but it was entertaining nobody said anything till like a few hours after but it's not like he was wrong

      <p>YES 😭 he gave gyuvin 4 options it was like dance vocal visual and humility and he asked people to rank them wow me and him have the same brain cuz that's what I thought fjnrmfmemkfkgk this guy was not normal he went on ab how humility was his strongest quality lmaoooooooo. he really liked gunwook tho ugh I just hate how he portrayed him so he can die

      <p>the pd seemed intimidated by gunwook lmaooo or maybe not intimidated but impressed by his nerve. liked him as a tv personality or contestant, definitely. i'm not quoting vertabim but i remember the pd saying he would have peed his pants if he did what gw did during the audition or something like that. brother earned his screentime js (yes his edit for first half of the show was polarizing but i never saw it as bad bc i liked him right away so imagine my surprise by the backlash 😢)</p>

      <p>yes he said that I was like WHAT😭 I think he liked gunwooks confidence and he said himself that he went in strong like that on purpose so goal achieved and I thought he was cute from the beginning too these people are begging it but I get the editing they made him look so domineering
