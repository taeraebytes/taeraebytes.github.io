      <p>Sometimes I wonder how many of hanbin's fans genuinely support him and how many of them are just success stans 

Like rosins are loud but they're also super supportive of hao but I don't get that vibe from allins much?</p>

      <p>most of the ignore his past because they think he couldve changed his mind or because they think he will not act on his sexuality, and will probably marry one of them ðŸ’€ the ones that buy the most and follow him everywhere are gf stans or people that dont really care about him (following him everywhere and taking the picture ones) most lf crosins will leave him once hes not center so its whatever i guess</p>
