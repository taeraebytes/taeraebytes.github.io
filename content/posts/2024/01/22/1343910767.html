      <p>they're getting mass reported by allins because they don't want the zeroses that were in the quotes in the mistranslation yesterday to know it was indeed a mistranslation. plus they're getting threatened by those two c-allin akgaes on twt who started the whole thing saying they'll sue op just cause she exposed their accs on wb where they say nasty shit about zh.</p>

      <p>Actually they went private because that user jade posted that she’s filled a legal report because apparently that user was also spreading misinformation ? 😭 I don’t really know but I do know that the jade person did post a picture of her doing some legal thing</p>
