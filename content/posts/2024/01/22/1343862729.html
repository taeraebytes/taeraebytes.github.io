      <p>in a hypothetical world would u rather have gunwook in future wakeonez or yuehuaz? i feel like heâ€™d stand out more in wakeonez and their fandom would be more accepting but yuehua has zhanghao and better (key word better) management ...</p>

      <p>NEVER EVER WAKEONEEEEEE management aside I hated their trainees except munjung and yuehua minus seungeon are better to me maybe cuz I'm used to them I started hating yuehuaz later into bp but I never liked wakeonez to begin with I really base everything off vibes and I've liked work from yuehua before so there's that
