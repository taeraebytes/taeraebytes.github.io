      <p>the way that gunwook didn't even bother hao, he even said that he wanted to show zeroses his skincare so he was going to ask hanbin to stay at the live for a minute so he could go to the bathroom and get his skincare but then hanbin told him that he was taking a bath so he didn't show his skin care when he could perfectly ask hao to stay at the live but he didn't do that bc he didn't want to bother him so why the hell are they shitting on him. hao decided to leave the room on his own will, didn't he even say that he would go to the living room and drink tea with hanbin before going to sleep? like maybe he just likes it there idk</p>
