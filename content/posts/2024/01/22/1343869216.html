it's coming out that some c-allins might (i don't speak chinese so i can't say for sure) might have bought it themselves. i would not put it past them to be honest but if so i need to see some allins humbled. i dislike both sfs but allins irk me more</p>

      <p>It does have chances of it being them cuz it the texts hinted of them being prepared abt smthg and was sent just few hrs before the truck was revealed and it wasn't smthg like in a panic mode but rather calm so very sus + another text says abt everyone would anyway think crosins were the one who sent the truck and naturally haos reputation would also be affected</p>

      <p>This one bit doesnâ€™t make any sense tho because china is an hour behind Korea not ahead meaning this post was made 10 minutes AFTER the truck was spotted outside wakeone. Plus his c bar also sent two trucks that day asking for legal action so it could have been about that ?</p>
