      <p>i think about how zerobaseone had so much potential at first, like when they debuted they had so much hype (no other bgs had received that much hype back then, not in a long time), they were a survival show group selected randomly by votes and yet their visual chemistry is crazy itâ€™s so satisfying seeing how similar they are with their simple (?) flower boy visuals, theyâ€™re neuro+queer like theyâ€™re bound to be entertaining variety kings if they were not so strictly supervised by their company, taerae couldâ€™ve been more pushed as like, koreaâ€™s new vocal son or whatever (but wakeone refused to give him any payola), rickyâ€™s star potential couldâ€™ve been utilised like thatâ€™s a baddie for real like omg wakeone deserves fucking nothing. people think that the akgaes were the source of the groupâ€™s downfall but tbh their akgaeism was worsened by the companyâ€™s imbalance way of promoting them as individuals and as groups tbh</p>

      <p>anon ur so right, i stan literally every kpop group ever and i have to say the potentiallll these boys have to be HUGE!! iâ€™ll start with positives bc they are doing well for their age, i dont think theyve had a massive downfall because of crush at all and their success, which in some ways higher in debut era, proves they can overcome big4 and hold their own .. if you remove the company, music, and fans away and look at them from a fresh starting board i can say they have (or had) the equivalent to be a next izone, not at the very! top of their gen but still they have varied amount of vocals and visuals its very easy to pick who you bias as they arent all similar ,,
im not gonna go over major complaints like management music dance everyone has heard that story
 but i just think to not complicate things they need one MAJOR variety show zbtv isnt hitting the spot, they are doing too many things at once all while trying to maintain characters? i dont think variety of games and concepts are bad look at run bts, but its very distracting for new viewers when the members talk about their departments or whatever ,, i know its unrealistic but dorm variety would genuinely give them a boost its so loved by all fans ppl love to see their idols at home doing laundry cooking normal things , or at least vlogs at home 
but overall i think they have an ability to bounce back, if zeroses want zb1 to be bigger they cant take a backseat , especially in regulating a safe fandom they cannot let akgaes and solos drown them out anymore, its getting bad on intl kside and cside that its slowly but surely ruining the repuation of zb1 making it harder for new ppl to join and existing fans want to leave,, subfandoms need to learn to forgive and forget,, zeroses in general need to stop akgaes and solos trample on the name zerose like stand on business , why are you letting ppl believe ( also saying ur self) that zeroses gave up on member x y or z if you know ur ot9?? no, try ur best to support all the members but if you dont stream x y z solo activities it doesnt make u a fake, these solos are just looking for vessels to project out onto</p>
