      <p>they're getting mass reported by allins because they don't want the zeroses that were in the quotes in the mistranslation yesterday to know it was indeed a mistranslation. plus they're getting threatened by those two c-allin akgaes on twt who started the whole thing saying they'll sue op just cause she exposed their accs on wb where they say nasty shit about zh.</p>
