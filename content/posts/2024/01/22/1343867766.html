      <p>Sometimes I wonder how many of hanbin's fans genuinely support him and how many of them are just success stans 

Like rosins are loud but they're also super supportive of hao but I don't get that vibe from allins much?</p>

      <p>most of the ignore his past because they think he couldve changed his mind or because they think he will not act on his sexuality, and will probably marry one of them ðŸ’€ the ones that buy the most and follow him everywhere are gf stans or people that dont really care about him (following him everywhere and taking the picture ones) most lf crosins will leave him once hes not center so its whatever i guess</p>

      <p>Donâ€™t misunderstand hao is extremely talented and charismatic and would have gained a lot of fans either way but there is a reason his fandom, especially his c fandom practically exploded overnight after the final. There is a lot of nationalistic pride in having 1st place be from your country and the centre. You may not agree with it now but once zb1 disbands and he a) either goes solo or b) redebut with yuehuaz but they donâ€™t have him as centre just watch how many of those token stans drop. He will still have a lot of support but just like for the rest of the boys he will loose fans once this group disbands.</p>
