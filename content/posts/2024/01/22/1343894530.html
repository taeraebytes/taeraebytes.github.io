I think we've said everything ab Taurus through haos moon and bins Venus but yeah he's chill, there's a sense of stability about him, he's sensual and enjoys the finer things in life , can be materialistic, loves food, is pretty, has a nice voice, is stubborn, possessive in all areas love objects friends etc, loves art, hard worker when he works but can be quite lazy


Gemini moon; nervous and anxious 
Pleasant, witty n charming but can be moody n irritable at home, well liked 
Better at comforting people logically rather than emotionally
Super curious n always wants to learn things n tea, tendency to overthink
Loves chatting n socializing but switches up real fast like can go from laughing to serious very quickly 
Open minded, fun n mischievous, pranksters can talk for hours ab anything but his emotions 
Easy going n very funny, prob a homebody 
CEO of emotional detachment, might suddenly not gaf ab something bcs he prefers things to be lighthearted n fun rather than intense n dramatic 
Vibes w a lot of people but generally lonely, few close friends 
Likes unpredictable ppl that are kinda all over the place n funny cause he gets bored easily 
Prob had multiple caretakers in childhood or multiple homes, close to his sibs, he might have grown up mostly on his own, he might have a casual fun talk over coffee relationship w his mom, not super deep
Might be overly rational n feel misunderstood 

Sq moon Jupiter; indifferent to others 
Very restless, can overindulge in shopping or gambling etc.
Outgoing n gets along w people well, funny
Moody, inconsistent emotions, inconsistent in gen, lack of self discipline
This goes for a lot of his aspects but he struggles w commitment of any kind
Major procrastinator n lacks motivation 

Moon sq Uranus ; again, restless, susceptible, stubborn n has frequent changes of mind, might be a ghoster
This goes for a lot again but he has a very short attention span n struggles to concentrate 
Social, professional n love life are all unstable, he desires closeness but is afraid when people get too close
Very unpredictable placement, he can be detached yet sympathetic you never know how he's going to be 
His mind can be chaotic he's so contradictory he wants to be seen but also blend in, to be close to ppl but also to be alone
He might see himself as super logical but he can be kinda irrational 
Likely liberal or at least open minded 
There's an absent parent in some ways

Trn moon Neptune; kind n compassionate 
Deep connection w music, he loves music there's a natural affinity, artsy
He can overidealize his lover but one mistake n the disappointment is Grand 
Bigg daydreamer, head in the clouds
Very caring n empathetic, might unconsciously adopt his loved ones habits
