      <p>Speaking of zb1 as rapper I think it's hilarious bcs Hanbin is a Gemini w pisces moon and two top critically claimed rappers also have those placements (Kanye, Kendrick-he actually has a lot of similar placements to Kanye and ik several other rappers are pisces moon like mf Doom) so maybe dropping a critically claimed rap albums is what he's meant to do...
Also Hao has almost exactly the same chart as lil Uzi vert I'm gonna look up Gunwook wait</p>
