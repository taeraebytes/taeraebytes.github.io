      <p>Honestly, i think these days jiwoong has been making more efforts to interact/be closer with the other members? It started with ppusamz talking again, then he started interacted with hao too, when he lifted hao's hand it was adorable (i was there but pretty far and gyuvin talked right after so i thought it was gyuvin who lifted hao's hand), and i just saw this and it looks cute? IDK jiwoong's image and impression started getting better to me this year maybe it's just me
