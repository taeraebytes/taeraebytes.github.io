      <p>The dance shouldve been between haohanbin (fujoshis would go crazy) gunwookhanbin (maindancers) or yujingunwook (maknaes). Matthew and hanbin have no dance chemistry because their dancing styles are too different</p>

      <p>Matthew and hanbin definitely have the most contrasting dance lines out of the dance members he probably would suit smth with gunwook but the height gap.... hm I think it was cool to experiment but it's the entire performance that was sloppy not really their chemistry hanbin wasn't hitting it either they barely had time to practice
