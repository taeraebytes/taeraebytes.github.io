      <p>im sorry but the matthew and hanbin intro was really useless. they shouldve just done a hao and hanbin dance intro if it was gonna be two members, or they shouldve let the intro be done by gunwook and hanbin as main dancers. wakeone is stupid</p>

      <p>I woke up too late so I missed the performance I'm gonna look apparently there was smth with Ricky and hanbin????? Ok I just checked that was Matthew JFJJDJFJJFNFNN I can tell they're genuinely attempting something with these dances but they're missing something like it's just not as satisfying as they can be. I think the issue is the put dance breaks before they perform and then remix the songs and that's it. The dance break and remixed song also have like nothing to do with each other instead of tying togetherðŸ¤” whatever it is they need to fix that and add them in the middle of the song the tmh dance break was so lit

      <p>It looks like they didn't practice the mattbin dance enough also they focus too much on dance performances when that's not their strength as a group and they're not really memorable I think if they wanna stand out they should go for an izone or a great western song cover w little back track, I don't wanna be negative cause the perfs aren't bad by any means I just think the competition is high and they're not standing out w their strategy</p>

      <p>Noooo don't get me wrong I think they did good too but I really could see them doing a lot better they're talented dancers I just hate that they're not being used to the fullest extent

      <p>Oop but I'm saying they did bad but they looked mismatched and not rehearsed enough, considering Hanbin said they barely had time to rehearse the haobin intro I think their schedule is stacked and thus should focus on a song intro instead of another dance intro that imo as an old Kpop Stan is overfone</p>

      <p>They did look sloppy yea I didn't think it was too bad not like it's a huge step down from their other performances I really hope they take these performances into more consideration they're importanttt
