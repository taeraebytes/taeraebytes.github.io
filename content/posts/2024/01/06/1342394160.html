      <p>Most wishful thinking... I feel like it's realistic to think they'll pretty much all flop after disbandment they're not gp popular at all and that's ok tbh but lemme say 
Jiwoong: Flop actor already too many song kangs cha eunwoos 
Hao: promoting in china (ik he wants to be an idol still but idk) 
Hanbin: web drama actor/mid idol 
Matthew: YouTuber
Taerae: soloist might hit it off with the older gen
Ricky: influencer 
Gyuvin: mid idol/flop actor 
Gunwook: mid idol 
Yujin: probably will b the most popular - idol

They might not flop tho who know it just depends on how they're doing towards the end of their career like 2025 but this is how things are looking and I'm not even being pessimistic and I mean mid like cravity level 

NOBODY JUMP MEEEEEEEEEEEEE

      <p>agree yujin seems like he could be the next big thing once heâ€™s older like his visual is so idol-like and heâ€™s a dancer prodigy.. i think haobin wouldnâ€™t flop like that thoo because theyâ€™re haobin.. like hanbin wouldnâ€™t just star in web drama heâ€™d aim higher and i can see him become a tv personality that regularly appears in talk shows lmao also even though haoâ€™s more likely to have a career in china heâ€™d still be successful like heâ€™s kinda yuehua chinaâ€™s next cash gem</p>

      <p>Yea they're popular but they're nowhere near being loved by the gp to achieve anything big post debut hao definitely has the upper hand being loved by a bigger company like that but it depends on how they do later I honestly don't see them doing that well and I'm trying to be objective

      <p>But idk how it will work out for him if he doesnâ€™t go to china because he seems very passionate about kpop and wanting to be a kpop idol, but I canâ€™t see him staying in Korea if he stays with yuehua</p>

      <p>idk guys even if he goes back to china his chance of making it there will still be slim cause its not that easy unless he goes into a survival show there. if he gets into acting there he will have to do a bunch of dramas until one hits it big like what happened with yibo with the untamed. he will obviously make big money regardless but idk if hell hit big fr</p>

      <p>Yea he'd make a lot of money but seeing as he's only popular in china in new gen kpop terms and not actually popular there yea his chances are slimðŸ˜­ I just think it's more worth his time to at least be making more money in your home country but ig being a kpop idol is more satisfying for him and his dream

      <p>Yeah idk why people think the idol market it that big in China when itâ€™s arguably way easier to make it bigger in sk. If he went back to China heâ€™d 100% have to do a lot of variety or dramas to get his name out there along with his music</p>

      <p>idols in china are pointless, they don't care bout charts therefore theres no reason to have weekly music programs so theres no point in learning chorography, no point practicing etc. Thats why cnets were like stop doing produce like shows because nothing happens, they form a group go on tour in china and thats it. Then popular members get acting/ variety gigs while the leftover members rot in their dorms until contract is over.</p>
