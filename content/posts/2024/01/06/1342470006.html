      <p>thats a lie even the worst of dancers can keep in sync for a dance break even if they arent having the sharpest moves or charismatic expressions, i've never seen taerae miss a step whilst hanbins badly voice stands out next to two good vocalists he sounds like his running out of breath every time he sings</p>

      <p>The least of his problems is being on sync when he's this stiff, and taerae is no chen or baekhyun for you to be acting like he's some crazy vocalist. 5th gen vocal level is that low that you think taerae is some vocal powerhouse</p>

      <p>lily and ningning can be considered powerhouse vocalists tbh, even haewon and winter if we take into account the fact that some people consider idols like jihyo as powerhouse vocalists</p>

      <p>I think at least for female idols it's always been better for male idols no they're no longer around but I will say tbz had some of the best 4th gen male vocalists
