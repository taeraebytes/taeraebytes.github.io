      <p>thats a lie even the worst of dancers can keep in sync for a dance break even if they arent having the sharpest moves or charismatic expressions, i've never seen taerae miss a step whilst hanbins badly voice stands out next to two good vocalists he sounds like his running out of breath every time he sings</p>

      <p>The least of his problems is being on sync when he's this stiff, and taerae is no chen or baekhyun for you to be acting like he's some crazy vocalist. 5th gen vocal level is that low that you think taerae is some vocal powerhouse</p>
