      <p>i feel like it takes alot to rile hao up cuz hes generally chill so jiwoong’s personality must be actual dogshit… i also think hao’s the type to hold grudges where if u cross the line it’ll take a lot for him to be cool w u again (like how him and gyuvin didnt talk for a week after their argument)</p>

      <p>I think hao can get annoyed easily but to upset him it takes a lot and he's not very forgiving so yea jiwoong must have seriously irked him
