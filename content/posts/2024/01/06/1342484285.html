Hanbin would have all the numbers in symbols in his dn

Taerae.. NAHðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he would be boring and probably on local twt and posts his game screenshots and stats and that's it 
Ricky yea hed probably post himself a lot with gay ass captions
Gyuvin would be on more troll twitter he does not seem like he rates Eminem 
Gunwook yea he'd be more local twt as well
