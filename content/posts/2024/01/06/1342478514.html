      <p>I'm genuinely so sick of these begs terrorizing the whole fandom everytime hanbin gets hate like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ yeah that's terrible or whatever but everyone does and he doesn't even get the most shit. like one c-haobinist today literally threatened to bring a banner to gda to show it to zh and it could literally be classified as sexual harassment. imagine every sf doing this shit every time their fav got hate like SHUT THE FUCK UP OJ KY GOFFFFF they act like he's the most hated idol ever they won't survive a day stanning wonyoung.</p>

      <p>He definitely gets a lot of hate which is sad but to say he gets the most isn't entirely true and I've only ever seen their sf weaponize onto the fandom and accuse people like that fan was out of their mind bringing that sign and ngl it's sexual harassment towards hanbin as well it's just so annoying and old how they act

      <p>you bitches are so dumb and clueless but in case you didn't know c-haobinists are the BIGGEST zh antis on this planet they harass zh on his bubble like crazy if he doesn't interact with hb and they use ch bitch they obviously only target zh don't fucking piss me off. they literally bullied zh for introducing himself as the center so many times why do you think he hasn't introduced himself as center for so long</p>
