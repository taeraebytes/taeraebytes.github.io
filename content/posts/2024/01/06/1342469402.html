      <p>I opened instiz because of our roty and bonsang but.. there are a lot of “hate” articles😭😭 and yes this is about haobinjin. 

today hb was the opening and also with Haorae, they said "so the schedule will be 1 fix member + random members", hb fans thought it was written by rosins so they responded with articles like "why didn’t you be happy with other member schedule?" "why are you never satisfied?" AND "why don't you guys criticize hyj too"🤣🤣 and boom lots of articles criticizing rosins for "their behavior" to hyj, how chinese and overseas fans treat yj etc and rosins thought it was written by allins😭😭 and then there’s article “only ricky’s fans can complain about schedule” and the comments… “there’s no ricky’s fans here” 
PLEASE OPEN INSTIZ!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>

      <p>genuine question: does anybody other than allins (and by extention kinda other sfs) care about that website? is it even popular? i've heard it's like not even top 100 most visited websites in sk</p>
