      <p>i feel like it takes alot to rile hao up cuz hes generally chill so jiwoongâ€™s personality must be actual dogshitâ€¦ i also think haoâ€™s the type to hold grudges where if u cross the line itâ€™ll take a lot for him to be cool w u again (like how him and gyuvin didnt talk for a week after their argument)</p>

      <p>I think hao can get annoyed easily but to upset him it takes a lot and he's not very forgiving so yea jiwoong must have seriously irked him

      <p>He said that when someone asked about his fights with Hanbin, but we need to take into consideration that it's different when you fight with your friend vs with someone you barely like.</p>
