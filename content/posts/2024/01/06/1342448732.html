      <p>im sorry but the matthew and hanbin intro was really useless. they shouldve just done a hao and hanbin dance intro if it was gonna be two members, or they shouldve let the intro be done by gunwook and hanbin as main dancers. wakeone is stupid</p>

      <p>I woke up too late so I missed the performance I'm gonna look apparently there was smth with Ricky and hanbin????? Ok I just checked that was Matthew JFJJDJFJJFNFNN I can tell they're genuinely attempting something with these dances but they're missing something like it's just not as satisfying as they can be. I think the issue is the put dance breaks before they perform and then remix the songs and that's it. The dance break and remixed song also have like nothing to do with each other instead of tying togetherðŸ¤” whatever it is they need to fix that and add them in the middle of the song the tmh dance break was so lit
