      <p>Never liked him he was mean to gyuvin during love killa, and he keeps being a bad hyung. I wouldnâ€™t care if he wasnâ€™t lying but he is trying to sell an image he is not. Him yelling to Ricky as well, it pisses me off; and his attempt to yaoibait with gyuvin who 6 years YOUNGER THAN HIM</p>
