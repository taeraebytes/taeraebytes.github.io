      <p>taerae is gayyyy i didnt even think that until a few months ago but there is literally no reason to make thirst traps that pander to gay men unless that's a majority of your fanbase (not true for him), you're trying to make fujos think you're gay (gyuvin would do this bc he's insane but other straight zb1 members would not), or you're gay yourself</p>

      <p>the funniest part was finding out he wasn't like super serious about church? ðŸ˜­ he recently said he hasn't had time to go to church for a while now and him just using "amen! hallelujah!" when someone complimented him at a fan sign ðŸ˜­ I honestly think the band oppa thingy is way more true for him</p>
