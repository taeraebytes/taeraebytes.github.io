      <p>I'm surprised they choreographed the entire song. idk how common it is but when i see big4 i noticed they commission(?) 2-5 different dance studios to choreograph their songs and then the company picks and chooses which choreo fits best and compile it together. maybe w1 didnt believe in zb1 early on and didn't expect them to break the 1 million seller with yits so they just used one choreographer. pretty sure w1 was already working on in bloom during boys planet too so i wouldnt be surprise if thats the case.

pls i hope w1 uses the money they made and invest in better choreo T_T</p>
