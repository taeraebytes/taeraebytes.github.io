thats why when they wanted to kick seunghan a lot of ot7 were like NOOOOOOOO we gonna have no singers left and our number 1 singer rep is just as bad as seunghans so he might get kicked too. So when they did eventually kick seunghan a lot of now rice are changing their mindset with sohee by calling him cute and adorable and shit, trying to forget his past because if sohee gets kicked too group is for reals doomed.</p>
