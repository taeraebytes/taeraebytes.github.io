This is so funny and reminded me of that anon who said allins are so much nastier on priv because how are you as an alleged "ot9" interact with and follow akgaes out in the open but get mad someone is not praising your fav or calling him main vocal? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ These people are so obnoxious and then getting away with it while terrorizing everyone else is my villain origin story.</p>

      <p>yeah well they're gonna keep terrorizing everyone unless big zerose accs start calling them out and stop being pussies cause why do their manic tweets whining about how no one likes hb in the fandom get so much engagement but no one cares when they're exposed? useless ass fandom they're gonna be the downfall of this group before it even disbands.</p>

      <p>Rosins tried several times to call them out but zerose didn't care because they thought its's just rosins vs allins like always, you must be blind to not notice there are so many allins akgae with big followers and get hundreds likes easily eventhough it's a hate tweet, but with rosins just some trolls less than hundred followers</p>
