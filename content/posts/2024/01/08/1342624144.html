      <p>Tbh so far only the legit xenophobia that goes to Ricky he is always being mistreated by wk1 they messed up his passport twice yelled at him,banned him from doing bbl live and for hao sorry rosins inserting everywhere in our business is not permited at all cs hao got enough spotlight everywhere he has screentime lines everything also look how they r shoving him into dance brk when he is completely not in dance line. They arranged lee mujin and yes he got ost too rosins screaming abt hao is sabotaged he has no lines he has no jobs bruh like Stan Ricky for one day u will know what's the legit xenophobia</p>

      <p>The second passport issue has nothing to do with wakeone they do not control who gets work visas and Ricky was getting an entirely new passport that just wasn't ready in time the first time was bad yea but it was them miscommunication towards the foreign members and being unprepared. I mean hao is center and a decent dancer they have Ricky a solo part as wellðŸ˜­. Yea stanning Ricky is worse ig he's just not as valuable compared to hao
