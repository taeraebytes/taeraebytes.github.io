      <p>i find it funny when ppl think anton debuted bc of nepotism bc while he may have gotten into sm bc of connections, sm does not need nepo clout, esp when 2 of the members of its new group were ex members of one of the biggest bgs at the time. what did help him debut was the fact he’s a native english speaker. sm has been chasing global viralism for their groups for years and have never been able to get it, out of everyone in the big 4, they’re the only company who hasn’t been able to connect to the west (meanwhile bts, newjeans, txt (hybe), blackpink (yg), stray kids (jyp)). they tried w aespa at coachella and then the english single but neither made much noise. aespa is literally getting a full english album before they even have a full korean album. people called nepotism on giselle (which was debunked) bc she was obviously not debut ready but it’s the same thing like she’s fluent in english (+ japanese) and has western humor. JOHNNY the biggest dozen in sm currently was supposed to debut in EXO like sm definitely wanted to be the first to break to the west and then bts came out of nowhere and took it. also riize’s social media so obviously caters to western/global audiences which is funny bc they’re doing so well in domestic charts and sm kinda dgaf. 90% of the ig posts r in english, they always have eng subs even before japanese subs, the tiktok comments are what brought a lot of intl attention and once sm saw that, they had anton take over bc he understands american internet humor and culture a lot better (u can literally see transition between comments done by an obv grown ass social med intern and comments written by an american teenager). people who blindly shout nepo baby are stupid bc they fail to see the obvious marketing tactic. also why 90% of the get a guitar promo was done for a western audience (their first korean variety show appearance was just filmed like a week ago) like them meeting w all those popular tiktokers, i guarantee u sm had no idea gag would blow up in korea the way it did. like if anton was just korean and there was another trainee w the same exact skill set as him who was american, sm would’ve picked the american over him easily.</p>

      <p>Oh yea I agree it was so obvious they were not going for the Korean market their very first appearance was in la and they spoiled a prerelease seeing as how they're not shifting to a more korean push idk if they're going to change to it they probably gonna try to do both with a focus on america

      <p>well zb1 got like 2 group variety shows on debut 2 knowing bros special eps and then 2 w the car crash and then idk what else i forgot a lot of solo and group shit. riize got one and the lee hyori thing. sm probably only payolad for you quiz the other is more recent and they’ve been growing in sk so they might’ve just been invited i don’t think it’s all that big i’ve never heard of it zb1 has been getting the luxury treatment lowkey</p>

      <p>lee hyoris show is good and it's only been getting bigger since Jennie's been on but the thing is sm had no intention of promoting riize like that on Korean shows until they started doing well digitally they had a global focus and were using their payola to fly out white tiktokers so yes sm is more luxury if they're going on shows w double the ratings that zb1 went on im just saying comparing the two there's a clear diff in quality because nobody watches knowing bros and they went on special episodes where the views sliced in half
