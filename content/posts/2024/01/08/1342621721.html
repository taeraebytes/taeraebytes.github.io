      <p>I think it's also because Ricky's family went with him. A lot of the deranged/ unhinged exchange students their families just send them there by themselves and they live with host families who can't really say anything to them so they don't have any accountability or authority and do w.e they want cause they have money. And if the host family can no longer deal with them and their attitude they just find another host family.

Might sound weird but I like his mom just from the way he talks about her u can tell he loves her and isn't afraid to show it.</p>
