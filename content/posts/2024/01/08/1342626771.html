      <p>taerae is gayyyy i didnt even think that until a few months ago but there is literally no reason to make thirst traps that pander to gay men unless that's a majority of your fanbase (not true for him), you're trying to make fujos think you're gay (gyuvin would do this bc he's insane but other straight zb1 members would not), or you're gay yourself</p>

      <p>taeraes definitely a virgin but like he’s never shown attraction to girls like at all 😭 like not even pointing out a girl he finds cute or talking about female celebrities he likes, no past anecdotes, i don’t even think he fake flirts on fancalls??? (although i don’t watch them often so i could be wrong) every other member other than hao has at least shown some signs they like girls but for taerae it’s nothing thats why i don’t believe y’all 😭 coupled with the fact that he’s like almost exclusively friends with gay people and he acts like a twink come on… i mean the only thing is that he’s a church boy but let’s be serious that never stopped anyone</p>

      <p>Ok why would he talk ab girls he finds cute and female celebs that's like... taboo and he isn't almost exclusively friends with gay ppl 😭 we barely saw him in the show yea he spent time w woongi and seowon on cam but there were probably more friendships he had that were never seen and his closest friend is munjung so idk I just feel like genuinely he isn't I don't see it

      <p>ok i said almost damn 😒 and yeah it’s an exaggeration but idk out of the friendships we know of it just seems like a pattern 🌝 and i was just saying the talking about girls thing cuz i’m genuinely trying to think of anything that points to him being straight and i literally can’t think of anything. “vibes” just isn’t enough to convince me sorry :/

anyways you’re obviously not gonna be convinced (even tho youre still wrong 😒) i’ll leave it alone until another anon pisses me off by saying that taerae pretends to be gay cuz he’s obsessed with gay people or some shit (y’all he just acts like that leave him alone 😭)</p>
