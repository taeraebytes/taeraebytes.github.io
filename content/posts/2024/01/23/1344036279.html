      <p>This is how I would've managed their careers
-During that predebut period they get bubble (weverse would've been better but hybe beef so we do with what we have) and they do group or subunit lives once every 2 weeks, they can do a short one in the practice room to garner hype, semi frequent tiktoks doesn't have to be funny it can be yeonjun like thirst traps
-Zb1 camp
-we got other choreographers and Hanbin participates if he has timeüôè
-we don't change yits it's a great mini and in bloom is a great title but we need better styling WE'RE THROWING THE JEANS AWAAAY and zh should get a catchy hair color maybe silver
-they should sing live in the dance practice like nmixx and itzy so it could be reposted on tt
-we limit the festival and radio appearances, one or two is enough, instead we do more group lives

-during the break bw cbs they drop some fast covers on YouTube even low efforts ones, when the content gets really dry they should post a haobin cover or duo dance to wake up the fd
-they debut variety show it should focus on group chemistry the second seventeen mbti episode is easy low effort content that can still be entertaining and showcase chemistry

-i wouldn't pick crush as the tt but if we must, then melpo is released as a surprise pre release single and they make cute snow core or whatever tiktoks to promote it
-they use literally any other part of the song as the teaser

For jpn cb as I said a poppy type track and for Korean cb maybe something like blooming days exo cbx</p>
