      <p>bruh i just saw a tweet notification i got from zb1's twitter and it says "zerobaseone is on the cover of [spotify playlist]" but the pic is just of zhang hao (and like yeah his name and ost title is in the hashtags of the tweet but still) maybe i'm overthinking it bc i'm traumatised from the past week's events but why do i feel like we're gonna have another bout of war from akgaes LORD SEND THE FUCKING FLOOD</p>
