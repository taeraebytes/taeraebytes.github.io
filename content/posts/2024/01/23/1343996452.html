      <p>different anon i was so hyped when they were in jeju (minus ricky being left behind) because they suddenly appeared at the airport and my heart was beating so fast everytime a new ssg pic dropped. I know I shouldnt say that knowing the boys were hella stressed because of them but I couldnt help myself back then, this was their first content as zb1 unlike kcon where they were still singing bp stuff. Like jeju was the beginning of a new era</p>
