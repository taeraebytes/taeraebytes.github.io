      <p>bruh i just saw a tweet notification i got from zb1's twitter and it says "zerobaseone is on the cover of [spotify playlist]" but the pic is just of zhang hao (and like yeah his name and ost title is in the hashtags of the tweet but still) maybe i'm overthinking it bc i'm traumatised from the past week's events but why do i feel like we're gonna have another bout of war from akgaes LORD SEND THE FUCKING FLOOD</p>

      <p>PERIOD ANON. the way entirety of zerose twt was jumping every single rosin and saying they were being dramatic and annoying. remember how  they made him sign hundreds of albums all by himself while he was sick, that freaking stupid 10min show they uploaded just on wb to calm c-rosins down... ugh they really treated him like shit in debut era wow.</p>
