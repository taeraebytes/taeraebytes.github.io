Crybaby but feels a lot in general like laughs a lot too, his sense of humor might be a little silly n odd, freaky on the low
Def sees thing in black n white n has stroooong escapist tendencies 
Likes open-minded, opinionated ppl, who act a bit helpless at times or are a codependent, he might be clingy as well in private

Sxt moon venus; Charming, imaginative n empathetic, he's a great mediator n all those qualities make him popular, has feminine qualities n energy 
Lucky w relationship n money, has good friends, great social skills, good manners, expresses love easily 
Pleasant childhood n usually pleasant romantic relationships

Sq moon Saturn; Might have grown up w negative self image 
He always wonders if he's reacting appropriately to things n works really hard to understand his emotions 
Doesn't trust easily, generally pessimistic, scared to be spontaneous n letting out his inner child 

Sq moon pluto; intense n passionate emotions, he is very caring but prone to jealousy n obsession, he craves intimacy
He needs devotion from his lover, n love n sex goes hand in hand for him both bring both immense pleasure n pain to him tho

Mercury in Gemini; I've already said it for the other girl but yeah great communicator, witty, smart, great storyteller maybe a bit of a liar for the sake of the story, very curious 
Makes sense that he's a great mc, they speak fast but coherently and clearly, he's also quick minded and knowledgeable, ppl find him smart
He might learn fast too and have a good memory, prob moves around a lot
Prob has a short attention span and is very impatient , matt also has this 

Mercury opp mars; again, very nervous 
Very restless mind, he might feel the need to be productive at all times, passionate and sharp
Might have a potty mouth lol prob likes dirty and vulgar jokes, has a clear voice l
He can be quite cunning, he's very quick minded and can jump into things quicker than most
Great at debates and arguments, maybe he argues more than we think? 
An emotional learner if that makes sense 

Mercury conj Jupiter; kind, thoughtful, generous, accepting, wise
Has a lot of ideas, very tolerant and has a strong sense of justice 
He may like literature and learning, very smart but always wants to know more
Probably has a lot of various interests
Socially successful and charismatic 

Mercury trn Uranus; again, super intelligent, detailed and analytical 
Boundless ideas and a quick mind
Might be attracted to eccentricity 
Adaptable and a great problem solver
Prob spends a lot of time online and might feel like he communicates better through text/writing 
Kinda weird and might feel insane or other ppl find him insane but he's wise</p>
