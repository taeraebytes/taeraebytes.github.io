      <p>i find it really weird how wk1 is not responding to any demands... like the hb hashtags have been trending for days the least they could do to shut these people up is put out a statement like idgi. it's like they insist on keeping chaos in the fandom</p>

      <p>they're not gonna acknowledge people asking for legal action and the protection thing is an internal effort and a legal team which they don't have and responding to the issue would further escalate things because it's finally starting to calm down
