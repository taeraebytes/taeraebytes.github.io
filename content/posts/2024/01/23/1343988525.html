      <p>gyuvin does a lot of really really dumb stuff but i just can’t hate him for it, at least not yet. i hope he matures but i find him so likable even now which may sound kind of bad.</p>

      <p>except for T and are you a T is a meme in korea because type T's are stereotyped to make every situation serious and ruins the mood LOL

To me I feel like Gyuvin is your typical spoiled rich kid who was never told no when he was little, like he be yapping and yapping but no one corrects him or tells him when he crosses the line with jokes. So I feel like this is his first time catching it/ getting corrected which may be why he seemed down lately because it never happened before, but it's for the better.
