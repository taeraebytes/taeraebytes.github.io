    "question": "diff anon, since I'm into birth charts imo the casual relationship means he'll have a lot of casual relationship as in acquaintances/ friendships but that's the extent, nothing more. That's due to him being attractive and his open minded personality, his ability to absorb himself with his surrounding and to turn a tense atmosphere into a light hearted one and people around him are attracted to him for those reason therefore they want to get to know him more but that feeling is always one sided, hardly ever reflected. \n\nHe does not trust easily so he is selective with who he shares his inner thoughts with, his true feelings, his true self. And only a few people in his life will ever get to experience that. And that's where the contradiction and commitment issues comes in. He has the ability to befriend a lot of people, get into a lot of relationships due to him being naturally attractive visually and personality wise and all he has to do is return the one sided feelings but at the same time he's selective with who he shares his true self with and how he decides that is up to him. To him, best friends and relationships are taken very seriously and he won't easily give that title to anyone, that's where his issue with commitment comes in. For an example I'll use bestfriend, a lot of people pass around the best friend title to just about anybody but their actions and words do not match that title as in having their back through thick and thin etc. But to him he won't give you the best friend title unless he's willing to commit to that tittle, going through thick and thin. If you in jail he'll chant \"free REQUEEFIEM\" you know that kinda thing. Same thing for a partner, he won't get into a relationship unless he's willing to commit for life.",
