      <p>idk why it wont let me send the whole thing but part two to my reply

I actually was curious and went digging for some of his fansigns and that's exactly what it seems like. His answers to those thirsty fans are always soulmate, love you more than 2.5 years, let's grow old together etc. and all his answers have "forever" undertones. I'm not saying he won't flirt, in fact he seems flirtatious but that's the extent nothing more. He's not the type to have casual flings, rather he longs for one serious relationship and again how he decides that is up to him. 

Also another thing I want to point out is how he wants to be seen but be alone. Being seen as in an idol, seen to the world but at the same time he values being alone hence being a homebody or having hobbies being alone. Watching dramas, shopping alone etc. So yeah that's just my opinion because his birth chart specifically can be misinterpreted because of how unique it is.</p>
