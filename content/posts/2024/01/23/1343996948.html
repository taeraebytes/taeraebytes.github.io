      <p>i think about how zerobaseone had so much potential at first, like when they debuted they had so much hype (no other bgs had received that much hype back then, not in a long time), they were a survival show group selected randomly by votes and yet their visual chemistry is crazy itâ€™s so satisfying seeing how similar they are with their simple (?) flower boy visuals, theyâ€™re neuro+queer like theyâ€™re bound to be entertaining variety kings if they were not so strictly supervised by their company, taerae couldâ€™ve been more pushed as like, koreaâ€™s new vocal son or whatever (but wakeone refused to give him any payola), rickyâ€™s star potential couldâ€™ve been utilised like thatâ€™s a baddie for real like omg wakeone deserves fucking nothing. people think that the akgaes were the source of the groupâ€™s downfall but tbh their akgaeism was worsened by the companyâ€™s imbalance way of promoting them as individuals and as groups tbh</p>

      <p>anon ur so right, i stan literally every kpop group ever and i have to say the potentiallll these boys have to be HUGE!! iâ€™ll start with positives bc they are doing well for their age, i dont think theyve had a massive downfall because of crush at all and their success, which in some ways higher in debut era, proves they can overcome big4 and hold their own .. if you remove the company, music, and fans away and look at them from a fresh starting board i can say they have (or had) the equivalent to be a next izone, not at the very! top of their gen but still they have varied amount of vocals and visuals its very easy to pick who you bias as they arent all similar ,,
im not gonna go over major complaints like management music dance everyone has heard that story
 but i just think to not complicate things they need one MAJOR variety show zbtv isnt hitting the spot, they are doing too many things at once all while trying to maintain characters? i dont think variety of games and concepts are bad look at run bts, but its very distracting for new viewers when the members talk about their departments or whatever ,, i know its unrealistic but dorm variety would genuinely give them a boost its so loved by all fans ppl love to see their idols at home doing laundry cooking normal things , or at least vlogs at home 
but overall i think they have an ability to bounce back, if zeroses want zb1 to be bigger they cant take a backseat , especially in regulating a safe fandom they cannot let akgaes and solos drown them out anymore, its getting bad on intl kside and cside that its slowly but surely ruining the repuation of zb1 making it harder for new ppl to join and existing fans want to leave,, subfandoms need to learn to forgive and forget,, zeroses in general need to stop akgaes and solos trample on the name zerose like stand on business , why are you letting ppl believe ( also saying ur self) that zeroses gave up on member x y or z if you know ur ot9?? no, try ur best to support all the members but if you dont stream x y z solo activities it doesnt make u a fake, these solos are just looking for vessels to project out onto</p>

      <p>I think solo member fanbases should collaborate, like imagine shb global and zh global collaborating.

Solos are not the problem because at the end most of us only care about our faves but they should understand that if the group sinks their fave sinks.

Honestly I think self-Made content wouldn't hit big at this point, they should get a collaboration with a famous YouTube channel.</p>

      <p>yes they defo need to be on some famous youtube show but it cant be a boring member like hanbin otherwise nobody will care they need someone who will bring variety even if its new, even gp of korea agree that rickys visuals are outstanding they should let ppl see his shy personality , i dont think matthew stands out or is that funny is english, basically anything to get their name out to gp</p>

      <p>They need a member who is willing to sacrifice themself for variety purposes, kinda like a Jin, Sejeong, Seunghee, Bomi, Seungkwan, they will win over the Gp no matter how nugu 
The issue lies in who wants to do itðŸ˜‚ Hanbin too stiff, Matthew lack of fluency still gets him down but he can be the token foreigner only if he sacrifices himself (i dont think hes naturally funny tho) , Gyuvin kinda bc thats supposed to be his role as the personality hire but he might rub ppl off the wrong way, Gunwook possibly I think he fits fixed cast vibes, Taerae again not really funny but if desperately needed he could help, Ricky yes heâ€™s funny and cute sorry I have big plans for him he will be a star, everyone elae nah</p>

      <p>i think like the names anon mentioned are all on a certain degree of self aware to be able to sacrifice themselves as the comic relief of the group and i do think the closest to that is gunwook. idk how to explain it but i feel like gyuvin is too inside of his head to be able to do so</p>

      <p>gyuvin is naturally a comedic relief but he's stuck in being the lovey boy of the group

      <p>tbh Gyuvin would probably benefit from being in his head a little more. Not up in his feelings wallowing but actually thinking before speaking or doing things. Him being so in-the-moment and changeable is part of what makes him chaotic and funny in a ZB1 setting, but that kinda gag character isn't the most reliable for variety shows and his self-sacrificing potential is very dependent on established chemistry and familiar environment. The comic relief who goes beyond the group has to be smart and self-aware (like anon said) so as to maintain their dignity, as well as discerning of social boundaries so they know which to break for humor and which to heed for respect.</p>

      <p>I feel like he's not super confident w his comedic relief role tho like he wants to be taken seriously like he's a pretty serious guy he's just a bit dumb (no offense) that's why I also think Gunwook should be the variety member if Ricky was Korean he'd be perfect too cause of the difference between his image and personality</p>

      <p>He wants to be taken serious but he acts like that? I think he doesn't act like it on purpose or tries to turn environments and he thinks of himself as more serious than he actually is yea riwook suit it way better than him
