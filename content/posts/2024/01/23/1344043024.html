      <p>bruh i just saw a tweet notification i got from zb1's twitter and it says "zerobaseone is on the cover of [spotify playlist]" but the pic is just of zhang hao (and like yeah his name and ost title is in the hashtags of the tweet but still) maybe i'm overthinking it bc i'm traumatised from the past week's events but why do i feel like we're gonna have another bout of war from akgaes LORD SEND THE FUCKING FLOOD</p>

      <p>additionally with the mattrae/hao fansign thing idk if ppl realised this but i'm pretty sure one of the fansigns hao was absent from was one that was already rescheduled from when mattrae had covid and that was moved so idk if they would've been able to move the fansign AGAIN. the other fansigns were like consecutively after or surrounding that so it would've been odd to have those fansigns, then a gap and THEN the re-rescheduled fansign if what i said even makes sense. idk if i'm thinking too highly of wk1 bc despite all this they genuinely are so shit tier but that's what made sense to me at the time. they should've had like some hao representation in ALL the ot8 pics tho since groups do that all the time and it only happened in one of them</p>

      <p>I think they could've tried harder to acknowledge haos absence but there was definitely reasonings behind the cancellings and stuff this company is rlly not shit and I hate it but also not everything is a secret death sabotage ploy üò≠
