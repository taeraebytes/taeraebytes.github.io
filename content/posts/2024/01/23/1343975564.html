 I know people are shocked that we didn’t chart 1 on bugs and tbh we should have been really high but we also need to remember that exo had a cb the same day of our debut and jungkook dropped a song 1 day before crush. So quite literally the odds were against our favour on all charts. I hope this wakes zerose up for the next cb though because it’s not hard to top bugs and we can do it easily as long as we don’t get screwed over with having a cb In between digimons</p>
