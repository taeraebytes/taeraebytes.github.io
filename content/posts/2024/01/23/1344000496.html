      <p>have u seen those clips of hb's dms and gw's calls with their ssgs? it's so creepily weird
zeroses keep talking about how they want ssgs gone from the fandom when the members themselves are the ones enabling them</p>

      <p>I mean you can't rlly say they kick it with ssgs and when you consider their positions and who the ssgs are plus the fact there's no protection it's kind of sad they're not enabling and there's no proof of direct contact how is it their fault they get gang stalkedðŸ˜­
