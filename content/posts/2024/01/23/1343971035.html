      <p>he might be bi but doesn’t think he could date a woman or be happy with a woman for the rest of his life or he could’ve realized he’s just gay after dating his ex gf</p>

      <p>that doesn’t automatically make u bi tho. i said he may have thought he was bi and then after dating a bunch of women maybe requestioned whether he was actually attracted t them. bc a bi guy wouldn’t write off marriage like that bc they still see a possibility of them falling in love w a woman. so it makes sense if he’s realized that maybe he doesn’t like woman hence why he told his parents he wouldn’t get married to one</p>
