      <p>PERIOD ANON. the way entirety of zerose twt was jumping every single rosin and saying they were being dramatic and annoying. remember how  they made him sign hundreds of albums all by himself while he was sick, that freaking stupid 10min show they uploaded just on wb to calm c-rosins down... ugh they really treated him like shit in debut era wow.</p>
