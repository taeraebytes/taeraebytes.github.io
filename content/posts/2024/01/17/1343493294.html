      <p>I dont know if ud agree with me but at this point (im not rosin) i wouldnt care and would even be glad if hao bar / hanbin /zerocola bar started boycotting .. wakeone need to fucking wake up theyre too greedy with these sales but cant use anything efficiently , i know its like a last resort and we shouldnt wish this for a rookie group but they are taking it too far - im not showing bias cause even if it happened to anyone else id say the same , but ignoring a large company email UNTIL they took matters in their own hands is shocking behavior they are defo fucking lazy and they need to be put in their place</p>

      <p>I talked about this to oomf last night a boycott would drastically change things but I understand why again they're afraid of carrying a full blown one out because there's no promise wakeone will tighten up
