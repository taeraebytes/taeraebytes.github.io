      <p>you're trynna start a war but I think these people actually have memory loss nobody ever dragged hanbin for any gigs he got just the company because it was unfair promotion + the fact that these people have quite literally bullied the members and all their fans so idk what there is to cry ab now or why they care since they hate everyone so much and now they're talking ab career sabotage..... if things continued how they started THAT is career sabotage

      <p>Wouldn’t defend usually but there were definitely people who lost the plot and were just attacking hanbin + his family</p>

      <p>That's true but I'm not even joking when I say they use me as the poster board of people who "lashed out" on hanbin for aaa announcement when all I said was that it's weird that there's a theme of survival centers mcing there were def people going crazy but the majority were not
