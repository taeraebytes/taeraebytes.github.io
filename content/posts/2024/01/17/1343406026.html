      <p>you're trynna start a war but I think these people actually have memory loss nobody ever dragged hanbin for any gigs he got just the company because it was unfair promotion + the fact that these people have quite literally bullied the members and all their fans so idk what there is to cry ab now or why they care since they hate everyone so much and now they're talking ab career sabotage..... if things continued how they started THAT is career sabotage
