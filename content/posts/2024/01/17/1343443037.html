      <p>wdbz is just such a hella masc hiphop dance group and we‚Äôre working with a bunch of twinks here üò≠ wakeone needs to understand the member‚Äôs dancing styles and also listen to their damn music (because they‚Äôre making pretty boy music) and choose choreographers accordingly</p>

      <p>cyj did evnne's choreo bc park hanbin is his fav (even told him that he should come to him if he doesn't debut during boys planet), sung hanbin should've been stricter during the say my name practice sessions if he wanted zb1 to have better choreo</p>
