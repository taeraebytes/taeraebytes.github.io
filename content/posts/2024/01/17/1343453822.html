      <p>Downplaying what wonyoungs been through is insane because hanbin will never feel the brunt and pure nastiness of the industry towards a successful woman, these people at this point are looking for hanbin to be hated they're pushing a narrative that everyone is against him when it's not true. Just take one look at this group and it's history and realize more than one member has been HATED for long periods of time what annoys me is that this group of people point fingers at everyone else and erase history that they were also a part of. To paint these issues as something thats exclusive to one member seriously just downplays the extreme pain and trauma literally everyone else has gone through. I normally wouldn't say anything because yes you're allowed to be upset and speak up about what hanbins going through he shouldn't have to but that's not what they're doing here they're accusing people of things they've never done focusing on childish twitter arguments and almost glamorizing things like what is the point of comparing hanbins antis to others??? Why are they focusing his issues in other places. Like this is actually making me so heated it's the very same people who participate in other members bullying as well because who are you to point fingers and get angry at what other people say that's literally your gameplay. And this isn't all of his fans a lot are being productive but a large group of very loud and vile people are leading things and painting this picture that the group and the fandom hates hanbin it almost sounds like they want it to be true who just continuously repeats these delusions if they don't believe them. But I digress you can never change or reason with these people.
