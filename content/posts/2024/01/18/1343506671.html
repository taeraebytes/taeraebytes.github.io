      <p>as someone who was on that train sis I can't tell you it snowballed really fast it's so very easy to hate someone in a survival show setting so you know we all got too lit and just started going crazy it's not even his visuals everyone used to think he was cute before the articles came out it's just that he got the short end of the stick and people decided to expose him and shit was up

      <p>Sorry long cc incoming i get what y'all are saying and i do think hao had it the worst with the whole outing thing and the matt hate train was BAD but i think u guys also underestimate the pressure on hanbin

Not to generalize cfans but a lot of hate campaigns start from places like weibo and douban.  you can chalk it up to 'oh theyre just trolls' but trolls are still harmful. The post painting him as a bad leader for not introducing the group before his speech at their first award show got like 25k likes (idk if they were bought or what but the point is, it still had reach) and it IS weird how he avoided doing speeches until like the last 2 or 3 award shows after that happened.
antis also take advantage of ot9 zeroses' concerns, the whole instagram comment thing spiraled because it started as ppl being rightfully upset at wakeone but those with a vendetta against him decided oh yeah lets blame hanbin specifically. The first trucks were also initially funded by ot9 zeroses who were scammed. 
Also being a leader of a group like zb1 is just not easy he gets blamed for so much shit he has no control over and taking care of these manchildren is probably draining even if he likes the members
Im not even gonna mention the whole mom and sister had to restrict and delete comments cus of harassment i think thats self explanatory  and the hate comments on mnet plus too, and the fatphobia and homophobia over his past videos
+ rosins are genuinely convinced that Song manager woman is behind every single thing that he gets and that she has a lot of power which is just lol.
What worries me most is the fact that Hanbin is learning  chinese and is probably curious about what they say ab him on sns. It's not hard to find hate comments too, hell just look at his post on the official zb1 weibo account on crush release day, the top comments are all hateðŸ˜­

I cant really blame people for not caring though because allindans are fucking schizo specially iallins and callins so they really did it to themselves but im still concerned about him lol. And this is not to say he'll ever suffer as much as a female idol or as a chinese idol after all hes a korean man in the kpop industry but the hate very much is there and is worse than you think.</p>

      <p>No I wholeheartedly get you and I agree when I say these things they're never in response to the general issue usually it's people sending me stuff about obvious akgaes and even the said akgaes dragging me into their business so everything I say is an attempt to put things into retrospect for these low iq bastards but they're not smart nor do they listen. I agree with all the points you made I'm concerned ab him as well and I hope in some future things get better but I'm usually not talking ab that cuz I like to think there's a consensus between me and anons that were talking ab a specific group of people and we understand issues
