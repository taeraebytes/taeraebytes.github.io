      <p>how does jiwoong give centre i'm cryingjfdngjvsndfs but FR when i watched the crush performance for the first time during the comeback live, so before crush mv had even been released, my first thought was "oh there's gonna be lots of discourse about this" but then i saw basically nothing????? maybe i just curated my tl well enough but usually things slip through the cracks if i come to a forum-like cc such as this. but yeah yujin was def giving centre like being in the middle at the start AND the end? kinda crazy but whatever i'm surprised there weren't trucks</p>
