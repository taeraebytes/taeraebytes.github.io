      <p>because taking legal action would cause them to loose money and need some effort and all they care about is profit, hanbin is not the only one who had very vile shit happend to him during the zb1 active time as much as you allins want to believe it, and they never did shit for anyone, while in the case with the hao situation they were publicly ridiculed for ignoring a high profile mag which is super shitty for their reputation which could lead to other agencies not wanting to work with them = no money + allowing them to post about him wouldnâ€™t make them lose money or need any effort, they literally only had to give an ok which is the easiest damage control ever</p>
