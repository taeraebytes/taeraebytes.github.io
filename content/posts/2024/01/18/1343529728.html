      <p>WDYM dont think its bad??? touching is prohibited for a reason cause these bitches are CRAZYYY 😭😭😭 Every single one them who attend fansigns are batshit crazy to begin with. No offense. Unless u got in by luck but otherwise u crazy.

From my few minutes of researching since ricky isnt my bias
1- I think they've been his fs since bp yet they still straight up lied to his face in order to touch him
2- I think shes a sasaeng who follows him on flights, i checked her profile and u clearly see pics of him past customs so im assuming she takes the same flight as him/ zb1
3-Those leaked msgs of her fantasizing about him sexually, even pre debut ones when hes underage, how looking at him makes her horny so she has to go take a shower like WTFF???? So it's safe to assume the entire time she was his fs she wanted to touch him.
4- She's so desperate, obsessed and delusional for touch that she could on longer hold it in and finally made a move IN THE REAL WORLD, no longer fantasizing about it in her head. That's fucking crazyyyy cause It starts with fantasizing, then a high five and then she'll want more and more and more. PHYSCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
5- if this was gender swapped yall be taking it seriously lets be honest

Anywyas, this reminds me of those serial killer crime docs and how ppl become serial killers, starts with fantasizing, then they want to feel it so they start with small animals and then humans. Get this physco away from Ricky NOWWWWW</p>

      <p>well yes it would be worse if it's gender swapped and I think anon just means the action cuz isolated it doesn't look that bad but when you look at all the facts it's bad
