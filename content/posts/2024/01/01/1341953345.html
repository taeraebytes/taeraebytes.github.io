      <p>i don’t think they’re debuting in 2024 bc nct tokyo and smngg are gonna debut but also it’s so stupid why r they throwing out groups left and right when they’re known for neglecting their old groups once they debut new ones like let riize have their moment for a few years</p>

      <p>Nct new team debuted already and yea they're gonna do the gg for sure in 2024 but they're releasing the bg trainees rn which is weird I think they might actually be sticking with their riize global plan
