      <p>i donâ€™t think theyâ€™re debuting in 2024 bc nct tokyo and smngg are gonna debut but also itâ€™s so stupid why r they throwing out groups left and right when theyâ€™re known for neglecting their old groups once they debut new ones like let riize have their moment for a few years</p>

      <p>Nct new team debuted already and yea they're gonna do the gg for sure in 2024 but they're releasing the bg trainees rn which is weird I think they might actually be sticking with their riize global plan

      <p>iâ€™m glad riize is doing the global thing cuz anton is literally the first english idol to adress his global fans so sincerely. like most idols either ignore their ifans, or just use them for jokes. but he wrote this whole ass essay for us for new years and NOTHING FOR THE KFANS. and ugh heâ€™s so eloquent and mature for someone so young i recommend reading the letter he sent (cuz u like anton right). iâ€™m so glad he debuted like that is nepo baby done right !!! also he is taking it jn terms of idols w the best music taste like itâ€™s just hit after hit he hasnâ€™t missed once</p>
