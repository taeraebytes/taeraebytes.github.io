      <p>ok but since dispatch released an exclusive article like two days ago defending that actor, i am guessing that our of respect they won't be releasing a couple this year</p>

      <p>back in 2022 dispatch announced a concert with a bunch of big groups like bts twice svt etc etc on new year's.

technically it was for their 10th anniversary but it was sus because most of those groups had stopped attending other big award shows but were participating in a joint concert for dispatch. so knetz started calling it hostage concert because they were probably performing for them to keep their relationships hush hush</p>
