    "reply": "tbz? Girl u just made that up riize have a retroish concept and work with black choreographers constantly and shotaro has a deep history in dancing in hiphop. for shotaros dance break it wasn't even exclusively hiphop centered and he's also just very very talented. Zb1 don't have an in-house choreographer or a dance teacher but they've worked with a black choreographer for crush I think? Also matthew has a little background and everyone points out that he has a groovier style which is perfectly suited for hiphop he is smooth too. And bts???? Jfnrngjmdkkdkdnd I mean it's obvious when they dance to black choreo but all they have is Jhope ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
