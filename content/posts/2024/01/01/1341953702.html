      <p>i don’t think they’re debuting in 2024 bc nct tokyo and smngg are gonna debut but also it’s so stupid why r they throwing out groups left and right when they’re known for neglecting their old groups once they debut new ones like let riize have their moment for a few years</p>

      <p>Nct new team debuted already and yea they're gonna do the gg for sure in 2024 but they're releasing the bg trainees rn which is weird I think they might actually be sticking with their riize global plan

      <p>They wanna go down the hybe route with the mass group production they're actually saturating the industry with so many groups from the same companies mid size companies are about to face a terrible fate
