      <p>omg idk if it's because of the choreos zb1 do but i don't see any single member in zb1 as a GREAT hiphop dancer ðŸ˜­ like yeah whatever hb is a pro but when i watch other groups like riize or tbz or even bts like idk how to describe it their main dancers are so fluid and smooth like shotaro's dance break in GaG was mind blowing idt anyone in zb1 will be able to pull it off.</p>

      <p>tbz? Girl u just made that up riize have a retroish concept and work with black choreographers constantly and shotaro has a deep history in dancing in hiphop. for shotaros dance break it wasn't even exclusively hiphop centered and he's also just very very talented. Zb1 don't have an in-house choreographer or a dance teacher but they've worked with a black choreographer for crush I think? Also matthew has a little background and everyone points out that he has a groovier style which is perfectly suited for hiphop he is smooth too. And bts???? Jfnrngjmdkkdkdnd I mean it's obvious when they dance to black choreo but all they have is Jhope ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
