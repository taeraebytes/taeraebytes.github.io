      <p>these crazy ladies always make up schizophrenic stories and they just guessed this duo off interactions and guesses and they snooped and stalked real hard and found yunjins spotify the one that got exposed with the playlists(?) (I honestly forgot whatever it was that was found but it wasn't smth stupid I could believe it) she had with yeonjun and then it made its way to the kside they make up a bunch of shit there but they actually made their first guess that had some tact
