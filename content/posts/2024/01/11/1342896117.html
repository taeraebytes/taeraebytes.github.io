      <p>hao said in a fancall back in like september that he liked soobin bc he watched a hybe variety show and soobin stood out to him, my friend who is an ex moa said that the show was about dancing to random kpop songs and soobin won by knowing all gg dances so it makes sense hao would like him, and that friend also said that soobin mentioned wanting to make more idol friends and he would reach out to people first, so he might’ve heard about hao mentioning him and contacted him? i think he’s also friends with chenle and so is hao, also hao said during a live in like oct-nov that he was texting with soobin</p>
