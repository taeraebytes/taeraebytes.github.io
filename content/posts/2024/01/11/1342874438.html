      <p>no they aren’t ? maybe some hanbin solo turned briize are but the majority of briize didn’t stan hanbin/zb1 a lot of them were excited abt the mcs bc jaehyun and hanbin are kinda the most known of their groups and are generally well liked. like i like a few members of zb1 (not hanbin) but im not a solo nor do i stan i jus think they’re cute</p>

      <p>There is undeniably a HUGE chunk that are and I wouldn't call some solos they just only pay attention to hanbin but on briizetwt besides the sm rookie fans a lot rlly are ex zeroses at least the most annoying ones are but both fandoms are pretty happy so idgy fighting would occur
