      <p>A little bit TMI but a year ago I went to Korea for the first time I always regret not going to a lot of kpop related things but I did apply for artist battle boys planet and got in, at the time I didn't really have a fave but I came out as a Ricky fan from over me ðŸ˜­ But honestly that was one of the worst days of my life, I had no idea we had to wait for 6 hours with no food and drink the hottest venue possible, no phones but the whole process was so interesting. Btw everything is really structured I've never been to a live audience so I didn't know, but they tell you when to scream when the mc comes in and the waits between the groups were sooo long! Anyways I can give you some review if you want but I don't want to type too long but I love ur cc haha</p>

      <p>I was staying with friends that study there and I did a mini course for Korean i paid for until the summer, but pretty much I went there by myself its costly as fuck so get ready for that but its pretty safe for women, still i dont go places alone so be careful .And i didnt go to those scatty clubs lmao they spread STIâ€™s . Honestly the shorter your stay the better  you can do everything you want in a week , get some treatments while ur there . and Jejudo is overrated

Tbh i dont know much tea to say the performances are what you get on youtube , they did Say my name more than once because they wanted us to do the name chant with them at the end , which i looked around to my friend and said isnt that riggingðŸ˜­ But idk maybe they usually do more than one


I remember they told us to be quiet when putting in our votes and they repeated it in english on purpose , but a international fan screamed vote for Jay and she got the dirtest looks everðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I dont think the Korean fans fucked with him it was really Zhanghao Sunghanbin central

Everyone went in with a smily excited face and by the end its like 12-1 everyone is over it , I actually waited for my friend for much longer cause they wanted to a do a survey and everyone is rushing to get to the bathrooms and last trains lmao .  

I went to some other events like I applied through a nugu gg CSR by buying their album joining fanclub, so i got music show acess for a week, so I saw Over me team at Mcountdown too (it was fixed numbers but if theres enough space they let you come in and fill it up) , Ricky officially stole my heart I was jealous though cause all the ones who applied though BP went to a fanmeeting so luckyðŸ˜­ also Kepler , Nmixx . It was IVE cb day but only their fanclub was allowed sadly, I saw them encore though . Thats it for kpop I just went to a bunch of concerts in the nosebleeds but thats all</p>
