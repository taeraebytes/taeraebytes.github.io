    "question": "some people won't like this but zb1 refuses to listen to staff on live it probably stresses them the fuck out lmfao. yeah it'd be great if they didn't need staff breathing down their neck but they'll get dragged if they say the wrong thing and a lot of them don't think before they speak. staff are there for the benefit of the group 95% of the time regardless of what some fans want to say",
    "reply": "They really are just some bad ass kids I feel like it's a mix fans are always going to villainize staff like to such an extent it kills me yea a lot of the times. But I do think they're also just pretty unfair to them at times someone said there was a live (group) they were asking to stay on longer but yea staff are there for the group and to do their jobs"
