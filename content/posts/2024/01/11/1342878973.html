      <p>they respect riize more (sm + them kinda becoming koreaâ€™s sons) also nobody is keeping tabs on zb1s wins except the fandom they prob didnâ€™t even know they won the rookie grand slam</p>

      <p>I wouldn't say no one is keeping tabs I get that riize have the gp and great promo but zb1s fandom isn't even that huge and strong for u to claim they're in a bubble they're being acknowledged ðŸ˜­

      <p>iâ€™m ngl iâ€™m a little confused whether ur agreeing w me or not ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

i meant that the industry treats riize w greater respect bc theyâ€™ve been everywhere on the news + theyâ€™re under a well known company while the same sentiment isnâ€™t given towards zb1 bc theyâ€™re under a midsize company (the group is also made up of trainees from nugu/mid companies). but iâ€™ve literally only seen zeroses talk abt the rookie grand slam the only awards ppl in general care abt are daesangs so i donâ€™t think the ppl working the ccmas were like omg zb1 just completed their rookie grand slam letâ€™s let them talk for a few extra minutes</p>
