      <p>Oh sm def does fact check going #1 immediately on two charts shouldve told y'all that cuz it fell off bad but they def do a little chart manipulation w riize it's customary but also it rlly has blown up so who knows I think for the most part gag and their new song are organic on the charts but talk saxy staying afloat makes zero sense seeing as it never charted well and it got ignored by kfans and they don't have a fandom strong enough to stream they're running off gp
