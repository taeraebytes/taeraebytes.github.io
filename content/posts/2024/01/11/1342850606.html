      <p>A little bit TMI but a year ago I went to Korea for the first time I always regret not going to a lot of kpop related things but I did apply for artist battle boys planet and got in, at the time I didn't really have a fave but I came out as a Ricky fan from over me ðŸ˜­ But honestly that was one of the worst days of my life, I had no idea we had to wait for 6 hours with no food and drink the hottest venue possible, no phones but the whole process was so interesting. Btw everything is really structured I've never been to a live audience so I didn't know, but they tell you when to scream when the mc comes in and the waits between the groups were sooo long! Anyways I can give you some review if you want but I don't want to type too long but I love ur cc haha</p>

      <p>It wasn't difficult but from the other foreigners I saw or applied with they all got contacted in different ways , some needed a kind of visa others didnt so it was kinda messy , on the day they were recording me in the line I was kinda scared I'd be on tv without consent lol 

Most of the foreigners were actually Hui stans I saw a bunch of them , I still have like 50 pieces of merch from every fan projects  , Also idk if anyone else was in Seoul in the time but hongdae cafes especially were overrun with bp events, I walked past Ma Jingxiang at his fan cafe before , I didn't see any fan sites but I heard loads of clicking for popular members 

When it was time to vote a lot of the fans there voting buttons weren't working for the first performance en garde so it took an extra hour to redistribute the voting machine things, I was already tired from the start lol

Now as a zerose I wish I remembered more of the stages but I do know the microphones are much more live in person and you don't really hear the music , everyone laughed when switch came out at first cause of the outfits , 

gunwook was an amazing performer, Haruto was crying for so long after performance cause of Supercharger team issues and it dramatically affected his votes lmao

After the first few stages I remember needing to pee so bad I couldn't concentrate , then Say my name came out and everyone suddenly was hyped tf upðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€But I'm not a cute concept enthusiast so I was just like okayðŸ˜‘ Over me was more strong in person because of the lights 

Anyways it was a interesting experience I'd rate it 7/10 I'd do it again now I just want to visit for zb1 first concert, hope u enjoyed reading lol I needed somewhere to dump this info</p>

      <p>Lmao they were about to get you in a promo video 

BUT WAS MJX MORE BEAUTIFUL IRL ugh I wish I could see him my babyyyy

Oh damn so you could really hear them over the music ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I didn't realize how drastic filming could get I was shocked when I heard that the bp auditions went on for almost 24 hrs goddamnnnn 

Oh so haruto really might've won instead of a tie but I have a question did you guys like see what we saw like the episode flashbacks or just the performances?

Yea me too I wasn't really eating smn but I could tell the crowd was and no wonder fans were acting like over me was pure sex ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

this was rlly fun to read thank u for the anecdote
