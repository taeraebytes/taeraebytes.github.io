      <p>So gunwook said taerae was one of the first people who said happy birthday to him (along with yujin) and he was also one of the people that mentioned gunwook's birthday on bubble, i think they're getting closer with each other

Also the maknaez are definitely waaaaaay closer than they are in front of cameras because yujin doesn't look like the type to wish someone happy birthday at midnight (i expected gyuvin to do such things) yet he did it to gunwook. They're adorable i love them so much</p>
