      <p>The thing is Rickys one is more natural, like he just looks like he was naturally born like that and in a way it complements the look he seems to be going for which is the manhwa character with pointed v chin . But hao it just looks off and sudden i need him to never get his face touched again</p>

      <p>No sis Ricky's used to scare me he had a long face to begin with and it genuinely elongated his face is such a way ugh I'm glad it's a lot better he's looking good alr. And it was not just me all my riyangi friends hated it he naturally doesn't have a very sharp strong chin of you look at pics of him in may his chin was pretty soft
