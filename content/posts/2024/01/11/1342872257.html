      <p>But riyangis are looking for it now they involve themselves in everything all their tweets have #that fandom like their ego is bigger than their love for ricky. See how even evil allins ask people to not involve in fanwars for hanbin sake</p>

      <p>it's not even riyangis talking most the time ricky is used as the pfp of multiple set up accs but they don't care. they tweeted about wanting to mass murder ricky fans because some casuals on instagram said a webtoon character looked like ricky. i guess the webtoon artist used hyunjin as an inspiration though so they're all foaming at the mouth because of it. best part is even some stays say it looks more like him than hyunjin but it truly is not that serious for them to be saying all that</p>

      <p>I think this is also the downside of him being like internet popular he has a lotttt of casuals and people who just know of him that use his pics but I didn't even know it was supposed to be hyunjin it looks nothing like him
