    "question": "as a briize i knew sm were faking the sales when it came out that gag sold one million copies ngl 😭 the fandom was tiny at debut like it was not possible however they aren’t doing chart manipulation at all. talk saxy was just badly received and the time between release and award show season they got more popular and they sampled an extremely popular song so it’s no surprise love 119 is performing well. honestly most kpop sales are fraudulent and not a measure of popularity idk why sm was just so blatantly dumb this time 🤦🏾‍♀️😭 but riize will be fine just wont believe their sales which nobody really cares about nowadays",
