maybe itâ€™s a preference thing but i donâ€™t think the concept fits the expression?</p>

      <p>diff anon but you need a certain type of visual. hanbin is too soft looking so when he does those expressions it looks awkward bc it doesnâ€™t suit his face and his vibes. I can see what heâ€™s going for I appreciate the effort but it just doesnâ€™t suit him but nobodyâ€™s gonna tell him that though ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I get what you mean it's funny he does these expressions cuz his face doesn't fit them at all I think that's why sticks out the most out of everyone who does it

      <p>True he definitely suits the brighter concepts, if you watch his melting point fancams his stage presence is so good in them</p>

      <p>Ik she's rightfully controversial but I loved everglow ups videos about stage presences and the different categories she created and yeah I think Hanbin learns from charismatic sensual performer but isn't one himself so it doesn't work, his strong point is def his smile</p>
