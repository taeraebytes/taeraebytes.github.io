      <p>okay I understand what's going on now. The Circle album chart for December was just published, not leaked and its sketchy af gonna send in two parts cus it wont let me send

SM said GAG sold 1,010,000 copies in their FIRST week (from September Circle Chart and SM statements so proud of themselves) but after a few months on the December Circle Chart,  the total sold was 1,030,000. So in 3-4 months they only sold 20k albums which is ridiculous AND the thing is they had over 60 fansigns from Sept to Jan 2024 and in order to GET INTO those fansigns you need to buy their single album and per fansign ppl buy between 100-2000+ albums just for a CHANCE to get in so the math is not mathing.</p>
