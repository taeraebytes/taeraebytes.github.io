      <p>P2

And just a FYI, they had no preorders so it's not like us where we can pre order an album, be entered into a draw and if chosen we can be entered into a fansign in the future and still counts towards first week sales. They had to buy the album when the fansigns were announced and I linked you the instiz of all the fansigns dates from Sept to Jan 2024. AND the reason why they had over 60 fansigns for GAG alone, not even talk saxy is because the 1 Mil they "sold" are stocks, so SM is trying to sell the stock by holding a lot of fansigns but they're still not able to sell their stock  ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€

Basically SM spends their own money to increase their stocks and say its their first week "sales" which is the 1.01 mil for GAG, to make headlines and break "records" for roty awards during award season. Then they'll try to sell the stock later to make back the money they spent on the stock by holding fansigns, 60+ fcking fansings lawwwwdd. Like they wouldn't be getting these roty awards if it weren't for the "stock". Hope that makes sense ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
