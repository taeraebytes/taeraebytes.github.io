      <p>idk if anyone else has noticed this since it’s in content no one gaf about but the cc about jiwoong getting married reminded me of it but i’ve noticed 2 times now that jiwoong has mentioned having experience living alone when doing some sort of domestic task and i find it so funny bc it’s like yeah reasonable but u also know it all like the back of ur hand bc ur CURRENTLY living alone idk i find it so funny, ur not fooling me! definitely the reason we’re never getting dorm content 😭😭😭</p>
