THIS IS SO FUNNNYY cuz atp we know all the numbers are fake af but on Saturday they only sold 400 (lbr this was probably the only real sales ðŸ˜‚) and then miraculously on Sunday that also happens to be the last day for 1st week sales they suddenly sold 200k+ just enough to make the '1st week 1 Million Seller' title ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

I wonder why SM is so insistent on having that title, I wonder who else has that title KADSFJIAEJIOAJFJKSDJKSD</p>
