      <p>Because they're dumb ugh like I'm sorry now is not the time. Not to mention they've been in this all for the group headspace for months when I went thru my fan depression in September they're all late as fuck but they still can't speak their minds this is why I barely associate with them. And that mono girl had the nerve to say gpds don't like me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
