      <p>No they probably wouldn't have ngl riize achieved some crazy feats so it makes sense they got some awards w zb1 bnd probablt wouldve still got fake awards

      <p>They give effortless fun I like their vibe I don't think anyone will copy seeing as how they're not getting recognition for it but I appreciate their concept

      <p>Effortless .. is not a word iâ€™d use to describe them ðŸ˜­ Dont get me wrong i like their debut songs but their sentimental pop-rock is just no with Serenade and But sometimes yes good music , but i feel like they havent got thst concept down and are trying too hard to be Block B without the talent : Like that Shut down performance was horrendous and genuinely they have no good singers they can only hold notes, nobody cares aboht anyone that isnt Jaehyun .</p>

      <p>When I mean effortless fun like they're fun and also their music isn't serious music idk shit about these boys out side of one and only and but sometimes if they continue down that road they could be a little smth
