THIS IS SO FUNNNYY cuz atp we know all the numbers are fake af but on Saturday they only sold 400 (lbr this was probably the only real sales 😂) and then miraculously on Sunday that also happens to be the last day for 1st week sales they suddenly sold 200k+ just enough to make the '1st week 1 Million Seller' title 🤣🤣🤣😭💀💀

I wonder why SM is so insistent on having that title, I wonder who else has that title KADSFJIAEJIOAJFJKSDJKSD</p>

      <p>No but the funny thing, if I understood correctly that the reason why they're still doing fansigns for get a guitar is because they still haven't sold the 1 million stock? Their most recent one was Jan 5th, I can't this is so too funny like I can't believe it is real. 

But yeah I think the award they got for mama was specifically for breaking the 1 millions sales and it seems like they still haven't sold 1 million yet and it's Jan, MAMA was in November 🥶</p>
