      <p>they respect riize more (sm + them kinda becoming koreaâ€™s sons) also nobody is keeping tabs on zb1s wins except the fandom they prob didnâ€™t even know they won the rookie grand slam</p>

      <p>I wouldn't say no one is keeping tabs I get that riize have the gp and great promo but zb1s fandom isn't even that huge and strong for u to claim they're in a bubble they're being acknowledged ðŸ˜­
