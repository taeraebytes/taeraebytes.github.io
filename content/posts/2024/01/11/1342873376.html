      <p>unrelated to pannchoa but Ricky trending on theqoo is CRAZYYYY cuz they're sinophobic af and rarely anyone thats not big4 trends. I lurked just now and the comments are all positive which again is crazyyyy. Also saw someone tweet he's also trending on fmkorea right now, fm fcking korea. A male forum known known to shit talk idols especially males but theyre all saying hes handsome and like how dedicated he is to his style. 

idc even if hes not my bias I'm so happy to see members trend especially with so much positive engagement cause I'm so used to us trending either for something negative or we trend for something positive but the comments are shitting on us. pls gawd may their 3rd comeback chart and RISEEEEEEEEEEEE 🙏🙏🙏🙏</p>
