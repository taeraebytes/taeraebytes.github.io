      <p>this tweet is extremely dumbbjjhg this is how i know zeroses just like to yap for the sake of hit tweets whenever shit goes down cause wdym they dont wanna work with them bc of the fandom do they not know the first thing about businesjdhuej apart from the trucks being damaging to a rookie group's reputation i agree, you really think they're gonna look at sf and akgae wars on fuckass twitter and go yeah fuck the profit i dont wanna deal with this fandom  😭😭😭 😭😭😭 and for the most part brand deals and magazine deals are pulled by strings = company connections and wakeone is extremely useless when it comes to this so. let's just put the thinkpieces to rest lmfao</p>

      <p>girl the fandom wars are obviously not staying on twitter, when trucks are being send 😂 eb is seeing that shit, reporters are writing articles about it too. ITS EMBARASSING 😮‍💨😮‍💨 thats how i know you are new to this kpop shit. zb1 is probably on the way of being known as the group with the crazy fans, if they arent already.</p>

      <p>From a non fan perspective it's just the trucks and then articles ab the trucks but again the article game in korea is nothing like in American it's not gonna go crazy it's embarrassing yes but people who aren't fans seriously do not care nor will they care after a day or two so yea this isn't affecting their connections lmaooooo
