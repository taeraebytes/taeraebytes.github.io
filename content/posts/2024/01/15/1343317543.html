      <p>like they need to tune in right now to bl manhwas! i’ve been into bl since for a decade and let me tell you japanese mangas were the only popular genre of bl then but korean manhwas pretty much took over and are the only popular reading media now because the japanese fell off with their manga plots. also despite thai dramas becoming  massive during the beginning of the 2020s I still think it’s shit quality most of the time but I rec anon to watch (i told sunset about you, last twilight and my school president)</p>
