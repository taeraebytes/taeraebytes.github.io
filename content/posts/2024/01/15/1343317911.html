      <p>diff anon but dont u find it strange that in the beginning haobin were literally attached at the hip and were so disgustingly in love (no joke im not even a shipper but i couldnt even watch some of their earlier content bc the way they interact w eo seems so intimate??? especially in that kcon japan behind and taerae show japan, i felt like i was third wheeling LMAO) not much of hao but more to hanbin especially mentioning that other half of my soul shit, and that one interview where he was yapping about hao for 5 paragraphs and answering the actual question on the last 2 and then 2 months pass and they barely interact on camera anymore</p>

      <p>Yea it's really declined but I think it's for the better because they didn't have identities outside of the ship because of how huge it got people could not treat them as their own separate people now they have that even with the ship still being huge now they just gotta throw in more bait 🙏

      <p>ok but the way they interacted almost made me shipper 😭 and now we are back to basic yaoi bait with all members (thank god at least gyubrick died) which i find kinda distasteful, they say smth like  “omg what if they find out about our relationship 🫢” and people go still crazy, at least put in some effort in it 😒</p>
