      <p>and then allins making excuses y hb doesnt trend on other forums that are actually relevant and used by the gp like theqoo saying nobody trends if it aint big 4 but ricky did with multiple posts in one week with 100k views each + positive responseğŸ™Š ++ hes a foreignerğŸ˜­ +++ hes chinese ğŸ’€ (not saying chinese is bad just saying i know theyre extremely sinphobic there so when i saw ricky and theqoo i was scared to click cause i thought it was a hate post ngl but was surprised with the positive response)

I wonder what excuse theyll use prob 'its a one time thing nothing special he still aint top10 most search on instiz' ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ if ricky is the one thatll shut these annoying ass allins up and give them a reality check then i dont mind it</p>
