      <p>she doesn't work with CJ either, that's studio gl1de director and idk if she even has that much time to be managing both studio gl1de and also be zb1 manager since studio gl1de was casting trainees is it even confirmed that she's the head manager?</p>

      <p>people are saying she's the female manager from all their videos but again this is all alleged. And everyone's been saying she's a head manager so idk I checked her ig and she seems to be posting about a lot of their schedules and keeps up with hanbin and it doesn't look like she manages anyone else but yea

      <p>yeah i really don't think it's as bad as everyone is making it seem like a good portion of the members have staff from their own company working with them (well, at least yuehuaz and hanbin which is more than half the group lmao). i think i sent a cc with similar sentiment here before but it wasn't posted (or maybe it was in lotus' now that i think about it, but whatever) but like don't hanbin's gigs make sense? like he's the most popular member in korea and helps get zb1's name out, plus he's well spoken so being mc for mcd, other events as well as a panel guest that one dating show episode so that makes sense. the fashion gig sorta makes sense too idk, yujin, hao and jiwoong have all gone to events like that now and hao and ricky are speculated to have fashion partnerships of their own. it's like riize payola, it's MAYBE there but it also doesn't look that sus TO ME idk</p>

      <p>Yea they do make sense though I will say it's not like his popularity difference is at the scale people make it out to be so it's like they're all rookies it shouldn't be just one person getting the name out for the group when there's other extremely popular members and members with potential to get popular. Things have defffff changed though like people are making it seem like it's in bloom again but no i feel like riize payola is smarter like they push members in a smart way and members that suit things the most rather than just the most popular at every single thing

      <p>I feel like if in bloom didn't start out as such a shit era we wouldn't be here the dance break stuff came after but if it was a group focus wow we might've still be royalty

      <p>tbh wakeone should've focus on group instead of giving them solo gigs especially when theyre still rookies. group like bts and svt are successful and have strong fandoms bc their companies push the whole group so the fans are more united. zb1 coming from survival show make it worse</p>
