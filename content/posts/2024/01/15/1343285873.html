the fact that the truck demands are "change sns account admins", "fair RT", "fair behind", "fair upload" all it's about mistreatment, even it didn't mention hanbin, but allins saw this to drag hanbin? that's meant they don't want ot9 to protest with mistreatment since hanbin get gigs. are they stupid or insecure? altho the triggers could be anything, but the content is still about mistreatment, what's wrong with that?</p>

      <p>I don't think the message is wrong this whole thing just turned into a shit show wow but I feel like people aren't realizing it's not just that that's making people send trucks it's been something that's been talked ab for months but this was the dumbest thing to do it over I'm just sooo annoyed by this it's so dumb to me and all this infighting just take me out
