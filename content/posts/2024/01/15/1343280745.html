      <p>and then allins making excuses y hb doesnt trend on other forums that are actually relevant and used by the gp like theqoo saying nobody trends if it aint big 4 but ricky did with multiple posts in one week with 100k views each + positive responseðŸ™Š ++ hes a foreignerðŸ˜­ +++ hes chinese ðŸ’€ (not saying chinese is bad just saying i know theyre extremely sinphobic there so when i saw ricky and theqoo i was scared to click cause i thought it was a hate post ngl but was surprised with the positive response)

I wonder what excuse theyll use prob 'its a one time thing nothing special he still aint top10 most search on instiz' ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ if ricky is the one thatll shut these annoying ass allins up and give them a reality check then i dont mind it</p>

      <p>And didn't he get on fmkorea that was honestly super impressive and imo I prefer huge trending articles across sites where you aren't a regular over every week 1-3k engagements and top searches
