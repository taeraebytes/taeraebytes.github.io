      <p>this one acc who is a known hao anti on weibo brought up stuff from douban to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that it was crosins who did those stuff on ig and allindans on twitter are eating it up rn. douban is an anonymous forum usually full of gossips so ofc if we go by their logic of proving things this way, the teas about hanbin on douban are true too. one of the threads about him and his manager that has been going around which i think everyone even kzeroses know by now:
