      <p>idk if your bias is on zb1 but i hope you are done and are free from zb1 bc this happened to me with my zb1 bias around September and it lasted until November, but something shifted around December and I think I like him even more now and it's annoying bc i always said that I would unstan zb1 at least 6 months before disbandment so I wouldn't get hurt but now idk if it's possible</p>
