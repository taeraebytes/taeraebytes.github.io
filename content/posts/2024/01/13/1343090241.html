      <p>I've been telling you that he needs to go back to his black hair and keep it long until the fillers set into his face bc the lighter and shorter the hair, the less obvious the chin is. Same reason why Wonbin keeps his hair longer and longer despite his fans claiming that he should chop it.</p>
