      <p>reasonable rejection? bitch fuck you and worry about gunwook's irrelevant ass never getting any solo gigs cause no one's checking for him meanwhile wk1 keep restricting the most popular members for the sake of the other flops.</p>

      <p>Just to add but zb1 are rookies that aren’t even a year old what do you think it’s going to look like if they send out a member to China for a solo festival gig this early into their career. As someone whose ulted other C-idols I can say none of them have gone to promote back in China this early into their career</p>
