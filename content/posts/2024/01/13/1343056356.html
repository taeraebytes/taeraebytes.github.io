      <p>my bias is still included in the 6 and i would hate that group. gyuvin is a needed member people overlook having someone who can't sing but can dance decently then he gets 5 seconds of lines and fans can't talk shit. despite being lowk problematic he is funny and you can tell everyone loves him. taerae is there to balance vocals if it was all on hao and hanbin it would actually be haobin and friends with the amount of lines they already are getting. jiwoong reasoning is similar to gyuvin and even if i dislike him i am glad it's him and not jay because this fandom would be even messier and more cringe than it is now</p>
