      <p>has yujin done anything? i'd hope not due to his age, plus he looks pretty similar from the few predebut things i've seen. sometimes i look at his teeth and am like "are those veneers" bc they look kinda perfect but that may just be bc i'm traumatised by one of my ult groups getting a veneer groupon from their local orthodontist or whatever (bet it's totally hard to guess which group this is LMAOOOOOOOOO).. his nose also kinda makes me pause and maybe he got the typical eyelid work but i'm only saying these ones bc they're the usual kpop procedures. i hope he got nothing done even tho that's delusional üôè</p>

      <p>Lol not that interesting pretty much what you'd expect, she was in a mid sized company where a top gg is promoting rn she said they struggled to find boys and it was mostly girls, almost all Koreans with some japanese but it's more diverse for boys, in her experience she was friends w the trainees but it was really superficial, she said she was super depressed and insecure back then and that everyone had eds lol hmm what else the company gave socmed English Korean, japanese and styling lessons and they got professionals to style them and found out what colors, hair, etc fits them</p>
