      <p>reasonable rejection? bitch fuck you and worry about gunwook's irrelevant ass never getting any solo gigs cause no one's checking for him meanwhile wk1 keep restricting the most popular members for the sake of the other flops.</p>

      <p>Just to add but zb1 are rookies that aren’t even a year old what do you think it’s going to look like if they send out a member to China for a solo festival gig this early into their career. As someone whose ulted other C-idols I can say none of them have gone to promote back in China this early into their career</p>

      <p>we really dont give a shit this group is temporary and was created to hype the members for their future careers there's no "patience" when it comes to temporary groups and especially wakeone, and since zb1 are flops in china it could give them some good exposure too, why are yall defending the company sm over this lol ik damn well you'd never be saying this if it was your bias</p>

      <p>Ok you people are just not understanding why would I get mad at that even if it were for my bias sending someone to a solo music festival just makes 0 sense and you can't be so sure that he'd gain good exposure or be well received besides his fans

      <p>the group was not created for that so idk where you got the idea but it has never been for that. some post produce group idols have that happen for them but that is not why the group was created. the group was created to be a group and for wk1 to get money and so the other companies involved will have a head start when their idols come back to redebut by already having fans. they are two different things, so unlike what you want zb1 is not preparation for his solo career or next group. and i'm not asslicking this is just reality</p>
