      <p>as a gg stan i stan lit everyone from big to nugu, i havent seen a gg as â€˜male-gazeyâ€™ as triple s for a while, the ceo has said plenty of times he plans to put as much visuals in the group for guys to enjoy, they have this dorm reality set up recording them all the time, young ass members like its such a mess literally no female fans want to stan them in korea even though theres a lot of potential stan attractors,, all in all the ceo has given up on vocals theres about 3 or 4 passable singers in a group of 26 which is shameful</p>

      <p>bc kpop is not ready for that shit, people want to see seasoned idols or at least people with talent, they don't enjoy the akb48 part of including inexperienced people</p>

      <p>akb48 system is kinda clever if you think about it, they had elections each year where people bought albums to vote and rank members based on popularity and to determine the center for a single like if we think about it a lot of the things akb48 did were the blueprint for kpop</p>

      <p>during nct 2020 they got divided in like 4 groups iirc, they did a live on where they picked their name tags randomly to make those groups so basically the plan was that when the album got released the albums would have some code and with that code they could go to some page, enter the code and vote for which unit they liked the most and that unit would release a christmas carol, they would go on some trip and do a vlog, something about a pijama party,  a relay youtube vlog or something like that. but then the fans got mad as hell so sm backed up and they were like well just vote which activity do you want all the members to do and iirc the relay vlog won</p>
