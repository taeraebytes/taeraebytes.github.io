      <p>gp only listens to like 10 groups not even and they dgaf abt scandals or dating unless itâ€™s like rising sun level bad . but the kpop fans in korea r crazy so everyone generalizes. the only idols the gp prob even know/care abt are newjeans, wonyoung (maybe yujin sheâ€™s lowkey everywhere), jungkook, idk who else</p>

      <p>yea I feel like people forget in general kpop fans are a large chunk so when they're referring to gp they're also referring to just kpop fans the real gp could give a lesser fuck

      <p>There's a loot of idols that are known to the broader gp in Korea all of snsd all of exo maknae line of BTS at least Jennie all of twice etc etc but kpop has always been more fandom based and that's fine, idk what the obsession w the gp is I'm not sure if there's even a gp for western music nowadays it's all fandoms and niche (this we had Taylor swift midnight album topping and dominating the chart and jungkooks thing too but it's entirely fandom based and not gp like for ex Gaga's hit in the 2010s)</p>

      <p>these r western artists but like: olivia rodrigo, sabrina carpenter, frank ocean, troye sivan, doja, sza, dua lipa, the weeknd, etc.. a lot of these ppl do have crazy fans duh but 98% of their fans just like them for the music. w kpop itâ€™s just fan bases unless u casually just listen to the kpop genre as a whole which is still kinda niche or unless the artist releases an english song that gets radio play in the us</p>

      <p>Lots of people don't know but he and Omar Apollo used to date for a while and then frank broke his heart so Omar made a banger album where he basically stole franks whole sound so if you miss his music you can check it out</p>
