      <p>Actually group fancams are worse you can immediately tell when a member loses energy or messes up and it fucks up with the synchronisation , i liked the recent ccma performance but watching the group fancam changed my thoughts just a bit , taerae hunny i know ur trying your best but he really reduces the dance skill of the group to level 0 he just cannot dance ,, everyone else was v good actually but yujin loses energy halfway and stops caring lmao , gyuvin has had great improvement i must say</p>
