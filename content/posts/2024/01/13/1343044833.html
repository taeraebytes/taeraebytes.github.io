      <p>Ok today y'all are killing me actually it's too much😭 I think daily at least 30-40ish people I can tell sometimes when the same anon is talking but yea this cc grew way too much. I miss november when it was just a quite little place but I had around 1.9k too when I finished finals mind u that was early December
