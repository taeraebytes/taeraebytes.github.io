      <p>Man the editing team so lazy does anyone know if they hire a team or is it in house? Cause if its in house I bet they are juggling with other roles which in turn makes everything poor qualityðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ The way they try to copy the big4 recording and dancing session behinds but its so lazy</p>
