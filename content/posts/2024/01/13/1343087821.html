      <p>I've literally seen one of the things here be copy pasted in a pannchoa comment section lol and when I go to other ccs I see people spread things they clearly read on here it's hilarious lol

Like Zeroses are sneaky asfkkkk ik the big haobin retrospring had a lot of lurkers too bcs the Jiwoong gf things the qsoob renaissance and keonhee soobin tea and a lot of haobin themed discussion started there and immediately hit all other ccs and the tl it's crazy when you're a lurker of plenty of big ccs like me to see how much nosy people there are</p>
