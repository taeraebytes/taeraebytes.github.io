      <p>my bias is still included in the 6 and i would hate that group. gyuvin is a needed member people overlook having someone who can't sing but can dance decently then he gets 5 seconds of lines and fans can't talk shit. despite being lowk problematic he is funny and you can tell everyone loves him. taerae is there to balance vocals if it was all on hao and hanbin it would actually be haobin and friends with the amount of lines they already are getting. jiwoong reasoning is similar to gyuvin and even if i dislike him i am glad it's him and not jay because this fandom would be even messier and more cringe than it is now</p>

      <p>nah matt would stick out too much that is why i will always be glad taerae is in the group and his fans should be glad matt is there. unless u got someone shorter to add in i will not subject him to that i'll just be a hater and support matty's solo career it's ok</p>

      <p>ok anon my plan for matty wouldn't be him on the re-up. my delusional plan career for matty:

go back to his company, start digging out for the chungha rejects bc we know that this scam of a company kept all the songs she recorded, and steal that shit. then he needs to change his personality and market himself like ph1 keeho does, start dressing better, put the corny jokes to rest and make a bunch of lives, we also know that mnh also had some good connections so they need to dump all their good connections on matty. release a first album but a visual and conceptual album like querencia by chungha was, with at least 4 videos but all of them super artistic and we'll planned.</p>
