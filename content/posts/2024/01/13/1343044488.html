      <p>Different anon but that was me with hao, like I was there for calling out the serious stuff but the hashtags and emails of the most unserious stuff had me drained to the point I didnâ€™t even enjoy being on zerose twt. Like kpop should be a hobby not a job and I think the moment you get so invested it effects you in your real day to day life itâ€™s time to stop</p>
