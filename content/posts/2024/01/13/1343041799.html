      <p>gp only listens to like 10 groups not even and they dgaf abt scandals or dating unless it’s like rising sun level bad . but the kpop fans in korea r crazy so everyone generalizes. the only idols the gp prob even know/care abt are newjeans, wonyoung (maybe yujin she’s lowkey everywhere), jungkook, idk who else</p>

      <p>yea I feel like people forget in general kpop fans are a large chunk so when they're referring to gp they're also referring to just kpop fans the real gp could give a lesser fuck

      <p>There's a loot of idols that are known to the broader gp in Korea all of snsd all of exo maknae line of BTS at least Jennie all of twice etc etc but kpop has always been more fandom based and that's fine, idk what the obsession w the gp is I'm not sure if there's even a gp for western music nowadays it's all fandoms and niche (this we had Taylor swift midnight album topping and dominating the chart and jungkooks thing too but it's entirely fandom based and not gp like for ex Gaga's hit in the 2010s)</p>
