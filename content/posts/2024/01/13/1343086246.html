      <p>Foxy brown said several times that they had no relation and was uncomfortable with the rumors
He's still a weirdo though, they say he dated bey at 21 but he already met her at 15/16 and they were already together often at 18 (nothing we can do about it obviously they've been married for a while but there's a lot of interesting stuffs about their early relationship for ex beys uncle used to say it wasn't real in the early days and that bey didn't like him) he was also close friends w r Kelly and the other creep producer that groomed Aaliyah and so were a lot of men in the industry, I think they should be all investigated</p>

      <p>Yeah some people think foxy was lying etc but idk she looked really touched that people thought that

For bey I do think their relationship was real and not just business cause she was really going through it during otr tour and that's when they started having relationship problems due to his constant cheating and allegedly broke up for a while there were a lot of blind items around that time saying she had a deep depression
No matter how you look at it he did groom her and put her through it but well they have an empire and 3 kids and seem to work better as a couple now, if something big were to be exposed a lot of things would fall appart in the entire industry</p>
