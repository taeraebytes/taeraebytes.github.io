      <p>It depends on the implant, I've seen chin implants that don't look bad at all and terrible jaw shaves. A bad jaw shave example would be Karina around 2021 like she looked uncanny, also NCT yuta did a jaw shave and it was badddd. Usually jaw shaves look even worse</p>

      <p>yup, also the worst about jaw shaves is that with a chin implant you can just take it off if it looks bad, but with a jaw shave the bone will obviously never grow back so the only option is adding fillers to make it look better but fillers dissolve and the person gets stuck on a filler cycle</p>

      <p>I think that by black mamba she only had her jaw done, that's when she looked like WJSN Yeoreum and most knetz were gagging about winter instead, then around savage she got something done to her eyes and that's when the whole AI visual thing started, during their break between girls era she did something to her cheekbones and fixed her jaw a bit</p>
