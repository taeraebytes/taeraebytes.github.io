      <p>Ik this is a bit much to say but considering this is a tea cc let me express myself; I think she's a drug addict and it severely hinders her creativity seriously so many of some of the best artists in the us fall off due to drug use...the way she acts and look really gives me red flags, is it just me?</p>

      <p>The thing about creativity obvs not comparable lol but I'm like this w Kanye like obviously he struggles w bipolarity really badly but he clearly has several addictions problems which is common for bipolars but it really ruined his creativity he really made graduation, mbdtf and tlop and now he's just another porn addicted weirdo with too much money really sad to see the fall off</p>
