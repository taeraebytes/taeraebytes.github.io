      <p>just finished watching some group fancams. in bloom choreo is just a mess wdbys deserve all the lashings from kzeroses but I like nkotb choreo. u can tell the members practiced so hard for crush their group performances were better. one thing I noticed is they always put matt, yujin and sometimes gunwook at the side/back while taerae, jiwoong were near the center (they did this for year end shows too) idk what's the logic behind that since I'm not a dancer. 

 yujin is a good dancer but just like anon said he always gave up half performance

hanbin need to practice his facial expressions he looks mad most of the time

gunwook, matthew, hao are good on stages</p>
