This sums it up 

he used to be my one pick in iland once I found this out I dropped him so fast the fact that heâ€™s still around pisses me off. i thought he had a lot of potential i wanted him to debut so bad but his personality was bad even during the show a lot of trainees were scared of him they all admitted in on broadcast heâ€™s just not a good man at all</p>
