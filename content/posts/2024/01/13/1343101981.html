      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service eitherüòÜ by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>

      <p>Taerae doesn't even get retweets from wakeone for his few solo schedules lol his koms appearance was never mentioned not even retweeted once by wakeone, his appearance on golden Girls with the senior singer also only got one retweet after meanwhile all the other idols companies that appeared had tweets announcing the show before it even happened üò¨ it's kinda funny how badly they treat him considering he's their only trainee that made it into zb1</p>

      <p>agreed on boys planet yujin and gyuvin also approached him first because they wanted to be friends with him and hao said before that he admires taerae's ability of making the atmosphere comfortable wherever he goes and that he wishes he had that skill too.. I think he's really friendly and he's really just here to make music (and he's also great at fanservice like I've never seen his fans he unhappy or criticising him for anything)</p>

      <p>Yeah he seems to be really just here for the music I remember a wakeone staff posted a congratulatory post for him and they mentioned that he originally joined wakeone with the intention of becoming a singer songwriter

      <p>while I could see it he's really and I mean reaaaaally close to the wakeonez (leejeong, munjung and phanbin though he seems more close to the first two) in a letter for junghyun's birthday he also said they should debut together here x/taeraevize/status/1641749627711139840?s=20 (the letter is so cute üò≠) 

I could see him going both ways tbh there's a chance he goes the Jo Yuri road and becomes a soloist but I could also see him staying loyal to waleonet wakeonez and debuting with them.. you probably don't know but they talk about each other all the time like evvne members would just randomly bring up taerae in fansigns and they keep hanging out I think this might be like their way of keeping that bond active until they can finally debut together</p>
