      <p>Hanbin visually mogging the other boys in every picture I'm so proud of him...
It also makes me realize that while we shit on zb1s visual they're really good looking by Kpop bg standards bcs Hanbin is amongst the shortest in the group and like 5 members could be visuals in other groups</p>

      <p>I think heâ€™s right in the middle in terms of height but in sb1 terms he may look shorter but when you compare to other groups zb1 as a whole are quite tall like the tallest being 19 and 184 is crazy since he will probably get taller</p>
