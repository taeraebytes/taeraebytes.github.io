      <p>reasonable rejection? bitch fuck you and worry about gunwook's irrelevant ass never getting any solo gigs cause no one's checking for him meanwhile wk1 keep restricting the most popular members for the sake of the other flops.</p>

      <p>fan recommendation -> company contact -> rejection. (Possiblity) Are you dumb they never clarified how they came to contact the company because again hao is only popular for a fifth gen kpop idol... like there's 4th gen sm artists bigger than him there

      <p>no one said he's more popular than 4gen c idols... the diff is he's the first c-idol to win a korean survival show lol and that's a huge deal and they take national pride very seriously no one's saying he's a superstar level famous there, but what he did was remarkable and everyone was talking about it after the finale cause boys planet flopped in china</p>
