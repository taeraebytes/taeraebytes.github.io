      <p>c-mulbok thinks yj deserves PO2 so they insult hb everyday. and taerae, u like it or not but heâ€™s (estimated) K-PO2 he has a strong k-fandom, k-kultaraes never think zh as a threat but for hb.. they did compare how wk1 treat hb. u can lurk on their acc or instiz actually. thatâ€™s why they prefer hataez (while k-rosins only gaf to luckyz and haribozðŸ˜‚)</p>

      <p>Zerocolas also hated matt back then cause they wanted Yujin at #3 they're cool w him now tho. This is all because of those gyujin and Jiwoong shippers without them Yujin would've been way higher and we wouldn't have to deal with those 2</p>
