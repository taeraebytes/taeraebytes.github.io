      <p>c-mulbok thinks yj deserves PO2 so they insult hb everyday. and taerae, u like it or not but heâ€™s (estimated) K-PO2 he has a strong k-fandom, k-kultaraes never think zh as a threat but for hb.. they did compare how wk1 treat hb. u can lurk on their acc or instiz actually. thatâ€™s why they prefer hataez (while k-rosins only gaf to luckyz and haribozðŸ˜‚)</p>
