      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service eitherðŸ˜† by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>

      <p>Taerae doesn't even get retweets from wakeone for his few solo schedules lol his koms appearance was never mentioned not even retweeted once by wakeone, his appearance on golden Girls with the senior singer also only got one retweet after meanwhile all the other idols companies that appeared had tweets announcing the show before it even happened ðŸ˜¬ it's kinda funny how badly they treat him considering he's their only trainee that made it into zb1</p>
