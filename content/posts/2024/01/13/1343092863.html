      <p>zb1 instiz going crazy rn...kzeroses r talking about sending trucks to w1 cuz of their social media manager only rting hanbin content + the insta story that was uploaded being a literal hanbin focused fancam. its not directed at hanbin at all though, its targetted towards their manager who is seemingly borderline obsessed with hanbin and is causing this chaos. pls w1 needs to fire whoever their socmed manager we need them gone. kallindans are mad as hell cuz its just weird and creepy</p>
