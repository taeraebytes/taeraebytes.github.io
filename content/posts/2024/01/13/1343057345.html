      <p>long answer coming~

Oh anon,let me answer this like the CHRISTIAN I AM! the illuminati to me is the equivalent of the evil forces (satan) of the world wrecking their havoc. i dont know if theres some distinct group within it but what i do know is this, someone rises to fame. they ask what do i do to get more famous? then boom we see them painting pentagrams under their eyes but atleast they have hit songs about pussy! see doja cat 😹. so most singers in one way or another have to submit to this sort of “illuminati” system or else they get shunned.. as u can see jeffree star  tweeted about escaping the illuminati not too long ago lolz. so yea, think like Beyoncé for example she was close to God and a huge Christian then all of a sudden she started calling herself sasha fierce and doing ancestor worship like girljshdh.</p>
