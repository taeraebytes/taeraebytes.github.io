      <p>has yujin done anything? i'd hope not due to his age, plus he looks pretty similar from the few predebut things i've seen. sometimes i look at his teeth and am like "are those veneers" bc they look kinda perfect but that may just be bc i'm traumatised by one of my ult groups getting a veneer groupon from their local orthodontist or whatever (bet it's totally hard to guess which group this is LMAOOOOOOOOO).. his nose also kinda makes me pause and maybe he got the typical eyelid work but i'm only saying these ones bc they're the usual kpop procedures. i hope he got nothing done even tho that's delusional üôè</p>

      <p>as a gg stan i stan lit everyone from big to nugu, i havent seen a gg as ‚Äòmale-gazey‚Äô as triple s for a while, the ceo has said plenty of times he plans to put as much visuals in the group for guys to enjoy, they have this dorm reality set up recording them all the time, young ass members like its such a mess literally no female fans want to stan them in korea even though theres a lot of potential stan attractors,, all in all the ceo has given up on vocals theres about 3 or 4 passable singers in a group of 26 which is shameful</p>

      <p>bc kpop is not ready for that shit, people want to see seasoned idols or at least people with talent, they don't enjoy the akb48 part of including inexperienced people</p>

      <p>akb48 system is kinda clever if you think about it, they had elections each year where people bought albums to vote and rank members based on popularity and to determine the center for a single like if we think about it a lot of the things akb48 did were the blueprint for kpop</p>
