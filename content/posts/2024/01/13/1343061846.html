      <p>Ik this is a bit much to say but considering this is a tea cc let me express myself; I think she's a drug addict and it severely hinders her creativity seriously so many of some of the best artists in the us fall off due to drug use...the way she acts and look really gives me red flags, is it just me?</p>

      <p>ariana's music was never good to begin with. it's all just run of the mill radio pop with rnb influence. i don't get the hype tbh</p>
