      <p>I think she has the most experience out of everyone, she worked with cube for a long period of time and iirc when she was in cube she was Hyuna manager and well we all know that Hyuna solo career during cube was at her peak, then Hyunadawn gate happened and she got assigned to the Hanbin, Matthew, Guanlin and Seonho potential group. Then Guanlin gate happened, the group got pushed back, she went out of cube, Ravi offered her a job I guess and she offered Hanbin if they wanted to come with her and he agreed. Seonho also seems to still be close with her bc she also attends to some of his events and post's a lot about him although he's not under the l1ve</p>
