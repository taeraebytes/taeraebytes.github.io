      <p>Actually group fancams are worse you can immediately tell when a member loses energy or messes up and it fucks up with the synchronisation , i liked the recent ccma performance but watching the group fancam changed my thoughts just a bit , taerae hunny i know ur trying your best but he really reduces the dance skill of the group to level 0 he just cannot dance ,, everyone else was v good actually but yujin loses energy halfway and stops caring lmao , gyuvin has had great improvement i must say</p>

      <p>tbh i still think that the hate clouds y'all minds and bc they are taller they get noticed more but imo taerae is an even worse performer than jiwoong and gyuvin, he's stiff but he also doesn't complete the moves and his energy is weak</p>

      <p>I think honestly taerae sucks and we know that but they do stick out more even if it's height it's there in ur face and they intentionally hide taerae in choreo anyways
