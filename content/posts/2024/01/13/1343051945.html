      <p>It depends on the implant, I've seen chin implants that don't look bad at all and terrible jaw shaves. A bad jaw shave example would be Karina around 2021 like she looked uncanny, also NCT yuta did a jaw shave and it was badddd. Usually jaw shaves look even worse</p>

      <p>yup, also the worst about jaw shaves is that with a chin implant you can just take it off if it looks bad, but with a jaw shave the bone will obviously never grow back so the only option is adding fillers to make it look better but fillers dissolve and the person gets stuck on a filler cycle</p>

      <p>Sorry but i cant get into aespa visuals hype at all , i can see they are all very pretty but ppl making them out to be some kind of godess level of visuals idk especially winter and karina no offence but they are very nugu gg visual level , in the rank of sm visuals i dont see them anywhere near eugene yoona krystal sulli or irene ... maybe my standards are high cause i was a krystal sulli stan and they just dont come close to them visually physically or even their aura they are very plain</p>

      <p>I think because they're balanced and every member is very pretty it works no one's bringing it down so I get it. new jeans gets the same thing but they're literal children and have softer visuals aespa have more striking visuals. Idk maybe cuz I love them they're so insanely gorgeous to me and dkm but I never got the Krystal hype but sulli yea it's also cuz they have good visual chemi but you cant compare 4th gen quality to anything old these days
