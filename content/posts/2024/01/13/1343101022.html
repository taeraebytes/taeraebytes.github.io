      <p>the way they didn't post a separate zerofocus tweet for MC matthew and zhang hao's award is making me ctfu. poor hanbin is gonna get whacked again by akgaes because of them posting a seperate zerofocus for him after the AAA. they didn't post zerofocus for  zhang hao's lee mujin service either😆 by the looks of it, wakeone is hellbent on converting the remaining normal hao stans into hanbin antis</p>

      <p>Taerae doesn't even get retweets from wakeone for his few solo schedules lol his koms appearance was never mentioned not even retweeted once by wakeone, his appearance on golden Girls with the senior singer also only got one retweet after meanwhile all the other idols companies that appeared had tweets announcing the show before it even happened 😬 it's kinda funny how badly they treat him considering he's their only trainee that made it into zb1</p>

      <p>agreed on boys planet yujin and gyuvin also approached him first because they wanted to be friends with him and hao said before that he admires taerae's ability of making the atmosphere comfortable wherever he goes and that he wishes he had that skill too.. I think he's really friendly and he's really just here to make music (and he's also great at fanservice like I've never seen his fans he unhappy or criticising him for anything)</p>

      <p>not to do deep analysis but i think taerae would realistically be a great leader and i see him leading a future group, allindans just hear me out but i think hb can lead toward being too tense (when situations are awkward sometimes i cringe by how he handle it) or too friendly, whilst taerae has a balance of being serious and reading the room whilst also being very comfortable with everyone , also speaks very well and can impromptu / cover for the members well he just takes a step back bc he knows thats not his role ... overall hb isnt a bad leader at all but i do think he was mainly chosen for age and experience not really skills</p>

      <p>I think hanbins the stereotypical leader type but taerae seems good smth tells me he wouldn't be taken as serious lol but I feel like he's more creative and dynamic in howd he handle things
