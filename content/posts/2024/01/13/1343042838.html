      <p>I mean I wouldnâ€™t say the bubble pics since he post a lot of cute ones too but possibly trying to distance himself from being seen as cute because Iâ€™ve heard him say heâ€™s not cute a lot of times even though I think heâ€™s quite naturally cute over sexy</p>

      <p>I think Hanbin Ricky and Gunwook are very insecure and you can tell from things like that sometimes, I feel bad for them but I do also feel full body cringe when they do things sometimes cause it comes off as very try hard</p>
