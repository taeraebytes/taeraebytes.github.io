      <p>I mean I wouldn’t say the bubble pics since he post a lot of cute ones too but possibly trying to distance himself from being seen as cute because I’ve heard him say he’s not cute a lot of times even though I think he’s quite naturally cute over sexy</p>

      <p>I think Hanbin Ricky and Gunwook are very insecure and you can tell from things like that sometimes, I feel bad for them but I do also feel full body cringe when they do things sometimes cause it comes off as very try hard</p>

      <p>(pure subjective analysis in my part I obviously don't know these men)
Ik Ricky is very insecure but maybe because he doesn't talk much I haven't really felt but I do struggle to watch gunwooks fs or some of his lives cause God he really has self esteem issues and some weirdos are profiting of that and it's really sad cause he's just a kid and I worry about him a lot cause I know the managers and execs probably don't care for him much and the members are too young to guide and raise him

I really have a hard time w Hanbin cause he's always been in my bias line and ik he really struggles with the hate and (I'm speculating) with repressing his sexuality, he had a lot more charisma and presence before debuting and now you can feel in his fc or even fs that he's super tense and that's not for a performer, he's been better recently but during pretty much the entirety of in bloom and crush I felt like he was about to break down at any minute, in fs his bf fanservice feel so unnatural his smile don't reach his eyes and his shoulders look so tense I can't help but think ab how much he's repressing....so sometimes those bubble vocals, those facial expressions etc can come off as really desperate for validation and idk I feel bad for him but it makes me wonder if he's really built for this life yk</p>

      <p>ok please don't make me cry for the most part his lives are pretty cute and sincere imo they do get crazy sometimes but yea his fans are definitely taking advantage of him like overwhelming any of 30yr old fans is crazy. and it upsets me and you can tell he really does appreciate younger fans but he's been getting popular with younger girls recently so maybe change will come. I think it's about him setting boundaries so it'll be a while before then ngl

Awww miskeen I hope things get easier for him
