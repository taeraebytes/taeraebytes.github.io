      <p>Itâ€™s a new list that is supposed to be a competitor for brand ranking reputation, it takes stats from k forums ect and afaik it has nothing to do with the br list and is a separate entity but is similar in purpose. Also why is everything fraudulent or made up to you guys ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ like fraudulent to who, like I donâ€™t care if you donâ€™t want to pay attention to it but calling it fraudulent when yk damn well people would parade and plaster it around if their bias ranked high is so odd ?</p>
