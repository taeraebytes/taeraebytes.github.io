      <p>your anons are so dramatic they've never experienced stanning a group at their peak and slowly watched them fall from grace before (tbz) like it doesn't matter we already got our clout and nothing will be worse than crush trust me on this one plus trust haobin to keep the fandom alive with their stupid bait also gyubi will take us to the sky with the yaoi rp phase he has with ricky</p>
