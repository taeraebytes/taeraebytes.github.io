      <p>Everytime I see Matthew it makes me angry because he's not particularly talented, is super ugly and botched, doesn't have an entertaining personality and is short but still got to debut at #3 like imagine if it were a woman, this spot should've gotten to Kamden</p>

      <p>goddamn but Kamden is a lot more boring than matthew to me and fuck the gossip he doesn't have to be handsome or a visual like we can take a cutie but hey he wasn't as popular so look at kamden now. Like Matthew isn't hideous like ur not gonna throw up you'll be fine
