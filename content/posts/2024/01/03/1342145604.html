      <p>i feel like it will either flop or be ditto 2.0. cuz talk saxy flopped in comparison to gag (although it’s still like #120 in melon so it’s honestly still doing better than most bgs) so gag could’ve just been a one hit wonder. honestly kind of rooting for them bc if a rookie bg manages to sweep the charts it would prob be  monumental</p>

      <p>riize is in the same production center of sm as exo so if anyone’s stealing exos old songs it’s them tbh but maybe wakeone can use their album sales money to bag the ones who quit instead of putting more food on the fatass managers plates</p>

      <p>itzy and got7.. lord save us but melting points concept was nicer than yits to me the concept looked more rounded and put tgthr a&r has more to do with concepting rather than music right

      <p>Oh god, that explains so much. No, A&R has to do with sourcing producers composers and lyricists and getting them to work together + coming up with the sound/worldview of the artist's releases for the team to work towards

Itzy and got7 being conceptless and having the most bland bsides 😭😭</p>
