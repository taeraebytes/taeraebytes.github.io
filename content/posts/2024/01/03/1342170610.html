      <p>One thing I wanted to say is Iâ€™ve seen more k fans who enjoy geonihani compared to the ifans and i think we shouldnâ€™t let the fandom ruin things for us. If you see an annoying allin just block them, if allins see an annoying gpd they should block them but not interacting with geonihani because of the annoying fandoms is something i can never understand tbh.
I feel like kzeroses are so much more mature and less dramatic than izeroses.</p>
