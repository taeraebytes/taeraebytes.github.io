      <p>I think going to the gym is fine if you keep the bulk down like jiwoong you can't really tell when he wears clothes and Matthew is just short so he'll look wider and the others are just skinny gunwook has a big build naturally so he looks built even tho he's real skinny and hao is actually in the gym his arms are bigger than gunwooks and gyuvin is attempting Ricky's the only one that doesn't gym cuz I'm p sure yujin wants to or does
