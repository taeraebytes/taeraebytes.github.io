      <p>Idk if it’s just me but it feels like zb1 doesn’t have that much ot9 content outside of like zbtv. Like it’s kinda funny to think that x1 were blocked from most broadcast channels after the allegations first came abt but they still had like a large amount of ot11 content for the fans
Like this isn’t all of it but here’s a few list of stuff I remember them doing:
mafia game in prison 
idol room 
tmi news 
wekpop 
let's eat together
amazing saturday
run.wav 
idol league</p>
