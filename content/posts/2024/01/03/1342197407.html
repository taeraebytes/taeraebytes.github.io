      <p>i don't even think he needs to lose weight but gyuvin is so obvious after fans said he did now he's talking about it all the time trying to get sympathy like bitch? don't talk about how you ate fucking 8 ice creams then if you want me to feel bad for you? but actually i never will feel bad he gives rich kid who grew up never having to know shit about the world and gets mad when you tell him to learn. also he has ruined his image among kfans because whenever he gets dragged i see so many qrts talking about how he's stupid and it's too real. he said on live that pizza was a french food and when i saw people laughing i just sighed because all he's doing is reinforcing their thoughts like he is truly making it worse for himself. i just can't believe all the shit he gets away with, any other member and they'd be getting dragged but all his fans do is fucking baby and coddle him and make it worse</p>

      <p>Jrnrngjtnkckdjfnjfnf omg yea gyuvins just a dumb boy a huge chunk of his fandom is trolls now and I always get surprised when he frequently reads out their hateish comments like always today he read out the piggy gyuvin comment idky he does that lowkey.. but I'm ngl you can tell he talks about certain things to get a reaction but he's just that type of person to say all that he's def interesting...ðŸ˜­

      <p>Why is anon mad, if we are being real Gyuvin this only 3 bad things/
- the coming out comment that was insensitive 
- the autistic meme
- sending ricky butt pic without his consent 

(Iâ€™m not counting the 1st scandal because that was a normal word misogynistic men twisted but itâ€™s still a word in the dictionary) 

Why anon acting like he does things that could send to jail everyday</p>
