      <p>Hot take time

- ZB1 won‚Äôt get anymore famous/will stay around the same level of fame in 2024

- Jiwoong should just be an actor atp

- Taerae keeps killing off all his popular duos because he wants to gyurae to be royalty 
 and it‚Äôs honestly annoying and becoming very BEG and desperate on his part. Like that video of him forcing himself onto gyuvin at AAAü§Æ.

-Ricky needs to start interacting with his members more. IDC if you‚Äôre introverted and trying to push your image most of the time, it‚Äôs okay to smile and act fake with ppl for 5 minutes, literally never talks abt other members in his bbl, and never hangs out with them, no shade tho.

- ZH does not have resting face, he‚Äôs just pissed off a lot. 

- Matthew let you‚Äôre nose scar heal and get lip filler.

- Gyuvin, know you‚Äôre boundaries and stop overstepping with you‚Äôre members, just because you‚Äôve known Ricky the longest does not mean you have the right to expose what he does during the day and take photos of him without consent. Use this time to practice dancing.</p>

      <p>NO SIS ONLY BLESSINGS AND PRAYERS FOR ZB1 

jiwoong sucks at acting

Ok don't say it like that omgüò≠ but it's working a little these days gyuvin isn't running away anymore 

Ok Ricky honestly isn't even that bad he interacts a good amt in my opinion and you can tell he's opening up a bit more 

He just seems like he gets annoyed easily honestly 

No lip filler that would be ugly and that's not up to him he just needs to cover it up better but I never notice 

And yes DO BETTER GYUVIN

      <p>DAMN SIS 

ok hanbin is genuinely a sweet person like sorry that's when thing I don't think he can be dragged for definitely he's the type to be "I'm such a nice guy" but I think he's got the facilities to say all that. 

Jiwoong made it and it's been his day off ever since

And I agree he's not given credit for being as calculated as he is I find it funny 

And yes matthew is genuinely.. genuineüò≠ u can tell he doesn't think much he's endearing to me like I can't even hate 

Ricky is a very insecure person and he cares about his image so yea that's gonna happen

Ok please don't ever gunwooks personality is genuinely so far from the regular Korean misogynistic male I'm not gonna give him too much credit but anyone that pays attention can tell he's a genuine kind person even + he got bullied and got called hannam because of how he looks which isn't fair üòí I don't think gyuvin isn't it a nice person either he's just... hm if were gonna call people hannam do it to people who've shown proof just saying. But whatever that's ur opinion and hot take cant be mad at it
