      <p>an a&r just picks the songs for the groups, concepts are done by creative directors. for itzy the ones they released before loco were good songs, idk why people talk about the b-sides being shit when they were amazing until their loco full album, even miss IU was gagged by one of them. 

for GOT7 their title tracks were a hit or miss, some of those were a snoozefest like eclipse or not by the moon but a lot of groups wished they could release songs as good as if you do, you calling my name, look and lullaby.</p>
