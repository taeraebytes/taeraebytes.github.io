      <p>i see where ur coming from but u have to be dense if u don’t think ppl use nepo baby as a drag and to discredit his abilities and hard work. it’s not bullying but it’s annoying and op deserved to be humbled. most ppl r on his side abt this anyways it’s only the jobless freaks on twt trying to start shit abt it</p>

      <p>yea I get that it's obv op was using it as a drag but I'm like 100% sure he knew what he was getting himself into debuting whether his father helped him debut or not is unknown but the fact that he's his son will allllways follow him esp they're gonna collab😭 it's just not a norm to respond to things like this and it was for op and just tiktok comments people being upset at what he said which is mostly kfans is mostly due to cultural context differences. And even to regular twt users it can come off as arrogant because generally people just don't like nepo babies and there's been a surge in nepo baby hate after that vanity fair article, but most of that is just them trynna drag Anton ngl. Like I said it's also a lot of kbriizes mad too so it's not because they're trynna drag but I don't think it's a big deal and it's humorous for tiktok and twt user which was who it was meant for. That's my piece I'm sure if I ulted him tho I would've been wishing death but I like him and this is just what I think

      <p>winter + school concept + lofi instrumental korea will eat it up. i don’t think it’s a ballad tho the drum beat is too pronounced. but also u can’t rly tell what it’ll sound like until the whole thing comes out vocals add alot to a song</p>

      <p>i feel like it will either flop or be ditto 2.0. cuz talk saxy flopped in comparison to gag (although it’s still like #120 in melon so it’s honestly still doing better than most bgs) so gag could’ve just been a one hit wonder. honestly kind of rooting for them bc if a rookie bg manages to sweep the charts it would prob be  monumental</p>

      <p>riize is in the same production center of sm as exo so if anyone’s stealing exos old songs it’s them tbh but maybe wakeone can use their album sales money to bag the ones who quit instead of putting more food on the fatass managers plates</p>

      <p>hi music production nerd here id love to talk about k-pop producers. not a lot of people know about these producers in depthim actually so autistic over this so dont mind me.

full8loom are a good choice – they're really good producers, have a good track record and work with many artists including kep1er, wjsn, astro and golcha so i want them to work with zb1. they produced my favorite kpop song of all time (save me save you wjsn) and also sistar's i swear, drippin's nostalgia, together forever by kep1er (which is by far their best track) amazing output, sounds and they make high quality music.

there's also MONOTREE a production firm created by former sweetune producers (we'll get into them later) best known for their older works with loona. what people don't know, however, is that monotree is a label and there are multiple different producers underneath each with their distinct sounds. hwang hyun for example, one of the founders of monotree. he's more unlikely cause he only focuses on one singular group (onf) nowadays and they're his passion project of sorts (he's not being paid to do any work for him and does it in his own volition, but that where most of the quality comes in.) he produces ALL songs for onf, the gp999 signal song and juju secret's lonely night (a must hear.) there's also innerchild (producer of older oneus' valkyrie) as another example... they made zb1's And I too btw. they are extremely versatile producers and are reliable.

and sweetune... definitely the best producers in k-pop. they made kara's rock u, many of infinites best works like the chaser and etc. they work with nugu groups nowadays and keep under the radar but their most recent works are actually with nine.i and their title turn it off, which is the best kpop title of 2023 undoubtedly. there's also road-b's nonstop which was one of 2022's best titles, lovelyz lost n found and golcha's lady. this one is also unlikely but they're genuinely so good i wish wakeone had the means of snagging them or were smart enough to.


newtype are relatively under the radar but also works with many different groups such as lovelyz (shining star, twinkle) fromis (be with you, close to you, think of you) they worked on nct127's superhuman and echo by the boyz. super solid discography all round and are probably more likely to appear in the credits of a zb1 song that the aforementioned. 

there's more super good ones but these are just some of kpop's best right now. again im a super nerd so any discussion of music production ill be here for lol.</p>

      <p>wow it seems like the really good producers like to do passion projects with smaller groups and one producer i rlly like is moonshine but idk if those swedes have produced for kpop after 2021 they made naughty seulrene and shake you down by tbz and a bunch of other songs
