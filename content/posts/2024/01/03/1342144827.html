      <p>Random stuff

- I was in a GC with Kamden’s dad for a bit and he talked so much shit abt zb1 it’s actually funny

- IVE leeseo accidentally leaked her TikTok acc on bbl not too long ago 

- There’s a rumor that sojang will make her return but I doubt it since she already had huge legal issues going on due to her now deleted videos, I think her subscribers should just move on tbh.

- I usually don’t take Kpop Stan’s seriously when they call their groups gay, but wjsn is an exception. Those girls are gay fr, and no seola is not the only gay one there’s a couple that are.</p>
