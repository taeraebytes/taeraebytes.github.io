      <p>I don't get it cause it works for newjeans because girls want this type of aesthetic, the men girls are thirsting over don't have this type of vibe tho they should be older and a bit more masc I also feel like no one stands out musically amongst bgs while most GG's have their own individual identity and that sets bgs back a lot. Which is a shame bcs if Kpop companies took a little risk there's a free spot to take BTSs crown rn like it's time put me in charge</p>

      <p>It works with newjeans yes cuz they're girls but also it was fresh at the time of their debut now everyones has taken away their group colors to be more "palatable" ig and then try these high teen boring concepts. Stayc do hiteen but they're fun but it doesn't work with bgs because uhhh what are u doing? It just looks dumb to me and yea nobody really stands out musically but the top ggs all have some distinction. I love a risk but so far looks like nobody's taking on
