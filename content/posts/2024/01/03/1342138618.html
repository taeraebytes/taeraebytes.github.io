      <p>can yall link some of the worst nose jobs? I wouldn't say sunghoon's is the worst I'm just forever salty they touched his nose and i think he keeps retouching it every comeback... his natural nose was so nice before it had a hump but now its just ðŸ˜¢

      <p>I don't think sunghoon nose is perfect but tbh that's the type of nose that a lot of people who want a nose job desire for, idk if people have noticed this but people who usually want nose jobs they barely go for natural looking noses, they want that high bridge/skinny nose look. so idt it's bad at all if we are talking about results, it's just obviously fake and not natural at all, i have this same opinion about kiss of life belle nose, it doesn't look natural but it's the type of nose that people who want the surgery thrive for.</p>
