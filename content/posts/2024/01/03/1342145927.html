      <p>Hot take time

- ZB1 won’t get anymore famous/will stay around the same level of fame in 2024

- Jiwoong should just be an actor atp

- Taerae keeps killing off all his popular duos because he wants to gyurae to be royalty 
 and it’s honestly annoying and becoming very BEG and desperate on his part. Like that video of him forcing himself onto gyuvin at AAA🤮.

-Ricky needs to start interacting with his members more. IDC if you’re introverted and trying to push your image most of the time, it’s okay to smile and act fake with ppl for 5 minutes, literally never talks abt other members in his bbl, and never hangs out with them, no shade tho.

- ZH does not have resting face, he’s just pissed off a lot. 

- Matthew let you’re nose scar heal and get lip filler.

- Gyuvin, know you’re boundaries and stop overstepping with you’re members, just because you’ve known Ricky the longest does not mean you have the right to expose what he does during the day and take photos of him without consent. Use this time to practice dancing.</p>

      <p>NO SIS ONLY BLESSINGS AND PRAYERS FOR ZB1 

jiwoong sucks at acting

Ok don't say it like that omg😭 but it's working a little these days gyuvin isn't running away anymore 

Ok Ricky honestly isn't even that bad he interacts a good amt in my opinion and you can tell he's opening up a bit more 

He just seems like he gets annoyed easily honestly 

No lip filler that would be ugly and that's not up to him he just needs to cover it up better but I never notice 

And yes DO BETTER GYUVIN

      <p>On zb1 dame I'll reiterate what I've said on another cc;
"I feel like zb1 had a shot to be much bigger but messed up their debut hype, the breaking point to me really was the fancon, it was a mess I would've redone the whole debut promotion (too much radio shows, promo too long, virtually no socmed presence, THE FANCON) 
They're still in a really good spot as far as bgs go but they could've been much bigger"
I think depending on how they'll be managed from now on they can get bigger but they could've reached way higher heights if not for the mess that was debut era and the bad decisions w crush (should've been the 3rd tt, mp shouldve been released earlier and they should've taken literally any other part for the teaser) I think they should invest on a better variety show like the one they had predebut it still their best, and maybe a good scandal that people feel strongly about could boost their careers a bit too</p>

      <p>i agree the events following in bloom then the lead up to crush is almost entirely responsible for their stagnation and even fans leaving they couldve been soooo good if the managemtn didnt fuck up their momentum but i have some faith that the japan debut and second cb rollout will reflect lessons learned. just because they havent fucke dup anything for awards shows yet and they seem to be smoother about things may 2024 treat them well

      <p>the thing is ppl like fresh and new things which id why everyone tuned into in bloom but all views and engagements have been declining since bc ppl got bored. zb1 also doesn’t have anything to make them stand out from other groups and their award stages have all been mediocre at best (except mama). i’m worried that their following might continue to decline especially after crush and bc there won’t be a korean cb for a while and during this period, we’re getting a riize cb and the pledis bg so the attention will shift to them. i just don’t have high hopes for zb1 unless they get a completely new creative and management team 😭😭</p>

      <p>the thing is theyre a bg and bgs always rely on fandom which zb1 have id rather than that than gp cuz they dont do much. zb1s fandom isnt going anywhere (unless wakeone gives reason) they just lost out on public favor which is fine if they continue to do decently they will b ok and if they release something actually really good theyll be back up id love it if they tried to do BETTER... but well see

      <p>ok true but a lot of ppl had to have left the fandom bc their engagements declined on socmed and views on content or cb promotions but i think the fandom will at least be stable from now on and maybe grow a bit</p>

      <p>i feel like lots of the engagement at the very beginning were casual viewers who only watched the final or even boys planet in its entirety but weren’t gonna stan the group (this was me with kep1er lol) like i feel like this hype at the beginning with it going down eventually is normal for a survival show group bc they’re all new and shiny to those who just hear about them sometimes but ultimately don’t care that much IDK HOW TO WORD THIS WITHOUT MAKING IT SOUND BAD BUT LIKE i don’t think it’s that bad</p>

      <p>No I get you that's true that's what always happens with survival shows because not everyone's pick gets in and people just watch to watch which I expected it's about gaining more momentum afterwards which I hope will happen 2024
