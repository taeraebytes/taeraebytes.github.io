      <p>Hot take time

- ZB1 wonâ€™t get anymore famous/will stay around the same level of fame in 2024

- Jiwoong should just be an actor atp

- Taerae keeps killing off all his popular duos because he wants to gyurae to be royalty 
 and itâ€™s honestly annoying and becoming very BEG and desperate on his part. Like that video of him forcing himself onto gyuvin at AAAðŸ¤®.

-Ricky needs to start interacting with his members more. IDC if youâ€™re introverted and trying to push your image most of the time, itâ€™s okay to smile and act fake with ppl for 5 minutes, literally never talks abt other members in his bbl, and never hangs out with them, no shade tho.

- ZH does not have resting face, heâ€™s just pissed off a lot. 

- Matthew let youâ€™re nose scar heal and get lip filler.

- Gyuvin, know youâ€™re boundaries and stop overstepping with youâ€™re members, just because youâ€™ve known Ricky the longest does not mean you have the right to expose what he does during the day and take photos of him without consent. Use this time to practice dancing.</p>

      <p>NO SIS ONLY BLESSINGS AND PRAYERS FOR ZB1 

jiwoong sucks at acting

Ok don't say it like that omgðŸ˜­ but it's working a little these days gyuvin isn't running away anymore 

Ok Ricky honestly isn't even that bad he interacts a good amt in my opinion and you can tell he's opening up a bit more 

He just seems like he gets annoyed easily honestly 

No lip filler that would be ugly and that's not up to him he just needs to cover it up better but I never notice 

And yes DO BETTER GYUVIN

      <p>On zb1 dame I'll reiterate what I've said on another cc;
"I feel like zb1 had a shot to be much bigger but messed up their debut hype, the breaking point to me really was the fancon, it was a mess I would've redone the whole debut promotion (too much radio shows, promo too long, virtually no socmed presence, THE FANCON) 
They're still in a really good spot as far as bgs go but they could've been much bigger"
I think depending on how they'll be managed from now on they can get bigger but they could've reached way higher heights if not for the mess that was debut era and the bad decisions w crush (should've been the 3rd tt, mp shouldve been released earlier and they should've taken literally any other part for the teaser) I think they should invest on a better variety show like the one they had predebut it still their best, and maybe a good scandal that people feel strongly about could boost their careers a bit too</p>

      <p>i agree the events following in bloom then the lead up to crush is almost entirely responsible for their stagnation and even fans leaving they couldve been soooo good if the managemtn didnt fuck up their momentum but i have some faith that the japan debut and second cb rollout will reflect lessons learned. just because they havent fucke dup anything for awards shows yet and they seem to be smoother about things may 2024 treat them well
