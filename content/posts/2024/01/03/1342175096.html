      <p>Idk if it’s just me but it feels like zb1 doesn’t have that much ot9 content outside of like zbtv. Like it’s kinda funny to think that x1 were blocked from most broadcast channels after the allegations first came abt but they still had like a large amount of ot11 content for the fans
Like this isn’t all of it but here’s a few list of stuff I remember them doing:
mafia game in prison 
idol room 
tmi news 
wekpop 
let's eat together
amazing saturday
run.wav 
idol league</p>

      <p>idol room: weekly idol so yeah zb1 went there already
tmi news: they don't upload tmi news since 2022 so mhm.
wekpop: it stopped around 2019
let's eat together: also stopped
amazing saturday: they went there already
run.wav: It stopped
idol league: they could go there but i think that they took a break from producing content just before zb1 debuted.

the main problem is that there's less and less idol shows nowadays, and bc idols are not even that big anymore the ones that can invite a lot of people prefer to invite comedians, reality show stars or actors instead. plus a lot of the new shows barely invite full groups and instead just invite 3 members at best.</p>
