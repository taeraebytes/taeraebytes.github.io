      <p>Kpop stan will riot if they see this but MAMA is the best award show this year so far, ccma is the only contender i fear, less made up awards and the winner based on real achievements and of course not attendance awards</p>

      <p>Hmmmm I guess but ccma made a category so riize could win a roty tho 😭 but I think so too mama was one of the best mma a close second cuz that was also sm fraudulence like people don't wanna give mama their flowers but they had some of the best performances and we have yet to see better
