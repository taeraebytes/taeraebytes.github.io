      <p>Itâ€™s a new list that is supposed to be a competitor for brand ranking reputation, it takes stats from k forums ect and afaik it has nothing to do with the br list and is a separate entity but is similar in purpose. Also why is everything fraudulent or made up to you guys ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ like fraudulent to who, like I donâ€™t care if you donâ€™t want to pay attention to it but calling it fraudulent when yk damn well people would parade and plaster it around if their bias ranked high is so odd ?</p>

      <p>I never said this one was fraudulent but br definitely is and has been proven to be full of inaccuracies for years. and in all my years Ive never paid attention like that my biases have touched very high but I never cared that's my piece tho
