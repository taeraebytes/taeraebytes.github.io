      <p>Agree with everything. I canâ€™t believe Jiwoong fans used to make us think he was gay and that him getting no cheers was homophobia, lol. I do think Ricky is straight tho, but at the same time I remember that he was an art major at ocsa ( if youâ€™re confused and want me to explain this to you I will)  + has those alleged rumors from the older guy</p>

      <p>can you explain the art major from osca part bc like yeah itâ€™s easier for art majors to be themselves/queers in an art school environment but straight guys in art are also a thing</p>

      <p>Just my personal experience because I almost transferred there as an art major and went to preview day like 2018-2019 (around the time Ricky was there) and like all the kids were queer including the teacher so yeah it is a stereotype ðŸ˜­</p>
