      <p>idk there’s like this weird mix of male idols bulking up but also wanting to be skinny like girl u gotta pick one. also i feel like some female idols have been getting skinnier and skinnier and i think it all started with wonyoung’s rise (absolutely not blaming her but companies and the gp) like just yesterday there was that sakura and sana tiktok and sana’s appearance just made me sad</p>

      <p>there's been many instances where things get too alarming but as always nothing changes I forget which group this girl was from but her bulimia was so bad that she was getting consistent throat infections to the point she left the group because her health was so damaged
