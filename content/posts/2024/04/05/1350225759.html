      <p>as a riyangi i would say, ricky is not suit to be an idol. he suit to be an artist. being an idol is not only about performance or visual but it requires "genuine" communication between him and fans, which i don't think he cares enough. he said love to his fans whenever he does live, but he even couldn't "show" some effort to make it happen. maybe he get banned maybe not, nobody knew unless he told us, but read some anon said his personality lead him to this extent, i think he even doesn't care if his fans leave him as long as he doesn't need to go from his "comfort" zone. i don't blame him, it just his personality is not flexible enough to adapt with idol world while he still rookies. also he's chinese, it's easy for k -fans to "dismiss" him. maybe he will be fine being an international artist rather than being a kpop idol.</p>

      <p>ok i dont think its as drastic as that you can tell he has a love for promoting it just seems like hes in a slump tbh even just how he appears to me in content and fan videos is different i think bro i depressed or smth. but regardless his communication is a concern amongst fans rn i feel like at least fixing it is a step into becoming more comfortable as an idol but idk hes still stuck on the mystery barely there presence thing idk
