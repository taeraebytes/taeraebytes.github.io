      <p>as a riyangi i would say, ricky is not suit to be an idol. he suit to be an artist. being an idol is not only about performance or visual but it requires "genuine" communication between him and fans, which i don't think he cares enough. he said love to his fans whenever he does live, but he even couldn't "show" some effort to make it happen. maybe he get banned maybe not, nobody knew unless he told us, but read some anon said his personality lead him to this extent, i think he even doesn't care if his fans leave him as long as he doesn't need to go from his "comfort" zone. i don't blame him, it just his personality is not flexible enough to adapt with idol world while he still rookies. also he's chinese, it's easy for k -fans to "dismiss" him. maybe he will be fine being an international artist rather than being a kpop idol.</p>

      <p>ok i dont think its as drastic as that you can tell he has a love for promoting it just seems like hes in a slump tbh even just how he appears to me in content and fan videos is different i think bro i depressed or smth. but regardless his communication is a concern amongst fans rn i feel like at least fixing it is a step into becoming more comfortable as an idol but idk hes still stuck on the mystery barely there presence thing idk

      <p>I will alwys say that yes it is sad to watch your fav be yelled at, but when idols say theyre gonna get a call by the company or scolded wht did you think? they have a contract, so its most likely ricky didnt let them know he would have a live, which is dangerous cause anything could happen and even when memebers r doing alone lives they are being monitored so that if any situation they arent able to switch a live off, the managers can do it, also ricky is a grown ass man</p>

      <p>Like it definitely wasn't nice to hear and ofc we'd feel bad but that's what a scolding or yelling sounds like and ngl they were off their shit that entire live it's like everyone forgets what they were doing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
