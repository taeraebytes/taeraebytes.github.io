      <p>There's nothing to break because not fitting the beauty standard has never been a clear marker of attractiveness or not? Please save this bullshit for someone u can upset and get real gunwooks visuals were received well for his special mcing on emka. ive looked at the mc history of every music show and this narrative u so badly wanna push just isn't sticking because the proof is very clearly in the pudding😭😭😭 not to mention the standards of today were not the standards a decade ago like you need to see how stupid u look dickriding arbitrary korean beauty standards as a foreigner who's never touched the country like how are y'all Korean supremacists and not even Korean DFKM😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

      <p>why are a lot of your anons so mean? like the og anon didnt even talk about hanbin and suddenly he's brought up in this conversation over his appearance 5 years ago. i honestly like your cc because of the fashion anon, there's a lot of input from her and thats why i stayed. some of you guys gotta chill</p>

      <p>exactly i wonder if these anons would even dare to say something mean to the boys' face umm some days i like you you say the sweetest thing about the boys and because i can see that you are bright a lot of the things you said and commented on give me more insights to kpop and zb1 too but some days when you were too mean to any of the boys i was really hoping you would stop and i would just skim through those ccs.. but 🤷‍♀️ this is your own space and if things got too much for me i can just stop visiting this cc

don't take anything i say to heart cause we're both strangers who don't know each other irl and you could be sweet irl for all i know</p>
