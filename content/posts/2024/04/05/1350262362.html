      <p>I think they're going with pure visuals only because leeseo also isn't a good mc I would've picked rei or yujin, they're gonna be an awkward duo lol I'm still seated tho</p>

      <p>Tbh. For Inkigayo, there's nothing there that can actually make the mcs popular unlike mubank. Like if you're not popular before being an mc in inkigayo, you'll still be unpopular after that unlike when you go be an mc for mubank</p>
