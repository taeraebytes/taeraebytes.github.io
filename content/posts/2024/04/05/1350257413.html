      <p>This is long im sorry i wanted to vent a little 

I'm genuinely heartbroken for hao I don't know how koreans can be so cruel to someone who loves kpop as much as he does, he literally left his home and his family behind to be an idol, learned a new language, and yet this country has been so cruel and xenophobic towards him since day one. 

do you have any idea how hard it is to live away from home? It's fucking terrifying and sometimes, I kinda wish he was a little bit more like &team K who doesn't give a fuck about them so my heart wouldnâ€™t ache so much every time I see the hate he gets. 

i was so against him going back to china after zb1 disbandment but not anymore i wanted to see him as an idol as much as possible because hes probably the last idol i will probably stan but if going back means that he wonâ€™t get much hate and if thatâ€™s what makes him happy than iâ€™m more than okay with it  

I never felt like this before i feel like hes a very sensitive person and i find myself so stressed out everytime he gets hate, i went to sleep today hoping that i wonâ€™t wake up to more hate directed towards him over his bbl messages , itâ€™s one thing to get mocked by locals and itâ€™s another to read it from his own fandom it honestly left a bad taste in my mouth 

Anyway im sorry and i just hope this will soon die down because im exhausted</p>
