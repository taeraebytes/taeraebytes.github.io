      <p>as a riyangi i would say, ricky is not suit to be an idol. he suit to be an artist. being an idol is not only about performance or visual but it requires "genuine" communication between him and fans, which i don't think he cares enough. he said love to his fans whenever he does live, but he even couldn't "show" some effort to make it happen. maybe he get banned maybe not, nobody knew unless he told us, but read some anon said his personality lead him to this extent, i think he even doesn't care if his fans leave him as long as he doesn't need to go from his "comfort" zone. i don't blame him, it just his personality is not flexible enough to adapt with idol world while he still rookies. also he's chinese, it's easy for k -fans to "dismiss" him. maybe he will be fine being an international artist rather than being a kpop idol.</p>

      <p>ok i dont think its as drastic as that you can tell he has a love for promoting it just seems like hes in a slump tbh even just how he appears to me in content and fan videos is different i think bro i depressed or smth. but regardless his communication is a concern amongst fans rn i feel like at least fixing it is a step into becoming more comfortable as an idol but idk hes still stuck on the mystery barely there presence thing idk

      <p>I will alwys say that yes it is sad to watch your fav be yelled at, but when idols say theyre gonna get a call by the company or scolded wht did you think? they have a contract, so its most likely ricky didnt let them know he would have a live, which is dangerous cause anything could happen and even when memebers r doing alone lives they are being monitored so that if any situation they arent able to switch a live off, the managers can do it, also ricky is a grown ass man</p>

      <p>Like it definitely wasn't nice to hear and ofc we'd feel bad but that's what a scolding or yelling sounds like and ngl they were off their shit that entire live it's like everyone forgets what they were doing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>Ur rmbring wrong gunwook was live first then it wasn't working then they asked if gyuvin could go live and then it was them three but Ricky didn't fit in the frame so he went live on his own and I think it was his first time ever? But he didn't ask for permission and they were live next to each other and gyuvin was hopping then they played their sex songðŸ˜­

      <p>nah it went like this

-gunwook started live stream with the three of them in frame but ricky barely fitting in then wifi sucked ass and gunwooks live went down
-gyuvin and ricky then went live simultaneously literally at the same time on their own bubbles. I'd say from the time gunwooks bubbled died to both of them turning it on at the same time it was 20-30 secs so there's no way gyuvin texted the manager and asked for permission in that short time frame 
-then one of the main issue not just rukidans had but zeroses was gyuvin and ricky both went live at the same time without permission but only ricky was picked out and scolded.

there was a lot of mistranslation/ misunderstanding, international fans thought k zeroses were pissed just because of the scolding and  harsh words but in reality they were pissed because ricky was the only one being scolded when it shoulda been ricky and gyuvin. Like he was singled out + the racial slang the manager used ('do u even understand what Im saying' to a foreigner and he used like some peasant speech when talking to ricky, u know how theres formal speech, casual speech and then like peasant speech) so it further looked like discrimination and not just a simple scolding. Like there was a reason why zeroses were mad not just rukidans.</p>

      <p>I rmbr the entire thing I was there I bought gyuvins bubble cuz I wanted to see gunwook. Cmiiw but I'm pretty sure gunwook himself said that he told or asked the manager ab moving lives whether they got a response or not? I'm not saying Ricky deserved that or there wasn't discrimination but this incident became the fuel to a narrative that's just sooo far from reality imo plus rukidans doxxed the wrong manager and intl zeroses have been harassing the one that's actually been nice to him this whole timeðŸ˜­. And they blame his inactivity on this too which jsut makes no sense even rukidans and cris were getting fed up
