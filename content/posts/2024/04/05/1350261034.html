      <p>There's nothing to break because not fitting the beauty standard has never been a clear marker of attractiveness or not? Please save this bullshit for someone u can upset and get real gunwooks visuals were received well for his special mcing on emka. ive looked at the mc history of every music show and this narrative u so badly wanna push just isn't sticking because the proof is very clearly in the pudding😭😭😭 not to mention the standards of today were not the standards a decade ago like you need to see how stupid u look dickriding arbitrary korean beauty standards as a foreigner who's never touched the country like how are y'all Korean supremacists and not even Korean DFKM😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
