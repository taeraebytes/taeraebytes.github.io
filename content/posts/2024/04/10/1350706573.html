      <p>The blonde girl wasnâ€™t in the bp vlog that was a different boy and girl who are his friends too. (This male and female friend are the ones he invited to the fancon). She was in the vlog that was posted closely after the final but it was a group of him and his friends and iirc him another male friend and 3 female friends went out for lunch after going to uni but the vlog had to be taken down because this was post final when he was in the group and therefore couldnâ€™t be shown. 
The pic saying heâ€™s with the girl in the pool is incorrect, 1 the girl is his little sister and 2 the pool is full of people and it was when his dance crew went on a trip with family members too. 
The pics circulating like the horse one and the sand one are all from the class uni trip and thereâ€™s multiple pics of loads of people being on that trip together. 
There was also a random rumour they tried to add too it of him being at a hostel but there isnâ€™t a single picture or account of him being at one so itâ€™s probably just added bs on this. 
In all itâ€™s really not that deep because it was debunked ages ago on the kside and itâ€™s already being debunked on the kside, if there was any truth to it the kside would have dragged him for it already. Also looking at his dance spaces 70% of the spaces he was in are female dominated so him having female friends isnâ€™t surprising and the fact there is nothing romantic at all about the pics at all shows that this seems more like a targeted attack trying to stir something because there is literally nothing to go off.</p>
