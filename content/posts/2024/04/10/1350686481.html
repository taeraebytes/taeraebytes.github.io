      <p>Gunwook is the most comprehensively talented (the most well rounded member) because heâ€™s great at every skill and he composes and writes lyrics and has experiencing leading and heâ€™s a great public speaker. The other members donâ€™t compose or write lyrics to the same level and Hanbin and Hao cannot rap. Itâ€™s okay to admit another member is more well rounded. That doesnâ€™t take away from someoneâ€™s favorite being better at one particular skill (aka Haoâ€™s vocals being above Hanbin and Gunwookâ€™s). I just donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s so hard for other to admit that. Admitting Gunwook is good at things other members canâ€™t do is OKAY TO DO. I promise Hao and Hanbin would agree that Gunwook can rap, compose, write, and is a great public speaker. Peopleâ€™s constant deflection of this reeks of insecurity.</p>
