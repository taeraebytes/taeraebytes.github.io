      <p>Is mcountdown not a big show? Im tryna figure out why hanbin’s popularity hasnt increased since becoming an mc. Usually being an mc helps idols gain recognition fast but his popularity has remained stagnant</p>

      <p>i went to mcd twitter acc a few days ago and realized hanbin has his own segment for monthly mcd picks, so he films a lot of extra content compared to the other mcs, like they are really trying for him which is fair since zb1 are an mnet group but most of the stuff they film for him is not really viral worthy, it’s just him acting cute in different costumes with different audios</p>
