      <p>the only thing hb excels at over other dance line members is tutting. as an idol dancer, the others especially matthew and gunwook, yujin too on a good day, are on par with him. itâ€™s like how xiaoting has the most dance experience in kep1er with her ballroom stuff but dayeon and hikaru overshadow her in their actual choreo because they are better idol dancers. anyway its so funny to watch allins throw tantrums over subjective rankings. they want him to stand out as the main dancer in a group full of main dancers. its just not gonna work sorry. anyways i prefer gunwookâ€™s dance style over hanbins. heâ€™s way more fun to watch in my opinion.</p>
