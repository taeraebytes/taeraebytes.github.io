      <p>they say in weibo that hbâ€™s picture is from univ trip while itâ€™s clearly a double date there is a clay doll between them in a beach picture. They went to a guest house at jeju which has bad reviews like Koreans say it's disgusting place. his cfans are even including pictures from different dates to prove that rumor is false ðŸ˜­ there is this pool photo which was taken at different days with his friend or dance studio friend but they are connecting it with the Jeju one.</p>
