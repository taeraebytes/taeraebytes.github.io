      <p>It was a post with 300 views and no one gaf because it was the same shit that got debunked in April ðŸ’€ although they randomly spread it on Weibo today tho. I thought it was going to be smth new but itâ€™s some random pics of him and a girl in the same place and then one of them buried in the same next to eachother but they left out the context, it was pics from a class trip and they left out all the pics of the group of students / copped themðŸ’€</p>

      <p>this was not the same shit which got debunked in April .
that material was when he kept liking sexy random/ model women in biknis photos, but his fans buried it with another issue of him liking photos of girl groups to make it seems like he is just a fan of girl groups</p>

      <p>The model was his school friend and came out to say they're just friends, he didn't like other model sexy pics and even the pics he liked of that girl weren't sexy they were just cropped by antis to sexualize her body

The dating rumours w the blonde girl was seen before but probably not true as there's no actual romantic photos between them or even them just hanging out by themselves and she seems to still be friends with him</p>
