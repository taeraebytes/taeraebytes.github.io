      <p>anon pannchoa hated taerae since forever it's teenage girls who have been pissed off ever since he had more high schoolers voting for him than for yujin this happens with every idol who's liked by teenage girls. it doesn't mean kfans think he's ugly he initially made it into the top 12 before the show aired because koreans thought he was good looking</p>
