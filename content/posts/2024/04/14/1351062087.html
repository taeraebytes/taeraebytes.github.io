      <p>I think he's middle class too but like REAL MIDDLE CLASS. I am talking about affording like 2 vacations per year and shit like that, not the people who claim themselves as middle class bc it's difficult to them accept that they are working class</p>

      <p>Because it's true fjnrnfnmfmdkkd I feel like every working class kid grows up thinking they're middle class because they never noticed and parents for the most part raise their kids without involving them in finances. Like I rlly thought we were balling as a child then I saw my fafsa efc was 0 and I got a full pell grantðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I mean I knew before then but yea real middle class are pretty well off
