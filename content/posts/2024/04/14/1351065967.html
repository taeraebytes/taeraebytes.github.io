      <p>He looks fine. You have no idea what balding looks like; I almost lost my frontal hair when I was 16; my mother told me it was due to puberty changes, but when I went to the doctor, he told me I had alopecia, and I have a terrible time going to school; weave is making my hair problem worse.</p>
