      <p>Not any of these anons but Iâ€™m pretty sure he posted it because fans had been asking for weeks for him to do it ( iirc) he mentioned it in a bubble live weeks ago saying heâ€™d learn it because a lot of fans were requesting it. I saw a lot of his k fans disappointed too so this seemed more like a donâ€™t be sad Iâ€™ll send a clip chill out. Also aside from the odd 1/2 akgae I havenâ€™t seen any of his fans tweak out over him not being part of the stage anyway.</p>
