      <p>Nugu's member's should be create a new group, they will not survive if they become soloists especially if their fan base is not strong. Being a soloist is also not easy unless they can find a musical character and type of song that is suitable among fans and non-fans. Sponsorship support is necessary, I hope from now, they should be start looking for sponsorship support whether it's people ðŸ¤­ or brands, Agency support is not enough.</p>

      <p>Hanbin if he stays in his current company is definitely getting put in a group they are holding auditions for it rn and if pulled into a bigger company it would also be for a group because they would want a fandom and promo that comes along with it ( granted zb1 keep hype till disbandment). Jiwoong is a different case because he will need to enlist soon after disbandment.</p>

      <p>yea solo is the least likely imo I can see a group ig but idk I don't think it would suit him considering the current idol age climate and jiwoong is gonna get married watch

      <p>They were looking for teenagers, I don't think they want them to debut with hanbin. The oldest one they wanted to recruit was like a 05 liner so mhm</p>

      <p>it's rlly up to the companies interests tho and his future plan his company treats him fairly well and they're CJ affiliated so they'd probably tighten their grip on hanbin he's their star gunwook has to escape tho omgðŸ˜­ðŸ’”
