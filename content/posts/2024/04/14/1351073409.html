    "reply": "U kinda got it all wrong technically mattwook is mainstream it's now the third biggest ship in the group and gpds liked gyuwook first if anything 😭 most gpds aren't rlly shippers but his rps space had grown ten fold in the last 4-5 months so it's diff from everyone else who's ships started from predebut or in bloom. and if there was no yaoi potential then mattwook wouldn't have gagged everyone so bad🤷‍♀️"
