      <p>Nugu's member's should be create a new group, they will not survive if they become soloists especially if their fan base is not strong. Being a soloist is also not easy unless they can find a musical character and type of song that is suitable among fans and non-fans. Sponsorship support is necessary, I hope from now, they should be start looking for sponsorship support whether it's people ðŸ¤­ or brands, Agency support is not enough.</p>

      <p>Hanbin if he stays in his current company is definitely getting put in a group they are holding auditions for it rn and if pulled into a bigger company it would also be for a group because they would want a fandom and promo that comes along with it ( granted zb1 keep hype till disbandment). Jiwoong is a different case because he will need to enlist soon after disbandment.</p>
