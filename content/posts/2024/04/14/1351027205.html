      <p>Gunwook is deep down insecure and has to wear a mask to protect his fragile soul. Wild idolâ€™s trauma left an impact on him. He then put a mask of a bold tough guy to protect himself, he doesnâ€™t want people to see his weak side which is understandable. Intelligent people tend to overthink, worry about every little thing and are prone to depressions. Imagine his feelings when zb1 disbands on his birthday? Heâ€™ll be heartbroken to say the least and his birthday will forever be associated with one of the saddest moments of his life. Poor wookðŸ’”</p>

      <p>I agree they're all kind of different in their insecurities and where they stem from so it kind of depends on what u consider. Gunwook isn't rlly a naturally insecure person in fact he's the opposite but it's rlly his experiences that made him this way and probably similarly to hanbin but his was in his early teen years and it's something that comes natural to him even tho he's in a good place and Ricky seems more of the "naturally" (this feels like the wrong word no one's rlly naturally insecure) but he's been insecure the longest and I feel like it's more ingrained in him?
