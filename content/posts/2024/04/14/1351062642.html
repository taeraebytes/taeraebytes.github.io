      <p>...üíî ugh I was so sad yesterday morning basically he got some hate comments during his bubble live today which is veryyyy out of the blue and not only did everyone watching see so did gunwook and you could visibly see him become uncomfortable and his face fall. It was towards the middle of the live and I think it was more than once (I only noticed he got quiet but I didn't know what was going on someone said he also got them at the beginning when he was eating too) and it was just rlly upsetting cuz this is his first face live in a while and he was going to sleep so he's the type to dwell on everything ever. And then uklob the biggest demon on planet earth got him jumped on twitter immediately after I was ready to die bruhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
