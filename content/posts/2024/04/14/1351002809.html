I havent watched boys planet yet but i wanted to give you a perspective on what i think about the members based on what i see on twitter and watching their performances:\n\n1. Matthew - He’s officially my bias 🫶 I just find him so cute and endearing and so incredibly talented. His dancing was what  i was drawn to first but I absolutely love everything about him. Hes so sweet and i love how he genuinely cares about his fans. I could go on and on about him  \n\n2. Zhang Hao - Love love love him! He’s like the perfect package handsome, smart, funny and talented. Like i get why he won first place. I admire him a lot and love how he’s making history as a foreigner. Hes just so iconic in every way \n\n3. Ricky - HES SO LOVELYYY. He was actually one of the only members i would constantly see on my timeline before i started stanning. His visuals are crazy and im obsessed with his vocal tone.\n\n4. Gunwook - This kid was born to be an idol like im not even kidding. He’s the perfect ace who else is doing it like him?? And he’s so cute and adorable i love him\n\n5. Yujin - The definition of a maknae lmaoo he’s adorable. I like how he’s always like this 😐 but when he smiles hes so cute. He actually suprised me with how talented he is. He’s my third favorite dancer after Mathew and gunwook.\n \n6. Taerae - I like him a lot! He’s charming. He seems so quirky and weird in a good way. He’s a great main vocal (along with Hao)\n\n7. Gyuvin - Okay im not gonna lie he gives dozen BUT his personality won me over <3\n\n8. Hanbin - I cant really get into him… idk he just seems basic? Like theres nothing about him that stands out to me :(\n\n9. Jiwoong - Idk he seems kind of aloof…. but i think he’s fine as hell. Like i need him so bad ugh",
