      <p>A+ list idol is or was in a process of heechulization lol.
He is always fanboying hard on the it girl of the moment, chasing a A list female idol at ISAC back in the days, going out with B+ list female idol a bit after, months ago he was seen with a more recent A list female idol at a concert (they even left together separated from the rest-a fansite of the female idol on twitter confirmed it was her with the male idol and a staff hanging out together, there's even pictures,  idk what kind of relationship they have but they're hanging out with eachother pretty often, while maybe flirting with another famous female idol around the same time 
He is in that famous GC, it's no wonder Heechul said recently that he likes hanging out with them group and even called one of them an alpha male LMAO they're all F boys</p>

      <p>This is such a lieeeee the only female idol jk interacted with publicly is Lovelyz Yein , RV Yeri , Jin was more linked to Chengxiao they were on a show together and said they supported each other after. idk how they linked JK to her. But one things for sure as someone who was in the whole shipping space for 3rd gen, WJSN, OMG, Lovelyz, Gfriend were very loved by male idols and senior celebs so many girls were rumored to date from them, compared to RV BP Twice who were more lowkey or either too busy and waited until they were older to date</p>
