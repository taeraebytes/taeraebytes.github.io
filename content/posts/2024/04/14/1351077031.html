      <p>u know gpds are bored when they start shipping gyuwook. was the mattwook terrorism not enough? i feel bad bc his 2 closest members are those two but the yaoi potential is just not there 😭 this is why his ships are never mainstream</p>

      <p>U kinda got it all wrong technically mattwook is mainstream it's now the third biggest ship in the group and gpds liked gyuwook first if anything 😭 most gpds aren't rlly shippers but his rps space had grown ten fold in the last 4-5 months so it's diff from everyone else who's ships started from predebut or in bloom. and if there was no yaoi potential then mattwook wouldn't have gagged everyone so bad🤷‍♀️
