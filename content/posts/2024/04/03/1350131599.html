      <p>actually thanks for bringing it up again because i need to get your asses for what went down that day

theres no glory in being the community doormat why are you posting geoniehanie threads while these allins call gunwook an ugly incelâ€¦ gpds irk me so bad because without fail they will always prioritize glazing hanbin over protecting gunwook

you think if youâ€™re ot9 enough people will care about gunwook but they do not and will not and in doing this youve just created a passive ass group of fans that ultimately does nothing for him

you came in here trying to talk about how ot9 gpds are different so allins dont think yall hate hanbin but itâ€™s not like these akgaes actually care, all they care about is making hanbin look like the most hated person on the planet so no one can clock how horrible THEY are to everyone else. TRUST they will continue to call gunwook a gargantuan thug in public and private regardless of how attached your mouth is to hanbinâ€™s nutsack</p>
