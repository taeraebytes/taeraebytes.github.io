      <p>Allindans do not care about hanbin they love to bathe in the manufactured pity and hate they delude themselves into because why are you engaging with a GOSSIP CC from a DIFFERENT PLATFORM and then creating the chance for ur bias to see itðŸ¤”? Not to mention they cut out my cc like this is crazy I have almost 18k I talk ab everything in hereðŸ˜­
