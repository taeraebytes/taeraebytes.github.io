      <p>Not the same anon but in late October I read one that said they were exhausted and homesick and kept getting irked by each other because they're so tired ðŸ˜­but they said it's only in passing and they'll feel better after a break also I have no proof but the members who got irked by the others are taerae Ricky Yujin Jiwoong and maybe Gyuvin</p>
