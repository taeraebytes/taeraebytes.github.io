      <p>since i saw some anons talking about hanbin's idol persona i want to vent a little bit. i'm probably going to sound mean but i'm so fucking tired of his constant fanservice istg... i tried to ignore it since the beginning but it's becoming so fucking unbearable i'm sorry ðŸ˜­ i got his bubble for a few months (i'm probably stupid too cause what the hell was i expecting) but him blowing up my phone every single day (and for long periods of time too) with bf-gf roleplay is insufferable... i had to unsubscribe lol. at least the other members are NOT that bad with the fanservice, it's quite average and bearable for me if that makes sense? i just wanted to get to know him more or something bruh i don't want to be your fuckass parasocial girlfriend even though almost everyone enjoys it ðŸ˜­ that's why i prefer an idol who might be a bit blunt but still sweet overall (like hao) because at least it feels more genuine to me for some reasons. at this point even hanbin's voice is fake af it's like he's constantly speaking with his customer service voice does he never get tired damn ðŸ’€ i don't doubt he's actually a kind person or whatever and i actually don't feel good about this but i gotta be honest he's giving me the ick so bad especially in some instances where i just have to roll my eyes a little bit i'm sorry lol</p>

      <p>omg diff anon and I never thought someone else felt the same way as me ðŸ˜­ don't get me wrong he's in my bias line and the excessive gf fan service was fine at first but it just gets so icky in the long run, like i try not to ignore it cause im not interested in gf stanism (for those who do that's fine i just don't!) but he's also not that funny so it really isn't helping me stay interested in him much longer i feel like I'm forcing myself to stan him atp because he's sweet and talented but I'm sorry it gets so boring and he doesn't give any interesting info about himself or interacts with the fans in a funny way it's always the same damn thing he replies with and I'm like ughhhhh okay anything to else (plz don't kill me I only confessed here cause it's anonymous)</p>

      <p>Wait this to me is less believable because Iâ€™m fluent in Korean too and the reason why hanbin is considered funny on the k side but now so much on the I side is because a lot of his jokes require you to be familiar with the nuance of the language. Thatâ€™s why a lot of his bubble moments and messages go viral on the k side. If you spoke fluent kr I donâ€™t think youâ€™d be saying this because Iâ€™d understand the boring perspective more from someone who didnâ€™t but as someone who does speak Korean heâ€™s a lot more funnier when you understand the linguistic behind what heâ€™s saying.</p>
