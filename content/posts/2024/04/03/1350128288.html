      <p>Not the same anon but in late October I read one that said they were exhausted and homesick and kept getting irked by each other because they're so tired ðŸ˜­but they said it's only in passing and they'll feel better after a break also I have no proof but the members who got irked by the others are taerae Ricky Yujin Jiwoong and maybe Gyuvin</p>

      <p>Taerae has secret beef w Hao I just feel it in my soul
Jiwoong only likes Hanbin Gunwook Taerae and Yujin, kinda likes Ricky but it's not reciprocated
Ricky and Yujin can't stand Jiwoong and at some point you could tell they talk shit in oriv because everytime something embarrassing happened they would look at each other immediately ðŸ˜­
Hao Gyuvin bonded over their dislike of Jiwoong and they influenced their friends mattbin to also kinda become haters</p>
