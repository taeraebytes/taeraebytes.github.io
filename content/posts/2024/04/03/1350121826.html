      <p>atp do you think it would be easier and beneficial for the group if jw actually leaves? i’ve thought about the scenario of ot8 group and why is it so much better djsksnd 😭 what is his contribution to the group exactly aside from his gay4pay act? their dynamic without him would be so much more like a friend group with a closer age range also. sometimes i feel like his distance also comes from his past exp (and very traumatising i’d add) but he just? doesnt make an effort i feel like? at first i thought maybe mt and jw would be closer but they just fell off hard. even the ppusamz rise recently just showed us mt is very awkward and reluctant towards him but still have to do it for works ksdnjf (chase that bag hun), like the way he rejected jw wiping his sweat hurts me even if i dont like the duo 💀 idk i sometimes wish we could wipe the ssibal off the internet but the dynamic within the group with him is to me unsalvageable</p>

      <p>like he doesn't live with them so crucial building blocks to dynamic building just don't exist and even with the hyung title he's not a very good one and interacts with 2 ppl only. I srsly more bait from him than anything else and he's a complete joke now 😭😭😭 like almost everyday there's smth ab him blowing up negatively I wish we could wipe it off the internet too like bruhhhhhh and it looks like people still seriously want him out of the group I thought it would just take a meme direction but the hate is still there
