      <p>since i saw some anons talking about hanbin's idol persona i want to vent a little bit. i'm probably going to sound mean but i'm so fucking tired of his constant fanservice istg... i tried to ignore it since the beginning but it's becoming so fucking unbearable i'm sorry üò≠ i got his bubble for a few months (i'm probably stupid too cause what the hell was i expecting) but him blowing up my phone every single day (and for long periods of time too) with bf-gf roleplay is insufferable... i had to unsubscribe lol. at least the other members are NOT that bad with the fanservice, it's quite average and bearable for me if that makes sense? i just wanted to get to know him more or something bruh i don't want to be your fuckass parasocial girlfriend even though almost everyone enjoys it üò≠ that's why i prefer an idol who might be a bit blunt but still sweet overall (like hao) because at least it feels more genuine to me for some reasons. at this point even hanbin's voice is fake af it's like he's constantly speaking with his customer service voice does he never get tired damn üíÄ i don't doubt he's actually a kind person or whatever and i actually don't feel good about this but i gotta be honest he's giving me the ick so bad especially in some instances where i just have to roll my eyes a little bit i'm sorry lol</p>

      <p>omg diff anon and I never thought someone else felt the same way as me üò≠ don't get me wrong he's in my bias line and the excessive gf fan service was fine at first but it just gets so icky in the long run, like i try not to ignore it cause im not interested in gf stanism (for those who do that's fine i just don't!) but he's also not that funny so it really isn't helping me stay interested in him much longer i feel like I'm forcing myself to stan him atp because he's sweet and talented but I'm sorry it gets so boring and he doesn't give any interesting info about himself or interacts with the fans in a funny way it's always the same damn thing he replies with and I'm like ughhhhh okay anything to else (plz don't kill me I only confessed here cause it's anonymous)</p>

      <p>Your cc is filled with the same exact things rosins were yapping on Twitter to shade Hanbin and defend Hao lmao this is so funny they‚Äôre even acting like this here pretending to be a fan cause if you were actually a fan you‚Äôd know he keeps telling stories every single time. Every live of his is filled with stories about his pre debut stuff, his dancing, stories about the members like he keeps talking on live like an actual friend he was all over the place gushing over Nct after he met them, keeps giving us bts of the events they go to, his mcing stories like are you even fr üíÄ
 Like if you‚Äôre not interested and don‚Äôt like him then just un stan ? But saying ‚Äúomg he‚Äôs my bias‚Äù and then following up with just shady ass para tells a lot</p>

      <p>I think u lot forget i have a mind of my own...? Everything i say is MY opinion unless i state im unsure you also do not see my inbox, most of what I post is digestible and points convos can be built off of. The anon feature hides individuals but i can tell people apart 80% of the time. Regardless of what u think it sounded decently genuine to me and nowhere did they state that hanbins their bias or did they bash him if they feel that way they feel that way not everyone stans people blindly which is a concept you clearly havent heard of. This is seriously the last time im addressing annoying allins if ur so upset or feel some type of way delete my cc from ur history dont come here again and move on. Or just get blocked and ill never see ur ccs again its a fair tradeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>og anon here see this is why i don't even like being in this fandom space anymore you get flamed for even just voicing out your genuine opinion about something and it's part of the reason why i don't even feel interested in hanbin anymore cause this is the way all his fans act, 

first of all i'm not even a rosin anon you just pulled that out of your ass because you can't accept the fact other people do not blindly praise your fav plus losing interest in an idol is so normal and not everyone who slightly disagrees with yall about hanbin is a rosin... i dont have one bias but my bias line in order is gunwook ricky hao hanbin, and i'm sorry but hanbin does do gf fanservice and also his fanservice in general can be cringe and too much sometimes TO ME which is my opinion that i'm entitled to, 
he's not the only one who does it yes i never said that but his is the most awkward for me, plus his i never get his humour which is AGAIN my own damn opinion.

i dont keep up that much with the group anyway but for the things i do  see on my tl from his bubble msgs and some anecdotes i dont find him that interesting anymore and i dont care if you think i'm lying like why would i waste my energy doing something so lame ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

and damn the way you people are part of the reason i'm detaching from him as well and that's sad cause he's been one of my first fav members you just terrorize anyone who doesnt think hanbin is above everyone. anyway bye sorry i dont hate hanbin and never said anything bad about him sorry requeefiem  this is long but i feel really annoyed when someone invalidates my feelings</p>
