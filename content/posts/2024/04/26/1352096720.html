      <p>there's so many factors but essentially yea no one wants to listen it is true that's it's just a pre release with bad promo thus far but we can't say for sure if that's a factor we'd have to see when the actual tt rolls around

      <p>They'll stream so long as Jiwoong isn't pushed or we get Haobin top 4 in everything like I hate to say it but as long as they're not top 4 there, it's gonna be shitter from here. And jiwoong being so pushed doesn't make things better</p>
