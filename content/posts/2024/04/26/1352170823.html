      <p>what did wakeone expect to happen tho? of course its gonna do shit if you dont promote it as well as highlight the wrong people/please the wrong people... its all wakeones fault. this kind of a situation was gonna happen one day. we still have no proper group lives where the fandom can feel united and shit. if anything w1 could maybe focus on japan more like they did with kepler which still makes no sense cause zb1 has alot of kfans. they just have to win them over, knowing wakeone they will be too lazy to do that tho. this company doesnt even know how tiktok/shorts work. their newest shorts on their accounts are shadowbanned cause they spam post shorts on all platforms...</p>

      <p>I get that point but this is probably the most proud all members were and they were the ones who pushed for the song to be a pre release cuz they liked it that muchðŸ˜­ I'm sure they were aware of what lines they had and obviously didn't bother them like we can be disappointed as fans but why are we mad on the behalf of people who enjoy the song? Like yea marketing was shit and everyone's mad about jiwoong but this a bit much. And we're aware how butt they are but they've hired staff in the past few months and there's been changes here and there all I can hope for is that when the merge happens in June we see bigger change. Sweat as a pre release wasn't even supposed to happen I feel like ppl forget that
