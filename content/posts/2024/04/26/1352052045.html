      <p>Why ur anons so dense ðŸ’€ sweat aint charting not because of allins or rosins but because of Jiwoong. His voice annoying to begin with + with scandal the korean general pop don't want to see or hear him and honestly Zeroses too. I mean from what I read most k zeroses are mad he got so many parts despite Wakeone knowing it'll only cause more backlash from the Korean general pop and if you think about it the reason why rosins and allins are fighting is because their parts are given to Jiwoong.

If Wakeone gave Jiwoongs parts to Hao and Hanbin none of this would be happening, we wouldn't be fighting and K general pop would be happy.</p>
