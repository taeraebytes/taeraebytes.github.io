Like yea marketing was shit and everyone's mad about jiwoong but this a bit much. And we're aware how butt they are but they've hired staff in the past few months and there's been changes here and there all I can hope for is that when the merge happens in June we see bigger change. Sweat as a pre release wasn't even supposed to happen I feel like ppl forget that"
