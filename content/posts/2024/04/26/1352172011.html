      <p>I’m pretty sure that SM is doing some voodoo type of shit/spells cause how tf is Riize still on the map with all of their scandals (from druggie sohee to cheating rumors) but Zb1, who just happens to have Jiwoong in the group is getting dropped 😭😭</p>

      <p>big4 company really is a thing like everyone says it all the time but the gravity is so real.... sm is too down and internally dying to try to come for zb1 theyre hybe victims and I'm pretty sure we are too at least media wise. Like I think I said it but hybe had to have at least a pinky in 3/11 4 members involved in scandal in one day IS UNFUCKINGHEARD OF😭
