      <p>I always found it strange that hao in particular has such a crazy parasocial fanbase when he doesn't play into parasocialism nearly as much as the average idol, doesn't really share anything about his life, doesn't seem to even like to be victimized and coddled by his fan base and SHOWS IT, he's a very outspoken direct person..like why are they even like this at all?? 

I wonder if the post finale mess permanently made his fan base much more schizo because they feel like they know him on a very personal level? 
I find the psychology of Stan culture very interesting, it's easier to get the crazy jungkook nicki or Taylor swift fans because the artists play into parasocialsm a lot but it's a lot harder with the bp, aespa or in this case zh schizos</p>

      <p>I think with the whole overprotective attitude and cfan culture kind of spreading thru irosins as a result of his huuuge cfandom mixed with natural solo tendencies from survival show stanning u just kind of have the worst mix. And it's only really with irosins on twitter that I see which is so funny cuz mostly all they do is larpüò≠ both j and krosins are chiller and levelheaded and even if they have qualms it's rarely ever in a public setting and crosins have their own culture that they're used to and use entirely different platforms. And when you're in an environment like that where it's only yes men and like minded ppl only yea u just no longer have a basis in reality even to the point u create an image for ur bias. It's definitely not all rosins there are chill ones but there's an overwhelming almost majority thatre like this so it drowns out normalcy

      <p>the first few months of zb1 rosins were really not this bad i think the whole september issue and ‚Äústanning a foreign idol‚Äù went over their head and made them more overprotective and i think that kind of mindset just never left anymore and they now think everything and everyone is against hao it ºs hard to get out of that cycle tbh stanning bts who were kinda ‚Äúrags to riches‚Äù made me so used to fans making a big deal out of every tiny thing bc they think ‚Äúno one was there for them when they were small but i was so u wouldnt understand‚Äù</p>

      <p>Yea they had a bad run from the beginning I guess it was worse because they were already scared of haos position as center being snatched and I can agree it wasn't being take as seriously in the beginning and wakeone def tried pushing hanbin for the public. In a sense I get he still was dominating domestically but since he was raining #1 until the end the fights between the two fandoms got worse and amplified things. But in general the beginning of zb1 was shit for everyone except for like hanbin and jiwoong and then they used fan reactions to the covid fansign sitch for example to say that not only is the industry against hao the fans are against rosinsüò≠üò≠üò≠ like in general most zeroses and solos and akgaes are new to kpop and it's so fuckinf obvious and zeroses aren't the brightest people so they're not gonna get it right the first time or the second time or the third time even and that just made things how they are now. I try to tell anons honestly just forget 2023 it was SHIT FROM A BUTT and the worst time ever and I was even a solo at some point and I hated everything and I'm sure other people did too but I genuinely think for everyone 2024 is a lot better attitudes are better treatment is better it's not perfect but I think it's possible for the hostility to goüëç that's just me tho I decided I'm gonna enjoy my time so I just let less things bother me
