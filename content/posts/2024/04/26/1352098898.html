      <p>no it’s bc he’s a dozen

jokes aside he’s actually a rly good dancer his footwork is clean and id rank him 3-5 in riize but he’s the least popular and not the best vocalist so they’re prob just like eh let’s throw him in the back. his scandals weren’t proper scandals as much as just internet trolls and he’s always been on the bottom with screen/center time</p>

      <p>they weren't scandals but theyll take a hit to public image it's similar to sunwoo minus the talent and popularity you'll just have easier troll material. I guess he just doesn't have something to build himself with and if sm doesn't care to highlight him then yea
