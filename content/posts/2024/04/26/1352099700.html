Like yeah Jiwoong cursed, but the way it got so much engagement was unheard of like you'd think he killed someone lmao. And no offense i still don't understand how tws song is charting that high. Internationally they didn't make any noise, and even koreans are questioning their charting. Apparently they're popular with kids so i'm waiting to see how their cb do, either they're really lucky or pledis is doing something fishy and Hybe is enabling it.",

They basically did the same kind of marketing with them like they did with lesserafim v aespa and quite literally manipulated their charts. They always generate more negative traction for their rivals as well literally anyone that poses a threat to hybe becomes a victim"
