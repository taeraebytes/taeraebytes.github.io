      <p>i can't believe mhj was able to get kfans on her side after this messy presscon. maybe if wakeone get jiwoong to apologize in front of the press he might be forgiven.</p>

      <p>no because there's reasons she was able to have people sympathize with her she's one person versus a multimillion dollar evil company and she exposed them for sabotaging other groupsðŸ˜­ JIWOONG IS OVER and a press conference would only help a liiiiiiitle if they apologized profusely and even that's risky cuz it could just reignite more hate for admitting it and dragging it on this long the only way is push him to the back or just announce he has a panic disorder from hate
