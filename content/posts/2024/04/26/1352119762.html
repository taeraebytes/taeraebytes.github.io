      <p>i can't believe mhj was able to get kfans on her side after this messy presscon. maybe if wakeone get jiwoong to apologize in front of the press he might be forgiven.</p>

      <p>no because there's reasons she was able to have people sympathize with her she's one person versus a multimillion dollar evil company and she exposed them for sabotaging other groups😭 JIWOONG IS OVER and a press conference would only help a liiiiiiitle if they apologized profusely and even that's risky cuz it could just reignite more hate for admitting it and dragging it on this long the only way is push him to the back or just announce he has a panic disorder from hate

      <p>Wakeone probably will stop caring about domestic reactiions anyways, time is limited and they will honestly fare better being more japanese based like kepler, sorry im a ot9 zerose but the truth is korea doesnt care about them, well gp was never hugely into them but they lost potential to grow to other groups. so its better they focus on releasing englsh single, jp comebacks before domestic promos</p>

      <p>gp never cared ab them cuz gp doesn't care ab kpop in general unless they're veryyyyyyyyy successful zb1s largest fandom is still their korean fandom and by a lot so what's the point of losing out on their biggest market like I don't think u guys realize what ur talking ab 😭😭 zb1 are a domestic group and they're not anywhere near losing their core fandom rn it has genuinely been worse than it is now but fans will retaliate however they feel
