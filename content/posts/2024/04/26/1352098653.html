      <p>How I brutally view the members. Please tell me you agree and that I'm not insane.
1. Hao - skillful, but a little entitled, chin implant galore, can't pull off masc dances and always give off twink (which imo shows lack of variety, serving slay does not mean you shouldn't learn other styles and do those styles passably, don't come for me I'm gay), he's also very aware that his ship with Hanbin is insanely profitable and plays it up for views, he's a koreaboo.
2. Hanbin - repressed, insecure, but deep down genuinely sweet. Too sanitized. Plastic surgery done extremely well. Don't like his upright posture ingrained from his waacking days. I need him to reach a breaking point and act mean for once, it would be hot. Vocals overhyped.
3. Matthew - corny bbl messages, but funny. Feels like sometimes people are laughing at him and not with him so like :/. Singing voice way too nasally but gradual improvement. Good groove when dancing. A good presence in the group, down to earth. Seems the most approachable? 
4. Ricky - very insecure. Quiet but not bland, secretly funny af. Not on the spectrum, dude's just obviously lived in Cali. His style and persona is great marketing and him experimenting with make up means a lot more than most people realize. Needs to chill on chin filler. Very naive. Needs a stronger backbone and needs to set boundaries with Gyuvin. 
5. Gunwook - Depth. Thoughtful and genuinely multitalented. Talks too much at times. More self-conscious than what people think, shakes when nervous. A big portion of his confident bravado is him faking it til making it. Can rub insecure people the wrong away. Female face on male head and body. One of the only male idols I genuinely think can become someone worth admiring. He fascinates me ngl. Don't like the way he stands when presenting stuff, his feet are always pointed too far out.
6. Taerae - Needs to get better at dancing idc, at least don't be noticeably bad when doing group choreo. Very peculiar, conflicted about his personality. His twink moments are funny and he does cares for the members but he's also a clout goblin that would sabotage someone to get ahead, also feels like he would set higher expectations for others than himself. Great singing. Face is objectively cute. 
7. Gyuvin - Good intentions, horrible executions. Doesn't understand boundaries, probably facing the first identity crisis he's ever had rn. Privileged but not cocky. Has potential to grow into someone great. Does have a big heart, just surrounded with naivety. Get better at lipsyncing and singing, and strengthen that core when dancing plz. 
8. Jiwoong - Not even a member at this point, VENEERS, dating some chick. Doesn't even live in the dorms, not mindful of power dynamics with Yujin, and has a weird dancing style that is not adaptable and stands out in a bad way amongst the rest of the group. No facial expressions outside of blank stare and an odd sense of humor (not in a good way).
9. Yujin - that's just nephew</p>

      <p>Ur funny as fuck😭😭😭😭 and why does a lot of this sound like something I would say ugh ur rlly my twin

Hao- lolll agree
Hanbin- oh dang yea agree I'd like to see a multifaceted hanbin too
Matthew- yea he's corny but there's smth about it that makes me😍😍 and agree HES MOSTLY GETTING LAUGHED AT😭 agreeeeeeeee
Ricky- agreeeeeee I don't think Ricky has low autonomy and can think for himself but he's obviously the passive one in the friendship lol but agree
Gunwook- I JUST JUMPED THANK UUUUUU IVE BEEN SAYING HE HAS A GIRL FACEEEE and agree he's a pretty antsy guy but it's impressive how he hides it. And wow agree like this is rlly a star don't dim his light... and yea his overturn when he stands 😭 I wonder if he's flat footed
Taerae- I think yea he's super noticeable but everyone gives him a pass for hard carrying as a main vocal I do too. 😭😭😭😭😭 ehys this description killing me him possibly setting higher standards for others not himself made me laugh
Gyuvin- agreeeeee
Jiwoong- yup and yes I don't wanna accuse him of anything but can this uncle chill on the whole throwing things at yujin bit😅? Agree I need him to stop dancing with his butt and stop the Botox
Yujin- my aegiiiiiiii icl I think he's now my favorite after gunwook it's been a slow rise these past few months

Jiwoong - Unskilled, rude, arrogant and shameless but honestly I wonder if it's a trauma response, I have a lot more empathy for him than most I don't think he even realises when he's being weird or inappropriate, he seems to really struggle socially and it makes me feel bad sometimes, really beautiful though 

Hao - Mostly good looking but he can be hit or miss ngl, his body is tea though, I don't think he's lacking versatility but he does lack power in some moves which is why contemporary and hip hop dance moves fit him better than idol bg strong concept dances, I like him and his personality but he can be careless with his words, I admire his background and resilience and have a lot of respect towards him! He's sometimes too skinny to the point he looks physically sick and it makes the chin more visible, he needs to get more fit

Hanbin - I like him, he is stiff as hell, anxious, insecure and sometimes cringe and corny but he's getting better and the members adore him and that's what matters most. Like hao he can ironically be very careless sometimes with his words when he gets hype despite being pr trained down, sometimes his insecurities shows in his performances which is one of the worst default you can have as a performer but he's much better now, he was great in sweat 

Taerae - I find him very good looking and I love his voice, I don't find his lack of dance skills distracting personally. He gives me bad vibes though , it's not rational and it's not like jiwoong where you actually have some material but he just does give me bad vibes I can't explain and it blocks me from fully liking him

Matthew - I don't mind the cringiness, I really like his personality and bond with his members, he's the yaoi king of zb1, and he seems really mentally healthy, unfortunately I wish I could say the opposite but I am just not attracted to him>< 

Ricky - he is my autistic king I see so much of myself in him..love him down, I do not think he WANTS to have any particular boundaries with gyuvin though I think he genuinely finds him hilarious and loves him, they're like brothers you know, I really like his voice and wish he would at least attempt to sing live sometimes though, second strongest face card in zb1 

Gyuvin- yeah he's ignorant and unskilled but he means well and is trying hard idc idc he is so kind and so full of love nothing could make me dislike him
Also best proportions in zb1 

Gunwook - insecure nice teen but I could see him being a fuck boy in the future sorry..we have similar interests so I would love to talk with him, great face and body and really talented, the most well rounded person in the group by far, I really want a rap track from him, very endearing and seems kind hearted and accepting 

Yujin- kinda bad vibes but great potential and best face card by far</p>

      <p>ok let's dig into this one 

jiwoong- I rmbr someone really did a deep dive into his experiences and his mental and it did make sense I felt bad too and I don't hate him he doesn't rlly do anything of substance he just damages the group 🤦‍♀️ there's no future where he's back to being liked but if he was utilized where he wasn't hated and affected the group we could smile a bit 

Hao- ngl his face is one of my favs but to each their ownnnnn they need to get the filler on his chin right liek stop bloating it!! but lowks it's been looking good and distributed recently I think he can get a bit careless too ig it's his humor with his fans he's smart tho so he can adapt 

Hanbin- yea agree and I think he can get careless too and agree I think he's getting better with his face we're not there yet but hey

Taerae- damn everyone keeps saying this i think him being so blunt and obviously careless in the way he doesn't stop kicking it w evnne even tho ppl get mad just make him come off idk the word but u get what I mean

Matthew- lmaooo I guess its u get ir or u don't 

Ricky- I think he does too but he just seems like the passive one to me which is obvious considering their personalities. And he rlly needs to work on his stamina for that like we could go places lowkey 

Gyuvin- agree ugh that's twin 

Gunwook- u don't know my lover boy... but if that's the case let's tap into an nda 🤫 agree agree agree 

Yujin- nfnrngnntjfjksmdk I think he's a little evil but in the funny little brother way I really fw that and he's kinda blunt too but I've grown to like him a lot that's rlly just nephew

      <p>well regarding taerae I don't think this needs to be a bad thing for him it's really and I mean really important to keep being in contact with his friends and he basically has known and lived together with the evnne wakeones for years he basically raised munjung 😭 I think for him it's more like he won't stop hanging out with him just because kfans are insecure you know I actually think it's like a good thing? why would he let kfans treat him like a doll who bends to their will</p>

      <p>That's not the point nobody says he should stop having his closest friends they just don't wanna hear about it from both sides and both fandoms dislike it not just zeroses
