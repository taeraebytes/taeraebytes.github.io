      <p>I know you don't keep up with the non gunwooks but the mcountdown waiting room was really cute today they brought out taerae so he could meet sohee (they were talking about both of them being ducks and Ts) and taerae was really shy the entire time I haven't seen him being like this since boys planet ðŸ˜­</p>
