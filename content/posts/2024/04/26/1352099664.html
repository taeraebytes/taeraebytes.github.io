      <p>This is funny because if we're being serious hao is a more rounded singer than taerae. People debate on their ranges but he has better technique (taerae often tends to strain and go out of his range when belting and also has a lot of shoulder and neck tension you always see him bending himself in half). Live singing hao is on another level he's the most stable his voice pitch rarely ever wavers while jumping and dancing. Tone obviously subjective.
Just because wakeone doesn't give him many interesting vocal parts doesn't take away from his singing skills</p>

      <p>Based off technique isn't taerae regarded the best? He's the highest member in the kva(?) and he's usually the first in ranking by other vocalists no? Zhanghao definitely has the better stamina and live vocals but taerae usually never sings in range just cuz zb1s song are out of range for almost everyone

      <p>i think both have different styles but taerae is definitely a better vocalist technically and has a wider range. The difference was also evident when both of them sang the chorus of ‚Äúyou were beautiful‚Äù by day6 - taerae was more open, sounded less strained and sang much easily compared to hao.</p>
