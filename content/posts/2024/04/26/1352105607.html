      <p>girflrjrr who's that?? i'd say niki is a good competition he's an incredible dancer and always goes viral on ktwt with his dance challenges i remember when he did the smoke challenge it was a hit and trended in korea saying he did it the best, no one cares about hyunjin and yeonjun well no.</p>

      <p>People think shotaro is automatically a lot better because his dance style isn't rooted in queer culture just being real 
Obviously shotaro is a crazy good hip hop dancer but Hanbin is crazy good in his domain too and is actually decent and even good in several dance styles</p>

      <p>I don't get the argument with other dance styles because technically riizes is hip hop inspired and they're both versatile in the styles similar to their domains one is just commonly used for inspiration
