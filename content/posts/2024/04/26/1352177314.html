    "question": "It's gonna be awkward as fuck for them if mhj wins the possible future lawsuit they might get slandered and blacklist, if she loses they'll lose their main creative director and probably ton of their staff and will work under a ceo that doesn't like them and will be autotuned down\n\nI personally was a bit disappointed w their first mini but I feel bad for them they're so young",
    "reply": "I feel bad too but since hybe was never a big founding company that has their own beef with som broadcast stations they can't do a blacklist like sm or yg at their heights. In general new jeans never relied on things like music shows or variety so it's possible for them to stay on top. Hybe dabbles in manipulation media play and buying opportunities and new jeans got as popular as they were faked to be so they should still have opportunities they'll be aight I hope. I'm praying for hybe to lose but realistically since they still have majority shares for ador idk if winning public sentiment helps mhj unless she enters a lawsuit which..... I mean she will lose 100% its an individual vs a multimillion entity"
