      <p>LMAO they have jiwoong so the chances are high but since MC is cringe and extremely weird as hell so chances are 50-50 because they also have yujin who is minor</p>

      <p>idt him liking that necessarily means anything.... idk what it is but i've noticed korean public figures just seem to like every damn comment on their own youtube, instagram or tiktok. maybe it's to show they've seen the message but ppl always act like it's a huge thing and then you'll see they've liked every comment so it means nothing. she's not korean but it reminds me of when yurina from gp999 liked a rude comment on tiktok, forgot the context but anyway she got lots of shit but clearly she or her social media manager was liking just about anything</p>

      <p>I think this is probably it he's expressed his like for hanbin before and even held that weird lecture ab boys planet so it doesn't indicate anything i dont think
