      <p>Sorry I'm going through the zb1 Tumblr tag lol but here's mattwook ideal types according to a tarot reader;
Gunwook
Personality: queen of wands, 7 of swords, the high priestess
He could be a bit impressionable and naive in relationships, because he tends to be attracted to tricksters, people who hide their true self or true intentions, who appear to him as very charismatic and over the top, could love bomb him. People with narcissistic tendencies, who could try to gaslight him so they have him under their influence. People who talk a lot of BS, who lie or distort the truth, exaggerate things to make themselves appear more impressive. People who can be domineering and arrogant, who donâ€™t take no for an answer. 
negative sagittarius, leo, gemini, cancer, scorpio

Appearance: king of cups, queen of swords, 10 of pentacles
He is easily impressed by status, money or a strong, intimidating aura. Someone who could even look a bit fierce, cold, mean, but who has very magnetic intense eyes. A touch of darkness in their aesthetic. Luxurious brands, jewelry. Could prefer older partners. Someone who looks a bit extravagant or who has a signature sort of look. This could be a specific energy Iâ€™ve been picking up for him since the start of the reading. 
taurus, capricorn, scorpio

Matthew
Personality: knight of swords, 6 of wands, 9 of swords
He likes people who he can get a strong reaction from. People who are a bit impulsive, easily triggered, whose emotions run high, even people who can worry easily, people who enjoy attention and who are a bit proud. I think itâ€™s because he enjoys teasing them, and he likes when someone responds to him. Someone quick to react, with a rather active mind. Active body too, someone more action oriented. Who enjoys activities and going out. Someone who can be really fun too. He likes this bickering old couple sort of dynamic.
aries, leo, gemini, virgo, sagittarius
Appearance: queen of swords, 2 of swords, the tower
Someone quite intimidating, haughty, who could even look a bit mean. When it comes to outer appearance very elegant, sophisticated and stylish. But you can feel passion and even aggression boiling just under the surface. The type who can be an ice queen most of the time and throw big tantrums from time to time. Something a bit explosive about their aura. They are trying to keep it under control but you can feel they are triggered. XD Lots of jewelry and luxurious items. Rather tall or appears tall. Pouty lips, that sort of Bratz doll mouth.
aries, leo, libra, scorpio, mars
