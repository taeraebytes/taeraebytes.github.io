    "reply": "ok i dont think its as drastic as that you can tell he has a love for promoting it just seems like hes in a slump tbh even just how he appears to me in content and fan videos is different i think bro i depressed or smth. but regardless his communication is a concern amongst fans rn i feel like at least fixing it is a step into becoming more comfortable as an idol but idk hes still stuck on the mystery barely there presence thing idk"
