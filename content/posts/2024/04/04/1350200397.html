      <p>Okay zb1 as content creators
Jiwoong does those Facebook dad thirst type tiktoks like it's in black and white he use the SO WHY DOO GOOD GIRLS LIKE BAAD GUYS song and has the devil horns filter, he likes comments that are like he is for the booktok girlies😍

Hao has a very small acc he does Kpop dance covers sometimes and films the food he eats, in our zb1 americanverse maybe he also posts his musical performance and talks about the need for Puerto Rican Chinese rep, maybe he also drops occasional pop girls commentaries 

Hanbin posts very popular dance videos obvs but also talks about Taylor Swift, like he'd gag over anything she does real bad and maybe he'd be a Gaylor🤔he also would do tons of povs in 2020 like a world where you get your soulmate mark at 16 but my soulmate is the mafia boss 😞

Matthew would be popular in a particular community like he'd be a genshin or valorant cc and he'd collab w taerae, some of his cringe clips get viral but it only helps him build his 🥺 comfort streamer❤️ fanbase even more, collabs w Taerae a lot and their yaoi bait moments get clipped and get lots of views

Taerae is a cat femboy vtuber, he makes money by doing a lot of sex jokes and yaoi bait however he also has some really good song covers 

Gyuvin street interviews

Gunwook twitch streamer, he gets attacked by some of the big streamers fanbase because he got in some drama w them like ninja or something but now he's in a happy little streamer friend group w mattrae and they make cashew people see him as a good looking unproblematic streamer he gets tons of hits tiktoks, he they

Ricky would be part of a TikTok house, would go to a TikTok rizz party, also runs a famous Lebron fanpage on the low where he calls every other players frauds

Yujin Korean if star idk</p>
