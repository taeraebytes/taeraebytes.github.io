      <p>I read outsidereveries’ tumblr tarot reading and got reminded but I kinda feel bad for Zhang Hao like that guy is too dedicated to his group. He was being interviewed by like vogue(?) for a short segment at the Loewe exhibition thing and even then he was promoting their japan debut song, back when I was into zb1 I remember he even promoted in bloom during his birthday live. like boy you doing all this and I’m sorry but zeroses do not like you 😭😭</p>

      <p>Who told you zeroses don't like him..? Yes they do another thing solos need to understand akgae wars are a reflection of internet fights which news flash is inevitable for rank 1 and rank 2 fans cmon hao is loved and probably the most popular member that's just not true but good for him

      <p>Literally like he's the most stanned of the group haobin are the most loved and defended members by far see how everybody was defending Hao the last 2 days and Hanbin today but no one but their fans defended Matthew and Jiwoong? You guys always want to be victims 🤦‍♀️</p>
