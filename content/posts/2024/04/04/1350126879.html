      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's definitely not gonna be as successful as he was as a zb1 member it depends on what he goes into I don't think he's redebuting in a group no shade he's flopping as a soloist and probablt as an actor too but if he becomes like a variety personality and furthers his dance career he could be fine and this is my most optimistic vision
