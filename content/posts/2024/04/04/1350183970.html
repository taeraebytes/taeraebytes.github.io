      <p>Not the same anon but in late October I read one that said they were exhausted and homesick and kept getting irked by each other because they're so tired ðŸ˜­but they said it's only in passing and they'll feel better after a break also I have no proof but the members who got irked by the others are taerae Ricky Yujin Jiwoong and maybe Gyuvin</p>

      <p>you missed the great psychoanalysis of December sis I'm sorry but basically it was just so obvious on gyuvins end he didn't fw jiwoong it was more obvious w hao like those two never laughed at what he said would visibly show on their faces when he would bait with them softly shoot his advances down and there's a reason for hao iirc jiwoong was going ab how he talks too much and would air him on his show like "do you like me now" or smrh along those lines that's just what we see but gyuvin looked irl overall like when he got irked at Ricky for his mistake in first takeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
