      <p>I am not blaming you or telling you to stop, but seeing someone say that you have changed the way they look at hanbin, that's why I have to write that. Imo, micro-analysing someone's character is kind of problematic because unknowingly, you might end up influencing someone's perspective about some other person without noticing when you don't even know that person. Also, since both of us are muslims, even though I sometimes fall victim to the same sin, actually making assumptions about someone even though you know them, is a big sin.
Also, the people who met hanbin's mom, irl, said that he and his mom have the same type of character, so who knows, maybe he has always been the same</p>

      <p>i get this sentiment and i feel bad whenever i see that i always always urge everyone to think for themselves because thats what i do. For the most part my anons can recognize we are trolling almost all the time and just having fun but there are people who can feel impacted. at the end of the day these shared opinions and convos are just that, opinions and convos and i make it pertinent in the language i use that everything i say is an opinion or a joke. Most of the conversations here lean towards regular convos kpop fans would have with each other like discussing notes, lines, deals, dynamics, songs etc. like the psychoanalysing is fun but i cant control what the hundreds of people that read my cc think. And yes assumptions are bad but that dips into almost every aspect of being a kpop fan which would make everything about it bad ðŸ˜­ im not gonna get into the politics of that but not to mention pointing out observations can change the way things look (like the anons who started the jiwoong beef convos i wouldve never noticed cuz i didnt see it but that doesnt mean im going around saying they hate each other and this is my proof) but thats because they add nuance if someone thinks their opinions changed its because theres capacity for that. i feel like responsibility for that is too broad to place on my discussions and this is us as fans in our own spaces its not like we know any of these idols. im not trying to dismiss u but im tired of being responsible for how everyone else feels or act when im very clear with my words reading is a skill we should all have
