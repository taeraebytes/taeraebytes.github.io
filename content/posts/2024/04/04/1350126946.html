      <p>og anon who tried to vent yesterday about my personal feelings with hanbin, first of all i'm sorry requeefiem i didn't know they would use my words to try and attack you

as far as i can remember i didn't say anything bad or mean about hanbin or forced my own opinion down anyone's throat. also i didn't say anything bad about him "being too kind" i literally. just shared how i feel about his excessive FAN service from a FAN perspective, and how i don't find him interesting anymore which is my own opinion that's not hurting anyone, and i'm not changing it any time soon especially if you keep twisting people's words because you're too out of touch with reality and too deep in the kpop parasocialism to understand it's not any fan's fault for not finding an idol interesting or unstanning them.

anyway i'm keeping this short and i'm not apologizing for my own opinion, and i want to tell allindans way to go to run people away from hanbin even more üëèüëè like i said he was one of my fav members at first and i had many irl friends and some moots who unstanned him or felt the same way gradually from debut till now so i'm clearly not the only one who feels this way and you people's attitudes is one of the main reasons.  

p.s: i'm not a fucking rosin stop calling me that just because i like hao this is irrelevant to my opinion about your fav. bye</p>

      <p>No hehe it's okay I fought for freedom of speech!!!! Plus I left my zerosetwt accs there's nothing to expose im not there anymoreüò≠

I wish ppl would understand everyone is different and not everyone consumes content like an opinionless monkey like we're stanning people at the end of the day not gods. exactly exactly exactly 

Period and they're not realizing the hostile environments they create turn people away??? Like one of the biggest reasons I became indifferent towards hanbin was because my bias was getting attacked unprovoked and when smth was said ur treated like a criminal. 

And the akgaes are trying to run a narrative they're even calling me a rosin. I got so many ccs saying u and the other anons are undercover rosins like news flash not everyone is a mindless minion to stanning üò±

      <p>lmao they got mad at me bc i dropped hanbin when the racism over there has gotten so bad i felt unsafe as a chinese fan‚Ä¶ like all this self victimisation is insane maybe hold your fellow fans accountable for being sinophobic scum first before you moan and groan about other subfandoms üò≠</p>
