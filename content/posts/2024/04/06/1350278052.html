      <p>Someone needs to tell jb1 about the side effects of plastic surgery because hao's chin only looks good in certain angles and ricky's filler was migrated down his neck making it look like he has a double chin, don't play with your faces kid</p>

      <p>allins pls dont expose queefy again for what I'm about to say but hanbin chin is oddly square? It's so weird like it's clearly not an implant but idk why it just looks so unnatural. That video of him eating an egg is ingrained into my head</p>
