      <p>Tbh i already had a feeling Wakeone would slowly give up managing on zb1, they've lost a lot of artists and trainees recently and it doesnt look sustainable for them to manage zb1, this merger' isnt gonna last i see wakeione completely dropping out or zb1 getting a whole new subsidiary outisde of swing too (swing has had their fair share of mgmt issues in the past too)</p>

      <p>No company is good my thing is I just don't think it's going to get any worse than it is but I feel like wakeone we're trying their best? Like it's very evident the difference in quality between now and at debut

      <p>why wouldn’t it be sustainable? wouldn’t it just mean more time and staff they can put into zb1? + they’re their main moneymaker. it’s kinda pointless to think whether it’d get better or worse cos they’re both cj, it’s been cj influenced before it’ll still be cj influenced then.</p>
