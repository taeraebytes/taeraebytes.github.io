      <p>It genuinely makes me tweak when Ricky posts these cringe ass tiktoks cus yeah he wants to do them but he’s so obviously just trying to push the over the top image that he’s just cosplaying as 🤦🏻‍♀️ I wish he realised people like him for him better than they do this ideal version of a eboy he tries to make himself like yeah it’s style but it’s also the repeated habits he does which he thinks r “cool” THEYRE NOT</p>
