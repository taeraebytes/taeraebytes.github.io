      <p>There's nothing to break because not fitting the beauty standard has never been a clear marker of attractiveness or not? Please save this bullshit for someone u can upset and get real gunwooks visuals were received well for his special mcing on emka. ive looked at the mc history of every music show and this narrative u so badly wanna push just isn't sticking because the proof is very clearly in the pudding😭😭😭 not to mention the standards of today were not the standards a decade ago like you need to see how stupid u look dickriding arbitrary korean beauty standards as a foreigner who's never touched the country like how are y'all Korean supremacists and not even Korean DFKM😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

      <p>so you would choose yujin over gunwook for mcing because you said he fits the beauty standard more.. ok so since when has that ever been a criteria for mcing? While yujin has 0 mc or talking skills alright bruh you're just being dumb on purpose😭😭😭😭😭

      <p>No I'm talking about Yujin, since they are only taking about his visual. Gunwook is a performer so modeling would be second choice for him.</p>

      <p>dangggggg i already said this like 4 times so lying ab heights its very common in kpop unless someone looks tall or clearly over 180cm theyre buffing. you can automatically take 2-3 cm off anyone specifically male idols and especially them for that fact. so for zb1 gyuwooks heights are definitely real rickys im questioning i guess he just has a small frame and hao is 180 everyone else is lying. matthew is probably like 168cm and taerae is like 170-171 making yujin 176 and jiwoong 175 and hanbin 177. its pretty obvious when u pay attention to their heights and proportions and ive seen them irl. jiwoong shocked me the most hes genuinely short af

      <p>Ricky def aint lying he measured down to the decimal 183.9 I think it was and I think Gyuvin and Gunwook just grew since BP so now Ricky is shorter than them both but he's def 183.9 or w,e it is. 

Also watch this I finally found a video of zb1 and rice together in a straight line and at like 1 min in Ricky is even taller than anton whos '186'. I wanted to see Gunwook compared to them but he was standing further back so it wouldn't be accurate but Ricky is literally standing side by side so his comparison would be the most accurate.
