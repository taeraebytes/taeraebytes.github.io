      <p>hi I heard something about Ricky not having a dad on twitter and was wondering if you knew anything else about that? I know about his Irvine friends not rocking with him much and that he got really bad grades in school but what's the stuff about his dad? And the stuff about his siblings not talking to him either?</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ pretty much that hs dad is absent its just rumor and speculation but it seems likely ppl think that his dad never actually lived with them in america and stayed in china and the sibling thing is back when we thought he had 3 siblings he doesnt its just jessica and theyre close

      <p>I'm not sure why you all take everything on Twitter so seriously when during BP, people were spreading rumors that Yujin's father is a garbage collector, Yujin comes from a poor family, and he begged clothes from Gyuvin, and people were telling a whole ass narrative about how a poor child like Yujin is going to lift his family out of poverty. Yujin's mother is beautiful, do you think she will marry a garbage collector? ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­</p>
