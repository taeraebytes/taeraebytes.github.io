      <p>I think they're going with pure visuals only because leeseo also isn't a good mc I would've picked rei or yujin, they're gonna be an awkward duo lol I'm still seated tho</p>

      <p>it's a little crazy how he's met idols from 2nd to 5th gen, from all groups and still hasnt really gained any significant popularity or new fans i think these jobs that give so much exposure should go to idols with interesting and funny personalities and not idols who do nothing but suck up to whoever they meet cuz they have nothing interesting to say like</p>
