      <p>Tbh i already had a feeling Wakeone would slowly give up managing on zb1, they've lost a lot of artists and trainees recently and it doesnt look sustainable for them to manage zb1, this merger' isnt gonna last i see wakeione completely dropping out or zb1 getting a whole new subsidiary outisde of swing too (swing has had their fair share of mgmt issues in the past too)</p>
