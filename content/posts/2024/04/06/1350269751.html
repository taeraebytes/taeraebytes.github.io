      <p>MCA got themselves a decent rapper dancer vocalist trio & upgraded their content 
It's a good opportunity that promote them every week even better than their loser agencies  & provide them exposure between different kpop fandoms 
so really hanbin really is thriving there the rest of the fandom simply don't follow up with him</p>

      <p>There's no spike in popularity other than zeroses liking jaehyun ðŸ˜­ ngl, I actually liked jaehyun from before since he looks so attractive in that fansign with the lollipop but after knowing how he is in mca, I dropped him real fast and unfollowed his twt fan acc page ðŸ˜­ 

He was supposed to be the attractive one</p>
