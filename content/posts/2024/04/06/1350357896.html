      <p>hi I heard something about Ricky not having a dad on twitter and was wondering if you knew anything else about that? I know about his Irvine friends not rocking with him much and that he got really bad grades in school but what's the stuff about his dad? And the stuff about his siblings not talking to him either?</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ pretty much that hs dad is absent its just rumor and speculation but it seems likely ppl think that his dad never actually lived with them in america and stayed in china and the sibling thing is back when we thought he had 3 siblings he doesnt its just jessica and theyre close
