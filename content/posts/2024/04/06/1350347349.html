      <p>Yes they were they were spreading certain members resigning with wakeone so I wouldnâ€™t believe half the shit they say anyway ntm crosins lie so bad on other members and I rosins donâ€™t take a second to critically think about it and start spreading it like itâ€™s the truth. Where do you think the rumor of certain members resigning started from.</p>

      <p>But the information about yujin resigning was from kside and yujin's chinese fans were told so they could prepare. Well they were preparing for yujin to be yuehuaz center when they redebut since hao is definitely going to be the leader or go solo. But the resigning brings new complications because wk1 will push him to be the center since he's the most popular among the members rumored to be resigning. The rumored members were also seen having dinner with wk1 ceo. gunwook & yujin even have video. rosins probably got the info from yujin's chinese fans and when crush happened where yujin centered, they were pissed & leaked it. funny</p>

      <p>thats not at all what happened the rumor sprouted about 2-3 months after the video which was during mama when they were both minors. Why would yujin and gunwook discuss resigning with wakeone in japan??? im not sure ab how it sprouted for yujin but the rumor came from weibo somewhere around a week before yura yura and it was an obvious rage rumor created by rosins who used screentime as a justifier. and there is never ever contract discussions at the very beginning of survival show groups thats not how it works

      <p>That's not true lol diff anon but the rumor came from yujin's fans (idk if it's k or c fans), they were keeping it on the low and I guess rosin schizos found out and used it to explain why wk1 is pushing yujin. it doesn't make sense saying they created the rumor because why would they include gunwook or matthew with the members re-signing when they dgaf about them (matthew is getting pushed by wk1 but not gunwook so it doesn't make sense). The rumor started from yujin fans but idk where they got it from it doesn't seem credible but I definitely see yujin and hanbin re-signing with wk1</p>

      <p>resigning after disbandment. it means, they're still under their respective labels until disbandment then hanbin, yujin, gunwook and Matthew re-signs with wakeone. there's a rumor that they will go with zerobaseone name because why not. wk1 owned the name and at least 5 of 9 are going to be the members still</p>

      <p>if they make a diet zb1 and add evnne i would shoot myself but well see theres like 0 grounds to this rumor and the justification doesnt even apply to gunwook he hasnt got shit ðŸ˜­ but well see and using the name again is a business move even a toddler wouldnt make this still sounds like an insecurity from one specific sf
