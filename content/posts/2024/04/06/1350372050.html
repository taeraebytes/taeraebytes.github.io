      <p>hi I heard something about Ricky not having a dad on twitter and was wondering if you knew anything else about that? I know about his Irvine friends not rocking with him much and that he got really bad grades in school but what's the stuff about his dad? And the stuff about his siblings not talking to him either?</p>

      <p>😭😭😭 pretty much that hs dad is absent its just rumor and speculation but it seems likely ppl think that his dad never actually lived with them in america and stayed in china and the sibling thing is back when we thought he had 3 siblings he doesnt its just jessica and theyre close

      <p>I don't know if it counts as tea but when Boy Planet first started, someone claims to be ricky's middle school classmate asked why his family let him become an idol when they were in the military. His grandfather and uncle were military and his father is a business man. In China, people in the military and their families are kept anonymous, and based on comments, his uncle is a very high ranking official in China's navy and his father is involved with Alibaba. The comment was immediately deleted, but if his father really has two wives with many children and his family is in the military, it is understandable that he cannot share anything.</p>
