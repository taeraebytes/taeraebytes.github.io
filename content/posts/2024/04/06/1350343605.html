      <p>Yes they were they were spreading certain members resigning with wakeone so I wouldnâ€™t believe half the shit they say anyway ntm crosins lie so bad on other members and I rosins donâ€™t take a second to critically think about it and start spreading it like itâ€™s the truth. Where do you think the rumor of certain members resigning started from.</p>

      <p>But the information about yujin resigning was from kside and yujin's chinese fans were told so they could prepare. Well they were preparing for yujin to be yuehuaz center when they redebut since hao is definitely going to be the leader or go solo. But the resigning brings new complications because wk1 will push him to be the center since he's the most popular among the members rumored to be resigning. The rumored members were also seen having dinner with wk1 ceo. gunwook & yujin even have video. rosins probably got the info from yujin's chinese fans and when crush happened where yujin centered, they were pissed & leaked it. funny</p>

      <p>thats not at all what happened the rumor sprouted about 2-3 months after the video which was during mama when they were both minors. Why would yujin and gunwook discuss resigning with wakeone in japan??? im not sure ab how it sprouted for yujin but the rumor came from weibo somewhere around a week before yura yura and it was an obvious rage rumor created by rosins who used screentime as a justifier. and there is never ever contract discussions at the very beginning of survival show groups thats not how it works

      <p>also i think i missed the part where wk1 is pushing hanbin as the center, not yujin so his fans are pissed again. when the yuehuaz were called to yuehua, it was announced there about yujin. yujin's parents were involved. but for gunwook, not sure</p>
