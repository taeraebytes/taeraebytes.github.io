      <p>It genuinely makes me tweak when Ricky posts these cringe ass tiktoks cus yeah he wants to do them but he’s so obviously just trying to push the over the top image that he’s just cosplaying as 🤦🏻‍♀️ I wish he realised people like him for him better than they do this ideal version of a eboy he tries to make himself like yeah it’s style but it’s also the repeated habits he does which he thinks r “cool” THEYRE NOT</p>

      <p>ok i feel like people are gonna get me for this but ricky just seems insecure in general and super self conscious even when they’re doing silly games and stuff he always has to make sure he looks cool for the camera while the other members are relaxed and having fun, not that ricky doesn’t have fun but you can just always see him occupied with his image idk. and i get why he would be stressed about it because of what he’s gone through so i don’t blame him but idk i just wish we could see him relax more and just be goofy like it’s ok if you’re not serving face 24/7</p>
