      <p>Yes they were they were spreading certain members resigning with wakeone so I wouldnâ€™t believe half the shit they say anyway ntm crosins lie so bad on other members and I rosins donâ€™t take a second to critically think about it and start spreading it like itâ€™s the truth. Where do you think the rumor of certain members resigning started from.</p>

      <p>But the information about yujin resigning was from kside and yujin's chinese fans were told so they could prepare. Well they were preparing for yujin to be yuehuaz center when they redebut since hao is definitely going to be the leader or go solo. But the resigning brings new complications because wk1 will push him to be the center since he's the most popular among the members rumored to be resigning. The rumored members were also seen having dinner with wk1 ceo. gunwook & yujin even have video. rosins probably got the info from yujin's chinese fans and when crush happened where yujin centered, they were pissed & leaked it. funny</p>

      <p>thats not at all what happened the rumor sprouted about 2-3 months after the video which was during mama when they were both minors. Why would yujin and gunwook discuss resigning with wakeone in japan??? im not sure ab how it sprouted for yujin but the rumor came from weibo somewhere around a week before yura yura and it was an obvious rage rumor created by rosins who used screentime as a justifier. and there is never ever contract discussions at the very beginning of survival show groups thats not how it works

      <p>Wrong. i saw the rumor about yujin came out last year in korean side before crush. probably october. chinese rosins heard abouf it from yujin's chinese fans so when crush came out, it was like the confirmation.the additional 2 which are gunwook & matthew came out early january & the twitter posts from jan 26 to march 9 kinda confirmed who are not signing. then came the frequent schedules of matthew, gunwook, yujin. hanbin is always the one with the most schedules so nothing is new.the yura yura promotion is just another confirmation that there are members being pushed.well,let's just be glad that gunwook is at least one of them. he has been getting more lines.</p>

      <p>gunwook isn't the most popular in japan. ijbol! his albums offline and online aren't selling well compared to others. unless his japanese fans are poor af. compared to the period before the rumor came out, gunwook is treated better now by wk1. i think, resigning with wk1 under zb1 name is the best decision for him because going back to jelpi with nothing buy uncertainty is way worse. at least,his future is secured for the next 7 years.</p>

      <p>yes he is thats not up for debate maybe second if ur a rosin trying to argue but again sales have never been much of a fame marker just sf bulk purchase power and ps his offline albums did well. but anyways thats not happening BECAUSE ITS NOT like once again a rumor is a RUMOR unless u got a document that his this groups life plan on it theres no reason to be talking with this conviction ðŸ˜­

      <p>I must admit that Hao is super popular in Japan. His MAMA helped him a lot and you can see how his Jfans dominate X looking for his photocards and bulk buying don't work much in Japan. But Gunwook is crazy popular too and Lapone is aware of it. Hao and Gunwook having the most lines in Yurayura makes sense.</p>

      <p>yea saying gunwook isnt popular is just incorrect thats why the whole rumor doesnt rlly stick to me just cuz it makes sense theyd have the most and theyre being co-managed for jpn releases not just wakeone
