      <p>There's nothing to break because not fitting the beauty standard has never been a clear marker of attractiveness or not? Please save this bullshit for someone u can upset and get real gunwooks visuals were received well for his special mcing on emka. ive looked at the mc history of every music show and this narrative u so badly wanna push just isn't sticking because the proof is very clearly in the pudding😭😭😭 not to mention the standards of today were not the standards a decade ago like you need to see how stupid u look dickriding arbitrary korean beauty standards as a foreigner who's never touched the country like how are y'all Korean supremacists and not even Korean DFKM😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

      <p>so you would choose yujin over gunwook for mcing because you said he fits the beauty standard more.. ok so since when has that ever been a criteria for mcing? While yujin has 0 mc or talking skills alright bruh you're just being dumb on purpose😭😭😭😭😭

      <p>No I'm talking about Yujin, since they are only taking about his visual. Gunwook is a performer so modeling would be second choice for him.</p>

      <p>5'11..? He's 176😭 he can grow but he probably won't grow much esp if he's dieting it'll stunt him

      <p>dangggggg i already said this like 4 times so lying ab heights its very common in kpop unless someone looks tall or clearly over 180cm theyre buffing. you can automatically take 2-3 cm off anyone specifically male idols and especially them for that fact. so for zb1 gyuwooks heights are definitely real rickys im questioning i guess he just has a small frame and hao is 180 everyone else is lying. matthew is probably like 168cm and taerae is like 170-171 making yujin 176 and jiwoong 175 and hanbin 177. its pretty obvious when u pay attention to their heights and proportions and ive seen them irl. jiwoong shocked me the most hes genuinely short af
