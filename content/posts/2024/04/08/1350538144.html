      <p>ok so basically you know how Korean votes weight more than int votes? Well basically since they do some math and they are like ok the more international votes, the more the korean votes are going to weight and GP was a flop in korea so the korean votes were crazy, then during the finale some Koreans saw that the foreigners were always ranking high and the korean girlies were flopping so they were like yeah no we need to vote for the finale, they voted like crazy and since k-fans favorite was chaehyun she won and the foreigner girlies ended up being last</p>
