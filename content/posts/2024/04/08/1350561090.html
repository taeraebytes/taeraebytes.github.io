      <p>I voted during gp and yeah the final's votes ratio are crazy, it's 8:1 afaik, it's basically rigging, if the ratio was 50:50 like bp chaehyun will not be the center, maybe it'll be bahiyyih</p>

      <p>I heard they waited until xiaoting was in the lineup to close the voting too ðŸ˜­ like imagine if she didn't make it when she's undoubtedly the best trainee there</p>

      <p>i remember the theory that they didnâ€™t post p9 candidates this year bc p9 was yujin and jay was p10 so they didnâ€™t want ifans to panick vote him into the group</p>

      <p>Voting was closed by the time they started announcing it was cuz the new child labor laws and ppl also thought they didn't want to make it stressful and went thru it rlly quick because of the news of moonbins passing
