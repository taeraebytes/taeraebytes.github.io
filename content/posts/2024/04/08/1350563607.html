Had they deleted it quickly those same people would've gave them death threats and it would just look like they're shielding yada yada yada like in general idt anyone would've known what to do and they apologized so I think it's unfair to label them as antis or give them slack for something as dumb as the fubao comment"

      <p>he sent his dog’s photo baobao and bbo contexted it as fubao the panda. this made rosins angry cos he sent like 3? photos way earlier in the day and the name baobao even trended like #5 on ktwt. and he sent another photo again at night awhile ago with the msg baobao. He’s also mentioned those names like multiple times before. and given bbo’s track record w him + them insisting on being ot9, not knowing who baobao is probably triggered the trauma again. Also bubblebaseone is just dumb like the man sent like 5 dog photos consecutively before that baobao name drop and you think he’s talking about a panda???</p>

      <p>Ok so their only crime is being dumb they corrected it quickly so idgi😭😭😭😭😭😭 this isn't rage worthy tbh. And the track record is the Starbucks issue which is a political and genocidal topic i feel like there needs to be an understanding on the admins part like im sure that these admins are teens or young adults who weren't sure how to go about it and weren't trying to get hao dragged. It would look like they were shielding or were insensitive and they released a statement(I think) like ppl make mistakes and I think it was a fan gift? Idk topics like this are always met with outrage for ppl to act like it came out of nowhere or out of a place of rage for hao makes no sense to me
