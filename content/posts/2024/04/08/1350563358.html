      <p>he sent his dogâ€™s photo baobao and bbo contexted it as fubao the panda. this made rosins angry cos he sent like 3? photos way earlier in the day and the name baobao even trended like #5 on ktwt. and he sent another photo again at night awhile ago with the msg baobao. Heâ€™s also mentioned those names like multiple times before. and given bboâ€™s track record w him + them insisting on being ot9, not knowing who baobao is probably triggered the trauma again. Also bubblebaseone is just dumb like the man sent like 5 dog photos consecutively before that baobao name drop and you think heâ€™s talking about a panda???</p>

      <p>Ok so their only crime is being dumb they corrected it quickly so idgiðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ this isn't rage worthy tbh. And the track record is the Starbucks issue which is a political and genocidal topic i feel like there needs to be an understanding on the admins part like im sure that these admins are teens or young adults who weren't sure how to go about it and weren't trying to get hao dragged. It would look like they were shielding or were insensitive and they released a statement(I think) like ppl make mistakes and I think it was a fan gift? Idk topics like this are always met with outrage for ppl to act like it came out of nowhere or out of a place of rage for hao makes no sense to me

      <p>it's an ot9 account with more than one admin, with a 100k+ followers,  not a random zerose that rosins randomly decided to attack cause they didn't know something about hao. and this isn't the first time they provide shit translation and context that could get him dragged especially given how he's being treated like a target rn by fuckass knets and to top it all off, they can't even post an apology or acknowledge their shortcoming as a big account hope they keep getting bullied let people complain</p>

      <p>we're aware of the shit translations but they're doing this for free one of the only big group pages and at least the updates are timely? again this is a group there are better solo bubble accs but it's difficult to stan a group if everything is separate???? Also this is ENGLISH knetz have nothing to do with this and they corrected themselves in a timely manner seriously what more do u want. why the fuck would they apologize for a context issue that wasn't even a big deal yall seriouslt make nothing into something

      <p>Oh no they're mid we all know but it's whatever they're getting a little better it's just kind of the prose of being a big ot9 acc that keeps them going. Like they are our biggest group page and it's a bubble acct does no one find that weird it just reflects the state of the fandom imo like everything is separate
