      <p>Hao posted a bubble message saying it will be great if bao bao also travel to kr, bb1 added a note saying it was about fubao then rosins jumped them saying it was about hao’s dog. I think it was an honest mistake though because I didn’t even know he had a dog and fubao did literally just leave korea like the other day.</p>
