      <p>Zb1 are so doomed riize keeps getting hit tweets every day because they're promoted so well, they get to go on actually hyped shows because of payola pre-release with full promotion one month ahead meanwhile wakeone dropped one mv teaser and called it a day for a whole pre-release not even a single d-day poster

God fuck CJ I can't even refute ppl saying that they're going down kep1er route anymore</p>

      <p>do u know how irked u gotta make me to come out of my lock in break🤦‍♀️ yea idk what world u live in but the past month has been pretty amazing for zb1 engagement wise, just their Antwerp performance alone was amazing they easily had some of the best engagements and talk ab their performance out of the entire lineup😭😭😭 and the prerelease roll out is disappointing but I've seen worse.. and not to mention since ur so tapped into other groups to compare them to zb1 riize also have a shit rollout like you'll live it's not the actual tt. And I'm confused... did taerae not just book an ost for probably the biggest kdrama out rn??? Ur worried about a show that doesn't even pull 500k views with popular guests 😭😭 and I'm cool off that. Like idk what ur calling doomed this probably the littest zb1 have been since September ugh please take that energy somehwere elseeee like wakeone is finally turning things around ur such a party pooper EAT UR FUCKING FOOD🤬🖕

      <p>Right I haven't seen consistent hit tweets in a while it's evident their core fandom grew so I hope at least the tt will make everyone happy enough to stream well

      <p>As someone who dabbles more on Kzerose side mostly zeroses there are young, and the younger they are the less likely they care about scandals, flopping they just put their 100% into stanning and theres defo been increase in them. downside kind of like intl zerose on titkok they never stop talking about disbandment. the older zeroses mostly stan haobin or are solos and portion hate jiwoong and care a lot about how well they do. i feel like out of all demographics jzeroses have least drama and maybe the most growth theyve been getting hit ater hit tweets since yura yura</p>

      <p>Yuppppp and I think it's good they're starting to take a younger turn they support in ways adults can with online promo and streaming and I doubt they'll ever lose their established older fandom that contributes to sales and concerts but yea j zeroses seem the happiest

      <p>oh really? I was hoping that would be the case the performance video rlly highlights how even the lines are and honestly im ok with that like there's nothing wrong with a promoted bside highlighting everyone decently my qualms save for jiwoong screentime are pretty much gone
