I was thinking back to crush and in bloom like yup sweat is worse (line wise I loved the song in general it was toooo good) idk how I'll cope I should just end my life now I can't do it. Then I woke up again lowkey felt like shit still but then I saw a bunch of posts about the line distribution and on average the lines were actually even the person with the lowest had almost 20 seconds and Matthew was around 30 so even if I'm mad I can't say my bias was paid dust cuz they rlly weren'tðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ for me I just got sad because I've never seen the members be this excited for the song and even tho I'm still disappointed the song is very good and everyone seems to like the performance + the emka repos we're very good. A lot of this is mv screentime issues and rosin allin anger on all sides and u have to remember this is a pre release like I just cant be assed for all this depression and anger when it's not that serious"
