      <p>ig like for sweat teaser as of rn 1pril 20 1:45 AM EST so we can stfu cuz why we comparing AGAIN

hanbin 246k
jiwoong 243k
Hao 349K
Matt 473K
Taerae 188k
Ricky 393K
Gyuvin 188K
Gunwook 297K
Yujin 260K

ig is mostly ran by international fans so the likes makes sense for matt and ricky being on top. and depending on platform different members engagement would be different base on how active they are on those platforms. k can we stfu and stop comparing and busting out the spreadsheets thats fcking up the fandom? thanks.</p>

      <p>Yeah because his fans were making spreadsheets and getting upset that 5/6 members were having higher engagements on their post and started saying they had to work harder to improve engagements which is stupid af anyway because no one aside fans are using mnet plus anyway</p>
