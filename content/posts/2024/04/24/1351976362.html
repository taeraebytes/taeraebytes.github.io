      <p>I'm honestly just feeling bad for the boys I feel like the crush era traumatised and I really tht this era would go well, u could see how they kept hyping this song literally every member on bbl they were particularly begging us to listen and like this song but God line distribution only becomes an issue in intl side but this time even kside is worse just hope the best for tt ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Yea they all really like sweat and I see why it's a really good song and I think it's their best release so far just sucks everyone's mad about it. Like I got over it so fast I hope the anger dissipates like it's a pre release we'll live
