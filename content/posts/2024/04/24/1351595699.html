      <p>Do you think we can go no1 in iTunes this comeback and hit high on BB? Or chart no.1 in any circle chart? Are those Rosins helping or they will also boycott the digitals?</p>

      <p>Anon rosins are kinda easy to please jsjsj (I'm talking about normal ones not schizos) so if the distribution is like yura yura, they're gonna buy...I saw lot of them switch up and buy the Japanese albums as well and the akgaes were like 'ok it's your money but we shouldn't be satisfied with the bare minimum'  like girl exactly that's their money so stfu</p>
