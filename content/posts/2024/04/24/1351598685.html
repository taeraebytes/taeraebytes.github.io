      <p>Why do I think that someone is laundering money in Hao's fanbases? What's with those expensive projects just for the anniversary? They have 7-11 store, a coffee shop, multiple billboards in different countries, ads on all Olive Young stores all over korea and many more.where do these people getting all their money?</p>
