    "question": "It sucks that they’re a survival show group bc if the fans were normal no one would be upset apart from gunwook fans imo. The MV was cute, the song is really good and the members are happy so why can’t we ever just be excited too. Hopefully everyone can just be satisfied for once and stopping deciding whether u like the song or not based on where ur member places on the line distribution board. I pity gunwook fans tho, i don’t think he’s ever gotten a decent amount of lines for himself.",
    "reply": "they're too dumb to notice gunwook doesn't get much and fights for other people 90% of them will be alright"
