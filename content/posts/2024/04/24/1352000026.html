Never said u couldn't be upset but it comes to a point that when I say I wish a lot of the anger would go away because it's obvious how hard everyone worked and I get annoyed seeing the same regurgitated points rosin #1-10 already voiced this to me.. and u come in here with a fuck u blah blah blah yea im gonna get annoyed and tell u to stop raining on the parade because we're over it ðŸ˜­"

      <p>I thought he was at 6 no? But I feel like the numbers are definitely getting to peoples heads because there's 1 second differences between half of the group it's rlly as even as u can get. Like positions and talent considerations aside it's rlly a fact that it's even it's just about standing out in performance to me that's important now. And let's all be happy it's a prerelease pleaseeeeeeee I haven't actually been this down in the dumps ab the group in forever

      <p>every line distribution I've seen has had him around 6-7 and I need u guys to understand ppl being happy â‰  fuck hao....??? And like I said atp it's more ab standing out in performance and line completion at this point.. there's no point of u have 25 seconds of lines if 10 seconds are adlibs and the other 15 are shared 2 linersðŸ˜­ clearly no one has a grasp of the actual distribution but it's evident that it's looks like the whole song was chopped 9 ways. like sure be mad but don't rain on anyways parade over a pre release get real
