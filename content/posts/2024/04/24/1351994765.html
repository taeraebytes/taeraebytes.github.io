      <p>big fandom = more hype generated and not to mention he's been consistently well in engagements and appeals to the intl English speaking audience zb1 always lacked and my second point here is almost no push has benefited the group sonically so why does it have to now? esp in a pre release bside üò≠... and the push is him just getting more completed lines in a pretty equal distribution and mv screentime. He's definitely a well promoted member in terms of zb1 but idk like let's lighten up u guys seem real keen on this group being a dictatorship nfjfnfnfnnfnf
