      <p>yeah i donâ€™t notice it as much when they are around eo but during that episode they all looked tiny next to that guy while wearing oversized clothes it was scary ðŸ˜­ now that i think about it the clothes were probably not even meant to be oversize they are just insanely skinny</p>

      <p>Ok Iâ€™m glad someone else pointed it out I noticed it on the live a couple days ago but i remember it being said in here how from in bloom to crush hanbin lost a lot of weight but damn in that live he looked like he lost even more. At least before he still has enough weight on his face to not make it noticeable but the last couple days Iâ€™ve noticed his face has lost so much weight too. Then gyuvins bubble messages about not eating too like none of these boys seems to have the healthiest relationship with food.</p>

      <p>tbh hanbin never gonna look skinny skinny just because of his build, he got the elon musk build with a wide rib. Sorry I'm not even hating but it's the first thing that came to my mind because they both have short torso's so no matter what he's gonna look a bit bigger than the rest just because its his bone structure</p>

      <p>I think yea he has a bigger and shorter torso but that's easy to conceal with the right silhouette he has skinny legs and somewhat long arms so for that styling is his bestfriend I don't pay attention so idk if they got it down for him or not. But he doesn't have a bigger bone structure imo like gunwook has the obvious biggest bone structure but it just makes him look more muscular than he is I think for hanbin it's the fact that he was overweight in the past so he's held at a different expectation and he's holding himself to a harsh one as well. He looks super skinny to me usually but I see what u mean ab his torso when he wears higher waisted pants w a tighter fitted top it's awkward

      <p>Fashion anon ~ Iâ€™m love things like this. Like you said styling is truly his best friend and for 99% of people on this planet styling and having an outfit that suits your proportions can make the most hideous of pieces look good. Hanbin currently I would say is on the thinner side but he has quite a rectangular build and his torso while isnâ€™t that long they definitely dress him in things that make it look a lot longer and donâ€™t sit well on him. I think his build looks better in slightly high waisted but not too high waisted, to not accentuate the torso too much Iâ€™d personally avoid bottoms that sit directly on the waistline. Also they need to start giving him more fitted clothes because he seems to be drowning in half the outfits they have him in and the baggy trousers look isnâ€™t working. His outfits that are more fitted ( for example his outfit he wore in the fact check tiktok) highlight his proportions way better.</p>

      <p>Exactlyyyyy like rlly the foundation of every outfit is silhouette. objectively he's thin literally underweight but yea rectangular and I think so too I feel like the baggier clothes make his figure stand out weird. And I thought that tiktok was good it made u focus on his legs I think his last mc outfit was nice I think that's why he rlly looked so skinny to me there cuz the outfit was nice on him

      <p>I'm not a pro but I always hated how they styled taerae Matthew and hao in particular I feel like the baggy look they usually give them just make mattrae look their heights instead of taller as well as boxier which is bad considering they have big heads, now hao is obviously tall but by dressiyhim like a 12 yo they make him look a lot shorter I feel like he needs thight shirts for sure</p>

      <p>they make mattrae look 3 feet tall I get they're short and there's rlly tall members but even when it's just them alone their heights are obvious more so in Matthew. And yea their heads don't helpðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and yes I'm sorry the boy styling on hao got old like they can stop..... he suits a sensual style way better obviously and hao is the 4th tallest on the group and I feel like the kiddie styling makes everyone forget

      <p>Wonbin is as short as them but you would think he's a lot taller because he's styled way better (and has a smaller head but still</p>
