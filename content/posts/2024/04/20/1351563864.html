      <p>also I've literally never seen outrage for center shit like this in any survival show group or even generally kpop like this is ridiculous it's not even about hao being the center anymore there's smrh wrong with these akgaes 😭😭😭😭 like do they understand their harassment genuinely will turn ppl away from the group and especially hao why would u do this for a FAN BANNER for a CONCERT..

      <p>Girl who cares I'm putting my bias in the middle too it's a concert banner for the whole group it's not illegal if hao isn't on the middle and it's a fan banner like so what?
