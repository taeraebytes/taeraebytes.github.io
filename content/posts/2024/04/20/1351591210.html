      <p>mind u ur assuming this girl is a solo stan because shes a hanbin fan and she posts him on her ig😭😭😭😭 like that isn't everyone and don't forget she works together with hao biased zeroses on a group fanbase for the design to even be printed it had to be approved. Like don't start using what you think as fact to justify harassment nobody said y'all couldn't be irked that's a given for u lot but the reaction was inappropriate through and through

      <p>well req you bought this situation onto yourself with saying things like or allowing anons to say things like "allindans are racist", "allindans are this or that" even tho there is not much of a difference between rosins and allindans. both are subfandoms that cant think clearly when it comes to their faves.</p>

      <p>uhhhh no all I said was rosins used sensitivity to mask bullying to harass an innocent base and they ain't like that. my bad for the misuse of language I should clarify more often it's allin akgaes but usually everyone knows who I'm talking ab when I say that. And I can tell a lot of you are new because I'm being accused of such absurd things like almost every og or regular anon of mine knows there's never been a time I liked either allins or rosins😭 it's funny when I get accused of being one because both are equally slow and psycho about opinions

      <p>new anons dont realize you dont like both. when you agree with them about one "hate" opinion they think they are right all the time. thats why these bitches keep yapping. they think if they talk enough you will agree with them in the end.</p>
