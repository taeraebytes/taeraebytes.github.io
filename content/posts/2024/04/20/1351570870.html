<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mgji84.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/mgji84.jpeg</a> I asked my kbriize oomf what he thought and he said it looked real and that theonly and this ex were fighting so it's prob why things are leaking? and then the acc deleted the convo then posted this

      <p>no I'm serious once u notice the hairline it's obvious he has a Turkish lab grown hair line nowwww not a receding one it's so straight in the least human way possible as all hairline transplants are like for ex: sunwoo haknyeon mingyu taehyung they all have it and wonbins forehead is still kinda big😭 but I think it made it less obvious the black hair needs to come back cuz that's when I was unsure but when he went blond I was like yup its done
