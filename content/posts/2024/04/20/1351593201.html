      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ❤️ 😍. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>
