      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ❤️ 😍. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>

      <p>that allin cc was discussing this and they cant accept that gunwook literally had the biggest growth despite not having schedules like im not even gonna fight with those schizo anymore but its just funny how they really live in their own bubble and they cant see that other members get so much attention</p>
