<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mgji84.jpeg">https://files.catbox.moe/mgji84.jpeg</a> I asked my kbriize oomf what he thought and he said it looked real and that theonly and this ex were fighting so it's prob why things are leaking? and then the acc deleted the convo then posted this

      <p>If I was him and I had been through the mill at sm I’d probably start tweaking a bit too. If everyone else got scandals going on being a little messy isn’t going to hurt</p>

No who cut off who? we might have to go team Anton if it's him hes already soft spoken and anxious it probably took him hella courage to even speak I was watching the deachitwhateverthingy with oomfs cuz my friend was live translating for us and we kept saying "why isn't Anton talking?"
