his face with no make up looks so diff it's crazy not in a bad way ofc but I think it's cuz he has very soft features so the make up strengthens them. Also he looks so skinny his cheeks are gone lmao</p>

      <p>Ngl I hate his stage makeup it makes his face look stronger and he already has a hard time controlling his fierce face while performing like they need to do smth similar to yujin but with less color
