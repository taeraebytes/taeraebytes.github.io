      <p>i felt like this is an overreaction and still do but they also put his last and first name together so fuck them actually üòí i get it when people write like this on twitter but if you are going to make a banner i think you should stick to the correct way of writing it, or if they wanted to only write their names like they did for everyone else they could‚Äôve written ‚Äúhao‚Äù instead of ‚Äúzhanghao‚Äù</p>
