      <p>mind u ur assuming this girl is a solo stan because shes a hanbin fan and she posts him on her ig😭😭😭😭 like that isn't everyone and don't forget she works together with hao biased zeroses on a group fanbase for the design to even be printed it had to be approved. Like don't start using what you think as fact to justify harassment nobody said y'all couldn't be irked that's a given for u lot but the reaction was inappropriate through and through
