      <p>gunwook was sick too why didn't they wait till everyone was all goodü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it's ok that might just be him being over critical of himself they all still seem to like it overall regardless

      <p>They were probably on a time crunch to roll out the next cb since the last one was November and they had jp debut in between all of that. Tbh with how busy these boy‚Äôs schedules are it seems like all of them are getting sick every other day.</p>

      <p>i remember hao did a voice live at the time and he sounded super sick even when singing, idk why they couldn‚Äôt at least rerecord his lines since it was months before the comeback, like this is going to stay on their discography forever</p>

      <p>They rlly didn't have to do it this early like yea the songs are prepared but we already have shit mixing to deal with please don't add over post produced vocals tooüòí gunwook sounded a little disappointed too so i think we might actually hear it thru the musicüò≠
