      <p>Yeah sm vocalists have an automatic vocal halo even though they barely sing live which I get because taeyeon jonghyun baekhyun etc but most of their groups have a ton of untalented filler members, however sms strength is that usually the untalented members don't embarrass them live (although again, they barely do sing live)</p>

      <p>Trueaxxxxx they know how to utilize the non singers like you don't rlly have to be amazing to sing just good on the ears and it'll only get better since live singing is a bigger rarity than it used to be. I doubt the lsfm show will do anything but just make people hyper focus on encores (kfans are now mass voting for baemon so they can win and do an encore) no one cares ab live vocals anymore though zb1 do get their praise here and there but nothing major

      <p>its just sinophobia üò≠ china was one of the worlds most advanced nations back then like they invented paper, gun powder and has one of the most advance writing system etc like america wouldn't be MURICAAA with guns blazin if it weren't for the chinese but then the europeans came, took all their shit, stole their tea, stole their plates and got them hooked on opium. They even said chinese were dirty rats because they bathed everyday or something while europeans only bathed once a month and smothered themselves in perfume and threw their shit out the window üò≠ 

then basically propaganda, first with msg, which isn't even bad but white ppl made it seem like it was some toxic down syndrome spice when it's literally just miso soup, like the umami flavor is natural then the whole china making cheap things because WE purposely outsource our products to them because we know it's cheap with child labour and inhumane conditions. China makes expensive high quality things and can also make cheap fragile things but we want profit so ofc we gonna pay for the cheapest thing and sell it for 10x more here. I could go on but yeah it's just simply sinophobia and propaganda over the centuries. I'm not even chinese I'm just into history but this is like the top of the iceberg on why the west 'hates' china. Korea, japan got their own beef.</p>
