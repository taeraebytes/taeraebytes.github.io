      <p>Yeah sm vocalists have an automatic vocal halo even though they barely sing live which I get because taeyeon jonghyun baekhyun etc but most of their groups have a ton of untalented filler members, however sms strength is that usually the untalented members don't embarrass them live (although again, they barely do sing live)</p>

      <p>Trueaxxxxx they know how to utilize the non singers like you don't rlly have to be amazing to sing just good on the ears and it'll only get better since live singing is a bigger rarity than it used to be. I doubt the lsfm show will do anything but just make people hyper focus on encores (kfans are now mass voting for baemon so they can win and do an encore) no one cares ab live vocals anymore though zb1 do get their praise here and there but nothing major

      <p>Koreans kills me they somehow hate Chinese idols more than japanese idols like I rlly wonder what it is that even the historical context Chinas demonized more over there ü§î I gotta ask around and find out it's not even just korea like the whole world hates China omgüò≠ but right zb1 have to work 10x harder for bare praise
