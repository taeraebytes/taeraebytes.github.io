      <p>Yeah no thank you I don't want gunwook to be bullied by allin akgaes like they did to the members over that bum ass bada show appearance that made no fucking noise. They're already talking about this and saying wakeone better not turn it into a group project and bring the other dozens with hanbin bye they can have the bada payola wrdc</p>

      <p>How can it be the same 15 people when their tweets get hundreds of likes and they have thousands of followers ugh I hate these people so bad they ruin my mood for the entire day if I see a tweet from them. Wish I was as unbothered as you are</p>

      <p>wow this makes me rmbr what I've been thru like no gpd got crucified by allins as hard as me and those people will get hit tweets off me every 2 weeks and threaten me but idk maybe I've just seen so much shit idc anymore. Like the akgae narratives are much weaker than they used to be and gpds have woken up in some way that all they can do is shade instead of drag gunwook directly like they used to. And when you rmbr that these things don't affect anything for gunwook like he just keeps growing in popularity and exposure leads to opportunity there hate tweets don't hit. I still hate them deeply that's not gonna change but things like this idc ab anymore yes put him in there we're going to clout munch and eat the fuck goooood. Honestly now the shade tweets kind of make me smile like he really bothers them this much it's nothing but insecurity I would be mad too if gunwook wasn't my bias and I watched him excel at everythingüòá And seriously the gunwook drags don't even hit anymore there's nothing they can ever say about him so they resort to the same exact defunct takes and dickrifing korean troll opinions with no value. Like we're always gonna beef and hate allins but ever since 2024 started getting better for gunwook I'm lit as fuckkk. Sorry for the word salad
