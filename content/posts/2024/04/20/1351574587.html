      <p>mind you in the pann comments about hao's mnet plus controversy those freaks were saying why did this man even get the center position he's chinese and most of them werent even talking about the issue at hand and were straight up calling him slurs but sure people are just overreacting and have no reason to be paranoid please dont fucking talk like you understand what it feels like to stan him</p>

      <p>so because of an already known racist Reddit adjacent forums comments it was okay for u guys to harass innocent concert goers over a fan made banner because he wasn't in the middle..... those two things are unrelated like do u hear urselves ...?

      <p>are you playing dumb? the reason his fans are extra sensitive over his position is BECAUSE of the insane amount of shit he gets for it cuz of his ethnicity?? just take one fucking look at kforums? " Reddit adjacent forums " then why yall start crying when your favs get whacked on those forums if they dont matter? and as a fandom and someone who claims to be ot9 (op) they should've put more thought into it because they know how crazy rosins are. yall seem to forget this is the first ever not only foreign but chinese center in kpop like idk why yall act like all this rage comes from this air. Now i'm not saying op should be harassed but i think it's pretty fucking obvious why people would get mad</p>

      <p>so the fan sensitivity justifies harassing random ppl over a banner? I'm not playing dumb I'm just laying it out how it is and ur probably realizing how unrelated and insane it is..... and she should've considered crazy fans in her design? Why? It's clear she and the fanbase didn't expect the backlash sorry not everyone is in tune with schizophrenia not to mention the girl in question is a new zerose so whatever fake ill intent everyone assumed she has is not thereðŸ˜­. I get ur saying ppl can get mad but that's not what happened like at some point ur going to have to recognize that the sensitivity of rosins can't justify things like this every single time. Like my opinion doesn't change she shouldn't have got harassed and it was dumb that she did.. are we just gonna say it's sensitivity every time someone doesn't do rosin bidding at some point it needs to be addressed ur attacking ppl for things out of their control
