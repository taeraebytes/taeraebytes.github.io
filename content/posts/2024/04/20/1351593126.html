      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ❤️ 😍. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>

      <p>I saw a rosin with spreadsheet 🤣 of IG likes of all the solo posts. Gunwook is currently 7th. His average likes is 300K, if I'm remembering it right.
