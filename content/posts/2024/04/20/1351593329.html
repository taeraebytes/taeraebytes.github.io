      <p>It's so terrible like we get it you wanna put pressure on sm but at the end of the day the other 6 are still working hard and if sm makes a choice they make it without intl fans in mind they consider western fans almost never

      <p>have u seen the videos from today belgium fans were following them around (and waiting at their hotel) screaming riize is 7 and holding up signs demanding to bring back seunghan like wtf are the members or managers going to do abt it take it up with the higher ups. i feel so bad for the other members. like for this comeback they had to learn a completely new dance style & would legit practice 8 hrs a day and their own fans cant even appreciate their effort. and this is their best song too like it deserves daebakdom</p>
