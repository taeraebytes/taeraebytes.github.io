      <p>i felt like this is an overreaction and still do but they also put his last and first name together so fuck them actually 😒 i get it when people write like this on twitter but if you are going to make a banner i think you should stick to the correct way of writing it, or if they wanted to only write their names like they did for everyone else they could’ve written “hao” instead of “zhanghao”</p>

      <p>Chinese anon here but I have a 1 syllable name too and usually get called my full name so if people write it without the space it really doesn’t bother me. I feel like most people getting raged aren’t even Chinese because I’ve never known anyone to actually get upset over that if they are usually called by their full name.</p>

      <p>Agreed as another Chinese person, I don't care it isn't disrespectful because my last name IS part of my name and honestly the romanized version of my name is just that, if they wrote the wrong characters THAT would be disrespectful</p>

      <p>I agree I feel like there's been other idols that had one syllable names like luhan and it was pretty normal to just call him that rather than Lu han
