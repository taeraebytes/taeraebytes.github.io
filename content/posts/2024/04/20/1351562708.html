      <p>ok but the way that the members who have done or said shady things bc other members got things that they wanted (Hao, Hanbin and Taerae) are also close within each other it's killing me. I know that at night when gunwook is on the other dorm hanging out with the maknaes, they reunite and ramble about not getting the shit they wanted ðŸ˜­</p>
