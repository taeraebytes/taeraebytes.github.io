      <p>RIGHT LMAAOOOðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it's most likely that because it's not like she's doing anything to get in trouble she's even less removed than bbosongee who just posts hypotheticals, she's translates forums with no opinion

      <p>true but kpop stans think she's the devil's spawn nkdnfksdnfksd i'm not saying she's an innocent angel bc she's a shit ass translator and some of the stuff it's like what even is the point of translating that but they fr act like she comes up with the rumours/scandals herself and that pannchoa IS pann in some weird nonsensical way it wouldn't surprise me if some stan tried to take the blog down, reported it under something, and it somehow worked</p>

      <p>RIGHT like I don't rlly like her cuz she mistranslates at times and just perpetuates rumors and sentiments when the og posts have 200 views 6 comments but that's rlly her only crime well besides targeting sm idolsðŸ˜­ but like I'm ngl I read her shit all the time she's just translating and this is fr her job this is how she pays rent she's just pathetic at worst

      <p>nahhhhhhh i thought she was like south east asian or something... plus the translations are always a bit shoddy like i don't speak korean but the way the sentences are written is ? like surely they can be rephrased to actually make sense, even if this is how they 'interpet' it and so often you'll see someone in the disqus comment section on there correcting her translations</p>
