      <p>Yeah sm vocalists have an automatic vocal halo even though they barely sing live which I get because taeyeon jonghyun baekhyun etc but most of their groups have a ton of untalented filler members, however sms strength is that usually the untalented members don't embarrass them live (although again, they barely do sing live)</p>

      <p>Trueaxxxxx they know how to utilize the non singers like you don't rlly have to be amazing to sing just good on the ears and it'll only get better since live singing is a bigger rarity than it used to be. I doubt the lsfm show will do anything but just make people hyper focus on encores (kfans are now mass voting for baemon so they can win and do an encore) no one cares ab live vocals anymore though zb1 do get their praise here and there but nothing major

      <p>lowkey tho sm gotta have a policy of not debuting you if you can't at least hold the tiniest note and if not they make you a RAPPER and don't give you hard lines example jaemin lucas etc</p>

      <p>No they do they obviously prioritize vocals more than anyone else they're consistent in at least decent main vocals as a minimum requirement though the quality has SEVERELY dropped

      <p>Yeah aespa are good but NCT dream, wish and riize are definitely a drop in quality vocal wise although NCT dream are at least very stable and sing their songs well with nice tones I think it might also be due to the lack of good looking male Korean trainees in recent years</p>

      <p>I didn't even know anyone in nct wish could sing I listened to their one good baseball song they're just all below avg ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but yea the crop of kpop trainees isn't as good it's saturated with bored rich kids. It was more common to find talent in people who had a passion for being performers rather than idols and when being rich wasn't rlly a requirement. also the newer and insaner beauty standards back then you didn't have to be almost perfect or fit it to a T to be regarded as attractive like imo there's more beauty in being unconventionally attractive but now it's harsher and meeting the standard = being attractive so they're only looking for 1-2 types of faces now too

      <p>right idk how to say this without sounding weird but in general in kpop so many of the faces are starting to blur together now üò≠ not in a racist all east asians look the same way (cuz it really wasnt like this before to this extent imo) but I swear companies are only looking for one kind of visual now and idk its just ruining the uniqueness of some of the groups for me like so many of them feel interchangeable now. Like all the new idols are generically pretty but their faces arent memorable (except for a few) if that makes sense</p>

      <p>I agree there's no contrast in visuals or appreciation for unconventional beauties it just makes everything a little bit more lack luster
