      <p>I saw this too and really they are dtm ðŸ˜­ like so many fans are going with their own member specific banners I promise hao is not going to look into the crowd see your ot9 banner and be upset because he wasnâ€™t edited into the centre like i promise he dgaf ðŸ’€ also these people acting like 3 of the admins on that account arenâ€™t hao biased too like why does there always have to be ill intent behind everything for them.</p>

      <p>also I've literally never seen outrage for center shit like this in any survival show group or even generally kpop like this is ridiculous it's not even about hao being the center anymore there's smrh wrong with these akgaes ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like do they understand their harassment genuinely will turn ppl away from the group and especially hao why would u do this for a FAN BANNER for a CONCERT..

      <p>there are multiple admins idk if it was specified which member did it but even then that's speculation based off of an igðŸ˜­.. and again who cares it's a fan banner 99% of ppl are putting their bias in the middle
