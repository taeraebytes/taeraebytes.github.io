      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>

      <p>The only concerning part for me is ricky, his twitter likes are in bottom along with jiwoong, taerae and gyuvin. I mean he barely post but still his engagement is going down üò¢ üò≠</p>

      <p>Rosins are saying that Ricky is the one buying likes since the beginning and they're out of funds now. Ijbol! I don't know which one is better, his fans buying likes or him losing popularity.</p>

      <p>i think he‚Äôs losing his core fanbase gradually due to his inactivity before that‚Äôs why the twt engagement was kinda bad since not many casuals use twt but his engagement on ig/tiktok is always good tho his bite me reels is more than 900k now and his tiktok is like ~200k still without the sound but im not a riyangi so this is all just observation ig
and it‚Äôs kinda sad to me that compared to the fairytale concept this time we have less likes on twt like last time for matt‚Äôs it was 100k likes or so and this time 76k. and he‚Äôs the most liked on both concept so our fanbase does shrink over crush huh‚Ä¶ i hope this prerelease brings in a new wave of fans</p>

      <p>Don't worry they were simpler teasers and just for the prerelease I think there will be a new wave of fans and more hype for the actual cb but I agree with the whole thing ab his inactivity
