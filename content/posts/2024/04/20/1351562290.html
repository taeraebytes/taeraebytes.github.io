Like I don't understand the whole sensitivity thing anymore we've moved past our roughest time and the group is in an even more vulnerable position HELLOOOOO WHATRE U DOING and I'd block them too tf ur not dragging me for smrh I did for others and for free. matter of fact if I ever design a banner for a concert im putting gunwook in the middle mi nuh careeeeðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
