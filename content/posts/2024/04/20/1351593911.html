Ricky 393K
Gyuvin 188K

Yujin 260K

ig is mostly ran by international fans so the likes makes sense for matt and ricky being on top. and depending on platform different members engagement would be different base on how active they are on those platforms. k can we stfu and stop comparing and busting out the spreadsheets thats fcking up the fandom? thanks.</p>
