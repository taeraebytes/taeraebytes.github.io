      <p>Only Asia thinks he's not that handsome, but we all know that Western people have different tastes and standards. They prefered manly visuals like Gunwook. But would have been better if he was allowed to rap</p>

      <p>only asia..?????😭 gunwook is one of the most popular if not the most in japan + his visuals are revered and besides his hate train in korea he still gets praise he doesn't fit the standard of beauty currently sure but that's not a marker of attractiveness it's aight it doesn't rlly bother me. but yea I wish he was allowed to rap but that would mean he would have to sing less and he's part of the vocal line so it's lowkey a losing game because he's not given major parts of songs 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
