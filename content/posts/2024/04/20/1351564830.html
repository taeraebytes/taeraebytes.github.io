      <p>Nothing has been said yet but like you said since they know eachother it would have made sense for him to be one of the guest anyway. Also I was wondering why his company was producing it and then I found out studio glide was originally opened by Ravi as a media and production label and they have actually worked on quite a bit, so when they said hanbin was their first trainee they meant it fr. They own the yt channel studio peanut butter the one that does those videos like school attack and such so please get zb1 on school attack or something because I remember watching those videos a lot when I was a new kpop fan🙏🏾.</p>
