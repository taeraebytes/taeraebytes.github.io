      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ❤️ 😍. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>

      <p>Yeah. I checked the recent engagement (since January) and Gunwook surpassed both Hanbin and Jiwoong. Ricky,Hao and Yujin are consistent top 3, but it's Matthew or Gunwook after them. That's a big leap.</p>
