hanbin 246k
jiwoong 243k
Hao 349K
Matt 473K
Taerae 188k
Ricky 393K
Gyuvin 188K
Gunwook 297K
Yujin 260K

ig is mostly ran by international fans so the likes makes sense for matt and ricky being on top. and depending on platform different members engagement would be different base on how active they are on those platforms. k can we stfu and stop comparing and busting out the spreadsheets thats fcking up the fandom? thanks.</p>

      <p>I actually check that spreadsheet since i'm bored. Almost all the ZB1 members had IG lijes with just few gaps with each other . Like, most of them had 400K-ish. But what changed in September that the gap started becoming crazy? Like, the gap of most and least likes became 500K.</p>
