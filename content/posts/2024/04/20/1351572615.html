      <p>also I've literally never seen outrage for center shit like this in any survival show group or even generally kpop like this is ridiculous it's not even about hao being the center anymore there's smrh wrong with these akgaes üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ like do they understand their harassment genuinely will turn ppl away from the group and especially hao why would u do this for a FAN BANNER for a CONCERT..

      <p>Honestly I don't get why hao in particular has such awful akgaes because it's so clear he doesn't fuck with them and he always promote the group first and foremost like why are they embarrassing themselves for a man that they know wouldn't want it?? He's not even parasocial at all and always hypes up his members like why?? Is this just about fandom pride atp cause no way you look at hao and think he cares in the slightest</p>

      <p>I always notice this isolating sentiment they have I think seriously in their minds they've removed hao from the group which makes no sense to meüò≠üò≠üò≠ he rlly likes his fandom + zeroses + the group + being an idol so when these people get majorly insufferable or just act out it rlly makes u wonder like who are they doing this for??????

      <p>if knetz didn't respect his center position they wouldn't call zb1 a Chinese group there is no doubt that everyone knows and can tell who zb1s center is ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and this isn't paranoia this is bullying

      <p>I see comments in the kfansom all the time introducing hao as the center and saying the only confirmed position in zb1 is that hao is the center and hanbin the leader, yes centerz is the official haobin chemi name but that's not center erasure bruh it's just a cute callback to bp and everyone thinks they fuck so they call them neulbin way more anyway, people outside the fandom acknowledge that he's the center too, negatively cause they use it as an excuse to be racist but still, he's received very well for a Chinese idol</p>

      <p>like Sinophobia was a given but hao is soooooo popular in korea despite everything like it's only a victimizing twitter agenda that'll make u think that his position isn't recognized or respected that's just not reality I'm sorry

      <p>diff anon but ngl the use of the "centerz" chemi name has always rubbed me the wrong way, it's not just used by rps spaces but also sometimes in k-media, personally if i were a non-fan and knew nothing about the group and that's what i saw I'd automatically and without a doubt assume there's both centers? Just recently there was an article in k-media about the best two popular members combinations in kpop groups and they mentioned hao and hanbin as the centerz,  they didn't even call hao the final center of the group and kept blabbering about how both of them were centers in boys planet signal song and final performances like that's gonna be relevant to non fans? 
Of course not everyone uses it with ill intentions because I see a lot of k-zeroses and k-shippers use it but it can and definitely does cause ambiguity and can be disregarding to hao's position at the only center of the group.</p>

      <p>Do they have a different popular chemi name? Ik there's mirrorz but nobody uses that. not every reporters gonna be great tbh like for the most part hao is acknowledged by media as center they may slip a few times but what can u do wakeone have no media play and it's not like it's common or has diminished hao in any way. Also bp was lowkey their peak and survival show groups are always tied w the show no matter what so its eh like singular factors are annoying but at this point literally nothing could diminish his position it's solidified
