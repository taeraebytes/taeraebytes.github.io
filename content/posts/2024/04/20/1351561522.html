      <p>like redebuting in a group without any members would probably only work for yujin and Matthew has one of the smaller kfandoms ik intl fame is a thing but will they carry a group of ppl they don't care ab I doubt it.. and he gave up his Canadian citizenship so ig he's intending on promoting in korea

      <p>idk the thing about his canadian citizenship we’ll have to wait till his birthday this year to know since he’s not legally 22 yet since korea changed their law… if he appeared with a korean passport after that we’ll know for sure but not now i think</p>

      <p>I thought it was 21 🤔 and he was seen with a Korean passport already cuz the Canadian one is black but maybe he has double of the choice wasn't already made but I coulda swore we were talking ab him already choosing korea. But if he didn't bruh someone tell him CHOOSE CANADA CHOOSE CANADA not only will he go to the military but now international Artist visa fees for america are increased by 300%😭😭😭

      <p>nah i asked another fan of him and they said it is when he’s 22 that he has to choose so he has dual citizenship for now. i doubt that he’d choose korea because his whole family is still canadians and i think many korean canadians/americans still work well in korea so i dont see a reason why he has to choose korea. i hope he wont, cant lose him to the barricade omfg</p>

      <p>ahhhh ok so it's on his bday essentially ok he has a month. I hope he doesn't choose korea either but it rlly makes u think ab all the factors of the choice he's already been in korea since he was like 18-19 and probably wants to be a kpop idol for a long time so it's not like he would need his Canadian citizenship he would only go back to go home and be with family not to lead a life🤔 his backup plan was to go back if he didn't make it tho and obviously anyone would resonate with where they were born and raised esp w their family still being there but he might take less cuts home with the paychecks and stuff moving forward. Ok my bad now I'm just rambling like I'm Matthew himself but I know I wouldn't choose korea if I were him. In my head he's like a Korean wasian he better choose Canada 😭

      <p>Even if he wants to work in Korea it's better to keep his Canadian citizenship cause he'll just lose 2 years of his career if he's Korea</p>

      <p>and THANK U GODDDDDDDDD we don't need mark around matthew ugh kevin makes my heart melt THE PUREST SOUL😭🩷 I always loved him but he's the perfect person for Matthew to be close to I hope they get closer kevin would rlly take him under his wing forever and I need that Kevin was always my 2-3rd bias and so is matthew. But if he asked Kevin he definitely gave him good advice and probably told him to choose Canada

      <p>He’s loved by everyone because he’s talented and extremely hardworking. It’s just insane how he was actively promoting in nct, nct 127, nct dream, superm and solo back to back without breaks he’s probably one of the most overworked idols ever and has never complained about it it’s actually admirable</p>

      <p>No wait your right he signed the most fucked up 360 deal in the world he's been slowly getting his life span shaven away by sm and it's barely paid off sm doesn't promo him nearly as much as the other members especially considering how much they put him thru and the music he's released doesn't count imo cuz only his fans listened to that🤦‍♀️ like taeyongs music was listened by more people cuz he's revered as a musician probably cuz he was smart about his individuality + nct center leader and gets pushed. Like that's kind of sad mark lowkey bums out all he gets is just being highlighted as an nct member he has no brand connection no mcing deals no identity outside of nct or even a chance to hold himself as a soloist

      <p>Yeah and honestly it's a shame cause imo he's a better rapper than taeyong, an ok singer and a great dancer and performer plus he got this very likeable personality he's ncts biggest gem imo sucks that they don't promote him as much</p>

      <p>see I can admit that I just never vibed enough to be fond and can we please clock I think he's more talented than taeyong even tho he's technically more well rounded they're both same level of for singing but I prefer marks dancing taeyong looks dumb but this is so fucked up sm rlly drained marks life force he genuinely is never leaving either. Cuz when u think about it in a way marks stunted mentally (all of dream are but he's the worst since he's more naive and I think he might actually be the dumbest + omg also no family and a foreigner omg I feel so bad wait😭) so it's not like he's thinking on the same level of his peers so with the 360 deal on top of that sm will milk him beyondddd dry with no profit in return

      <p>He catches heat but it doesn't change anything he still gets more and more even tho his fandom is literally almost gone and mark who unfortunately is losing popularity too (more of an inevitable thing than taeyong being shitty and losing fans) and will never get anything
