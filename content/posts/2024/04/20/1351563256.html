    "question": "Ok I think that it's bc korea is a nationalist country, and as someone who lives in a continent with another country who is also super nationalist I know that they hate when they feel like someone used their country as an step up toll for other things. Those type of countries dislike when foreigners go and study on their countries and then when they graduate they go back to their country to work, same reason why koreans dislike when chinese idols debut in a kpop group, become popular in china and then they leave. While japanese idols usually never leave the kpop industry, bc the japanese music industry is hard to break into specially when a lot of japanese idols are not main vocalist's so it's more difficult to launch a solo career in Japan.",
