      <p>yeah i don‚Äôt notice it as much when they are around eo but during that episode they all looked tiny next to that guy while wearing oversized clothes it was scary üò≠ now that i think about it the clothes were probably not even meant to be oversize they are just insanely skinny</p>

      <p>Ok I‚Äôm glad someone else pointed it out I noticed it on the live a couple days ago but i remember it being said in here how from in bloom to crush hanbin lost a lot of weight but damn in that live he looked like he lost even more. At least before he still has enough weight on his face to not make it noticeable but the last couple days I‚Äôve noticed his face has lost so much weight too. Then gyuvins bubble messages about not eating too like none of these boys seems to have the healthiest relationship with food.</p>

      <p>I actually feel so bad for them, without giving to much away I do a sport professionally and because of how much energy I burn through that I have to eat nearly twice as much as the regular person to make it back up and stay healthy. You can tell from how quick they are loosing fat but not building much muscle (some of them) that they are burning alot of energy but not eating enough in the first place to replace it.</p>

      <p>Oh yup me too when I played varsity volleyball I ate triple what I ate now the calorie loss was so high I became anemic still üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ BUT OKAY PROFESSIONALLYYYYY OKAYYYYüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè but yea you can tell the weight loss is super damaging and unsustainable I learned so much ab nutrition and even when u wanna be stick thin there's still a smarter way to do it this is genuinely so bad

      <p>Same anon. I mean it‚Äôs wakeone so they probably don‚Äôt but I hope these boys can at least see a proper dietician or nutritionist because promotions are about to start then they have Kcon and an upcoming tour and if this pattern continues we‚Äôre going to be getting a lot of ‚Äòhello this is wakeone‚Äô notices. Speaking from early days experience it‚Äôs so easy to deteriorate on a bad diet and high energy schedule.</p>

      <p>I'm just worried this could affect them long term I mean it always will but I mean smth swrious long term please I don't wanna see anyone have to get surgery or develop gastritis. Like not only does it affect their health but it's gonna affect eeeeeeeeeverythinf ab their job they won't be able to function I hope whatever personal or company pressures there are dissipate or AT LEAST seek out a nutritionist that'll help them sustain
