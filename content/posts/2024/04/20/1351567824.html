      <p>I saw this too and really they are dtm 😭 like so many fans are going with their own member specific banners I promise hao is not going to look into the crowd see your ot9 banner and be upset because he wasn’t edited into the centre like i promise he dgaf 💀 also these people acting like 3 of the admins on that account aren’t hao biased too like why does there always have to be ill intent behind everything for them.</p>

      <p>also I've literally never seen outrage for center shit like this in any survival show group or even generally kpop like this is ridiculous it's not even about hao being the center anymore there's smrh wrong with these akgaes 😭😭😭😭 like do they understand their harassment genuinely will turn ppl away from the group and especially hao why would u do this for a FAN BANNER for a CONCERT..

      <p>Honestly I don't get why hao in particular has such awful akgaes because it's so clear he doesn't fuck with them and he always promote the group first and foremost like why are they embarrassing themselves for a man that they know wouldn't want it?? He's not even parasocial at all and always hypes up his members like why?? Is this just about fandom pride atp cause no way you look at hao and think he cares in the slightest</p>

      <p>I always notice this isolating sentiment they have I think seriously in their minds they've removed hao from the group which makes no sense to me😭😭😭 he rlly likes his fandom + zeroses + the group + being an idol so when these people get majorly insufferable or just act out it rlly makes u wonder like who are they doing this for??????

      <p>I think it's interesting cause hao seems to want freedom the most but a big drawback for him is his fandom, there's a lot of idols known for being blunt and sassy but hao has to censor himself constantly cause his fans are crazy and you can tell he hates it lol he's just SO himself he doesn't like having to change for an audience

For ex I remember one time he casually said that he fought with Hanbin before the live but they made up and then had clarify for 5min that friends fight all the time its normal it's no big deal etc probably because he was afraid his fans would jump Hanbin for no reason and honestly despite what allins akgaes say he loves Hanbin down and wants to protect him I think that's very clear by now even to his nastiest akgaes and they just. Don't care another one is how after the live he went on bbl and said he was just talking and apologised and his fans thought he was forced like I feel bad atp 😭</p>
