      <p>Yeah no thank you I don't want gunwook to be bullied by allin akgaes like they did to the members over that bum ass bada show appearance that made no fucking noise. They're already talking about this and saying wakeone better not turn it into a group project and bring the other dozens with hanbin bye they can have the bada payola wrdc</p>
