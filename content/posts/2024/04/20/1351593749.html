      <p>well midas touch got crazy engagements before the song dropped, everyone was hyped while riize didn't have that so it's not only the boycott at all</p>

      <p>well the reason nobody was hyped was bc their fans were basically trying to hide it. they wouldnâ€™t hype anything riize related & they only talked abt the boycott the only time they would post riize content was old videos from ot7 or anything seunghan related. so unless u had notifications on from riize directly, there was no way u would even know abt the comeback. fans are a lot more important to a groups success than u think theyâ€™re the best form of promo</p>
