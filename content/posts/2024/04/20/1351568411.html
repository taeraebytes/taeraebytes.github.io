      <p>I saw this too and really they are dtm 😭 like so many fans are going with their own member specific banners I promise hao is not going to look into the crowd see your ot9 banner and be upset because he wasn’t edited into the centre like i promise he dgaf 💀 also these people acting like 3 of the admins on that account aren’t hao biased too like why does there always have to be ill intent behind everything for them.</p>

      <p>also I've literally never seen outrage for center shit like this in any survival show group or even generally kpop like this is ridiculous it's not even about hao being the center anymore there's smrh wrong with these akgaes 😭😭😭😭 like do they understand their harassment genuinely will turn ppl away from the group and especially hao why would u do this for a FAN BANNER for a CONCERT..

      <p>Honestly I don't get why hao in particular has such awful akgaes because it's so clear he doesn't fuck with them and he always promote the group first and foremost like why are they embarrassing themselves for a man that they know wouldn't want it?? He's not even parasocial at all and always hypes up his members like why?? Is this just about fandom pride atp cause no way you look at hao and think he cares in the slightest</p>

      <p>I always notice this isolating sentiment they have I think seriously in their minds they've removed hao from the group which makes no sense to me😭😭😭 he rlly likes his fandom + zeroses + the group + being an idol so when these people get majorly insufferable or just act out it rlly makes u wonder like who are they doing this for??????

      <p>if knetz didn't respect his center position they wouldn't call zb1 a Chinese group there is no doubt that everyone knows and can tell who zb1s center is 🤦‍♀️ and this isn't paranoia this is bullying
