      <p>yeah i don’t notice it as much when they are around eo but during that episode they all looked tiny next to that guy while wearing oversized clothes it was scary 😭 now that i think about it the clothes were probably not even meant to be oversize they are just insanely skinny</p>

      <p>Ok I’m glad someone else pointed it out I noticed it on the live a couple days ago but i remember it being said in here how from in bloom to crush hanbin lost a lot of weight but damn in that live he looked like he lost even more. At least before he still has enough weight on his face to not make it noticeable but the last couple days I’ve noticed his face has lost so much weight too. Then gyuvins bubble messages about not eating too like none of these boys seems to have the healthiest relationship with food.</p>

      <p>I actually feel so bad for them, without giving to much away I do a sport professionally and because of how much energy I burn through that I have to eat nearly twice as much as the regular person to make it back up and stay healthy. You can tell from how quick they are loosing fat but not building much muscle (some of them) that they are burning alot of energy but not eating enough in the first place to replace it.</p>
