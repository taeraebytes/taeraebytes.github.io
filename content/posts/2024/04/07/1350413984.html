      <p>ok whatâ€™s getting me here is that why are they mad about the assigning the African ethnicity thing ðŸ˜­ i can almost guarantee anon is not black like damn can we not just have a little fun as black peopleâ€¦ and why did they specifically point out that part like people did it for so many other ethnicities and other unserious things but itâ€™s a problem when itâ€™s africans damn these people donâ€™t know how to laugh</p>
