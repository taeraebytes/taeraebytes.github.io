      <p>Do you think thereâ€™s anyone natural in zb1 without any filler or surgery (including veneers)? 

I guess from most to least with details imo is:
1. Hanbin (eyes, nose, chin, cheekbone reduction, accompanying facelift to reduce extra skin from shaved cheekbones (look at his ears), and like a little lip filler for his upper lip)
2. Zhanghao (chin, eyes, nose, veneers but like a good set)
3. Jiwoong (veneers but like a BAD set, filler, hair transplant)
4. Matthew (nose, chin, filler)
5. Ricky (chin, filler)
6. Taerae (eyes, nose)
7. Gyuvin (eyes)
8. Gunwook (eyes, potentially jaw)
9. Yujin (eyes)</p>

      <p>no gunwooks eyes and jaw have been the same he's only gotten filler in his nose tip and a potential alarplasty but I would put taerae above Ricky cuz his work is less invasive and gyuvins gotten a nose implant I'm p sure so he's higher too ermmm yujin idk I feel like his eyes and nose dermal filler. And interestingly enough I was talking ab haos teeth yesterday with friends they're natural imo he's a bottom ranker for teeth just cuz he has a natural square shape for all of them and his teeth are small. his eyes are I believe the same for him it's chin implant chin filler and nose dermal filler. Jiwoong never pegged me as a Turkish hairline bro but he might've gotten plugs elsewhere
