And by stan I mean purchase their horrible albums and survive through their sucky music and voices just to hear him for maybe 5 seconds a song? Just so he can get some food in the table? This is like a worst case scenario thought experiment, I donâ€™t think thisâ€™ll actually happened but would you actually still support his group?",
