      <p>half the fandom wants to boycott the cb and by boycott they literally want to sabotage it aka unfollowing all official accs, not streaming music or watching yt content, not sharing ANY riize content (cb videos, posts, mc sohee, variety, fan edits, literally anything that involves a member even if it’s not through sm even though they claim to be boycotting sm). all the 80k+ follower fanbases came together to start it and have since been ia. except now the fandom is basically fighting eo over boycotting bc it’s gotten so out of hand. seunghan akgaes are using the boycott to send hate to riize, ot6ers are using it as an excuse to hate seunghan more. a lot of ot7 boycotting fans are getting away with blatantly hating on the other members and getting 10k+ hit tweets saying the music is shit now and their choreo is sloppy. ppl are harassing editors AND EVEN NON FANS AND RIIZES FRIENDS WHO ARE DANCING TO THEIR SONG to boycott and to stop listening to their music. they’re trying to report riize’s sounds and videos on tiktok to get them removed. don’t even look at riize’s comment section on tiktok, ig, bc nobody cares abt the other members everyone is just spamming abt seunghan. even on their cb trailer video they’re completely disrespecting the members. and then they claim it’s for the protection of the group which is insane like their fans are actively trying to ruin their career over a guy who was in the group for 2 months. so many are literally WISHING for their cb to flop bc they think somehow sm will bring seunghan back bc they genuinely don’t care abt the ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS into the cb. the whole situation is messed up. antis are taking advantage of the boycott to hate on the group and briize are literally hyping them up for it. and if u don’t agree with the boycott u get ostracized and called ot6 and they act like ur a fucking nazi when they’re the ones who are projecting on the members and completely disregarding their wishes bc THEY LITERALLY ASKED FANS TO SUPPORT THEM especially after all the nasty rumors 

so if u and all the anons in here could spare a stream on april 18 pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏based off the leak its giving gay european club music. and the b sides come out on the 29th and one of them is 1d/5sos pop rock</p>
