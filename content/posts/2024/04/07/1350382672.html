      <p>hi I heard something about Ricky not having a dad on twitter and was wondering if you knew anything else about that? I know about his Irvine friends not rocking with him much and that he got really bad grades in school but what's the stuff about his dad? And the stuff about his siblings not talking to him either?</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ pretty much that hs dad is absent its just rumor and speculation but it seems likely ppl think that his dad never actually lived with them in america and stayed in china and the sibling thing is back when we thought he had 3 siblings he doesnt its just jessica and theyre close

      <p>I'm not sure why you all take everything on Twitter so seriously when during BP, people were spreading rumors that Yujin's father is a garbage collector, Yujin comes from a poor family, and he begged clothes from Gyuvin, and people were telling a whole ass narrative about how a poor child like Yujin is going to lift his family out of poverty. Yujin's mother is beautiful, do you think she will marry a garbage collector? ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>1 - ricky (mama clothing line)
2 - gyuvin (guy lives in apgujeong, thatâ€™s like yu jaeseokâ€™s neighbourhood)
3 - yujin (idk about him in detail but u can tell heâ€™s rich)

â€”

4,5 (not in order) - hanbin and Matthew 
You canâ€™t support a rock climbing career for the daughter and years of kpop trainee for the son with a cafe like cmon. for Matthew? just vibes 

6, 7, 8, 9 (not in order) - taerae gunwook hao jiwoong 
jw is non explanatory. 
hao, I know ppl think heâ€™s well off cos he has a violin but that guy has gone on so many part time jobs and judging from him saying he couldnâ€™t go to the amusement park cos the ticket was so pricy, heâ€™s at MOST middle class. 
gunwook and taerae deffo middle class</p>

      <p>Matthew is definitely working class he lived a very avg life in surrey and ngl taerae and gunwook are probably higher than hanbin they're pretty obviously well off
