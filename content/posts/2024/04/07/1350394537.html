      <p>Why is Matthew considered ugly in regards to the Korean Beauty standards? This isnâ€™t me being defensive or anything Iâ€™m genuinely just trying to figure it out. Like Iâ€™m not delulu over his looks or any of theirs (especially since half the group has had work done or has migrating filler and I donâ€™t judge natural looks on the same level of artificial ones) but what about Matt makes him worse than Taerae? Both are super short and I donâ€™t think either of them have had work done so Iâ€™m just confused, thereâ€™s no blaring difference between them so Iâ€™m ???</p>

      <p>ehmmmm there's no way u don't think taerae or Matthew have gotten work done they're higher on the list than some membersðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I know taerae has done his eyes a good amt of filler and I think nose? But Matthew most definitely got a rhinoplasty his nose job kinda sucks and i think smth with his chin maybe a shave. But idk what to tell u Matthew has pretty much monolids and like a bigger nose and taerae doesn't so he's put higher ig for the standard also just by looking at them you can tell who's the native who's the diaspora
