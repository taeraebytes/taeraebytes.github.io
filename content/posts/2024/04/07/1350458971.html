      <p>sohee clearly doesn’t need payola from hanbin bc why did he trend and went viral on kr twitter and theqoo for his cover while hanbin didn’t? he got 100k in just 7 hours too or maybe it’s bc he is just a better vocalist 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s crazy because hanbin is clearly being favored by mcountdown but still can’t surpass sohee who’s not even the most popular riize member</p>
