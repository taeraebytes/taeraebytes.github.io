      <p>Do you think thereâ€™s anyone natural in zb1 without any filler or surgery (including veneers)? 

I guess from most to least with details imo is:
1. Hanbin (eyes, nose, chin, cheekbone reduction, accompanying facelift to reduce extra skin from shaved cheekbones (look at his ears), and like a little lip filler for his upper lip)
2. Zhanghao (chin, eyes, nose, veneers but like a good set)
3. Jiwoong (veneers but like a BAD set, filler, hair transplant)
4. Matthew (nose, chin, filler)
5. Ricky (chin, filler)
6. Taerae (eyes, nose)
7. Gyuvin (eyes)
8. Gunwook (eyes, potentially jaw)
9. Yujin (eyes)</p>

      <p>no gunwooks eyes and jaw have been the same he's only gotten filler in his nose tip and a potential alarplasty but I would put taerae above Ricky cuz his work is less invasive and gyuvins gotten a nose implant I'm p sure so he's higher too ermmm yujin idk I feel like his eyes and nose dermal filler. And interestingly enough I was talking ab haos teeth yesterday with friends they're natural imo he's a bottom ranker for teeth just cuz he has a natural square shape for all of them and his teeth are small. his eyes are I believe the same for him it's chin implant chin filler and nose dermal filler. Jiwoong never pegged me as a Turkish hairline bro but he might've gotten plugs elsewhere

      <p>tbh in kpop fillers and implants are like the norm here, so unless an idol has had an actual surgery, they're pretty natural to me. Also are hanbin mathew and taerae the only ones that went under a knife? If yes, more than half of the group is natural, they all either had one or two things done, its not even that much.</p>

      <p>I just consider it ps for this group cuz for the most part fillers and implants are what most everyone has. Technically you're going under the knife for an implant thoðŸ˜­ but uhhh hanbin taerae Matthew are the only ones I think that did smth fr fr
