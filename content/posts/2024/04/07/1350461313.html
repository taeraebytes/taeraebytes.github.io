      <p>Do you think there’s anyone natural in zb1 without any filler or surgery (including veneers)? 

I guess from most to least with details imo is:
1. Hanbin (eyes, nose, chin, cheekbone reduction, accompanying facelift to reduce extra skin from shaved cheekbones (look at his ears), and like a little lip filler for his upper lip)
2. Zhanghao (chin, eyes, nose, veneers but like a good set)
3. Jiwoong (veneers but like a BAD set, filler, hair transplant)
4. Matthew (nose, chin, filler)
5. Ricky (chin, filler)
6. Taerae (eyes, nose)
7. Gyuvin (eyes)
8. Gunwook (eyes, potentially jaw)
9. Yujin (eyes)</p>

      <p>no gunwooks eyes and jaw have been the same he's only gotten filler in his nose tip and a potential alarplasty but I would put taerae above Ricky cuz his work is less invasive and gyuvins gotten a nose implant I'm p sure so he's higher too ermmm yujin idk I feel like his eyes and nose dermal filler. And interestingly enough I was talking ab haos teeth yesterday with friends they're natural imo he's a bottom ranker for teeth just cuz he has a natural square shape for all of them and his teeth are small. his eyes are I believe the same for him it's chin implant chin filler and nose dermal filler. Jiwoong never pegged me as a Turkish hairline bro but he might've gotten plugs elsewhere

      <p>Taerae and Matthew have work done on their entire face, it's just more subtle and little tweaks Jiwoong doesn't have hair transplant and Hao only did his chin (very badly) and maybe something on his nose but not a nose job, I don't think Gyuvin and Gunwook have done anything, Yujin debuted very young so hard to tell cause some trainees get work done at like 12 but I don't see anything, I don't think Ricky has much fillers either I don't think Hanbin has had a lip filler either</p>

      <p>it's surprising everyone says taerae got a lot I personally don't see it but my oomfs who are into ps clocked so ig but yea hao didn't get a nose job it's just some filler to make it straighter. Gyuvin apparently did one of his eyelids cuz of a ptosis and I don't think gunjin have gotten much either yujin I just cant tell but yea and Ricky has just gone through weight loss bad styling and bad chin filler hanbins lips are still teensy so yea but he's gotten the most extensive work I believe

      <p>okay here I found some of taerae's school pics and I really don't think there's that much of a difference? his eyes look the same

      <p>Ok he definitely did his nose eyes I can't tell they're uneven and look pretty much the same so I guess just rhino and filler

      <p>Not the same anon o think hanbin had work done but I don’t think it’s sooo extreme to what people make out. I used to think like that but tbh when he’s barefaced and his eyebrows are out he still looks similar to himself post weightloss but pre debut. I think there are a few procedures he’s had done but I don’t think any were too extreme. Ntm most of his life has been documented online more so his dance life didn’t really have any big gaps in it so I don’t think he would have had time to heal from major surgeries. But minor ones yes I do think he got quite a few of those.</p>

      <p>Is like 2020-2022 not a big gap? During his training periods in cube and such but also you can take casts off and bruising goes down within a few months so there's time to appear and look decent. He looks like his old self with no makeup but the cheek work and rhino is obvious imo I haven't paid enough attention to notice small things
