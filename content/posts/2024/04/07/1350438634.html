      <p>Do you think there’s anyone natural in zb1 without any filler or surgery (including veneers)? 

I guess from most to least with details imo is:
1. Hanbin (eyes, nose, chin, cheekbone reduction, accompanying facelift to reduce extra skin from shaved cheekbones (look at his ears), and like a little lip filler for his upper lip)
2. Zhanghao (chin, eyes, nose, veneers but like a good set)
3. Jiwoong (veneers but like a BAD set, filler, hair transplant)
4. Matthew (nose, chin, filler)
5. Ricky (chin, filler)
6. Taerae (eyes, nose)
7. Gyuvin (eyes)
8. Gunwook (eyes, potentially jaw)
9. Yujin (eyes)</p>

      <p>no gunwooks eyes and jaw have been the same he's only gotten filler in his nose tip and a potential alarplasty but I would put taerae above Ricky cuz his work is less invasive and gyuvins gotten a nose implant I'm p sure so he's higher too ermmm yujin idk I feel like his eyes and nose dermal filler. And interestingly enough I was talking ab haos teeth yesterday with friends they're natural imo he's a bottom ranker for teeth just cuz he has a natural square shape for all of them and his teeth are small. his eyes are I believe the same for him it's chin implant chin filler and nose dermal filler. Jiwoong never pegged me as a Turkish hairline bro but he might've gotten plugs elsewhere

      <p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but Hao did nothing to his face. His eyes, nose and chin are the same with his predebut. Even his teeth aren't veneers. Those are his real teeth that suffered the braces from highschool to college and he's still wearing retainers to put his teeth, jaw and chin in place. Stop including Zh4</p>

      <p>Nope. Braces literally moves all your teeth to different places which changes the shape of your face. Hao still wears retainers coz his teeth moves if he doesn't wear them for a long time. With face as small as Hao's, even little movements can be seen. He did nothing to his face. His jaw, eyes and nose are still the same compared to his predebut.</p>
