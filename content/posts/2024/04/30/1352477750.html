      <p>This is one of three thing that knetz can't rationalize; the first is that text where bang pd says mhj has threatened him with OMG, the second is mhj insisting she wouldn't kill herself, and the third is that the cult and entities linked with the cult have name dropped and used bts as promo for years and hybe has never sued them</p>
