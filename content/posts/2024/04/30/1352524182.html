      <p>I'm excited for the concept but I'm tired of them having 0 backgrounds and of the close up shots who is their artistic director</p>

      <p>Ok but you have to understand why an ent company would have harder time finding staff because they can't hire fans. Like I'm sure so many talented zeroses could put real work into the group but it's a risk a huuuge safety risk so they probably look for people already seasoned in ent and or are struggling to even pay the ppl they have now
