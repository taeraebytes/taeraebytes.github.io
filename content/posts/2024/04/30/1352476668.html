      <p>i think some of the other fanart he reposted (some of it being untagged) was rt'd by that artist who's into rps so ppl speculate that he went through their account to see more fanart but i just think he looks through the #s and follows artists or gets them on his for you page. he probably has seen a bunch of rps shit tho like he's gotta be aware of haotmeal at this point</p>
