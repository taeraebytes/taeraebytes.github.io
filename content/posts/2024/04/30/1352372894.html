      <p>I don't think they understand the severity and obviously think kfans are in the wrong but the Reddit ones I've seen dance around the answer and the twt ones are oblivious or dumb ab it

      <p>nah some do know obviously given the fact that some reddit ppl brought it up but youâ€™ll get attacked by the fandom if you bring it up so people just stay quiet. iâ€™m more concerned about why we  canâ€™t really reach beyond the fandom internationally, jiwoongs issue isnâ€™t as big of a deal overseas but intl kpop stans that arenâ€™t zeroses just donâ€™t seem to care i think itâ€™s a lack of promotion and people writing them off after crush maybe</p>

      <p>There's a lot of factors it's not just this, the lack of promo, popular members being shelved (I get it but it's a pre release you'll live) no proper socmed promotion,  and I feel like everyone forgets zb1 has always had a very small intl fandom they have fandoms across many countries but outside of east Asia there's not much going for them and in fact there's more now than we ever had before. In general a culmination of wakeones actions and no real organization between fans (zeroses have just started to learn how to promote the group and actually participate in support like JUST and I mean ifans) and reputation scandal has brought us here. It's possible to turn back this isn't even close to the direness of September imo at least so when and if in the future they start getting carried by their large domestic fanbase generally it picks up morale and motivation. Crush was right after the fandoms largest loss and it was somewhat boycotted even then and managed to make numbers there's real power in dedication this was just bad moves packed into oneðŸ˜­ but let's hope for better. And yea ifans are very adamant on attacking they have a weird way of stanning it's rlly all or nothing which I admire but I can't publicly interact or be free in a space like that lol
