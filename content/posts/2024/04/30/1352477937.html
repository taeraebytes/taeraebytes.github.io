      <p>I always found it strange that hao in particular has such a crazy parasocial fanbase when he doesn't play into parasocialism nearly as much as the average idol, doesn't really share anything about his life, doesn't seem to even like to be victimized and coddled by his fan base and SHOWS IT, he's a very outspoken direct person..like why are they even like this at all?? 

I wonder if the post finale mess permanently made his fan base much more schizo because they feel like they know him on a very personal level? 
I find the psychology of Stan culture very interesting, it's easier to get the crazy jungkook nicki or Taylor swift fans because the artists play into parasocialsm a lot but it's a lot harder with the bp, aespa or in this case zh schizos</p>

      <p>I think with the whole overprotective attitude and cfan culture kind of spreading thru irosins as a result of his huuuge cfandom mixed with natural solo tendencies from survival show stanning u just kind of have the worst mix. And it's only really with irosins on twitter that I see which is so funny cuz mostly all they do is larp😭 both j and krosins are chiller and levelheaded and even if they have qualms it's rarely ever in a public setting and crosins have their own culture that they're used to and use entirely different platforms. And when you're in an environment like that where it's only yes men and like minded ppl only yea u just no longer have a basis in reality even to the point u create an image for ur bias. It's definitely not all rosins there are chill ones but there's an overwhelming almost majority thatre like this so it drowns out normalcy

      <p>I get it but cmiiw there was soooome logic to it since the previously postponed fansa would've been postponed again? and it was technically 1 member vs 2. But I can't talk what upsets you upsets you I pulled away from the fandom at my worst and was a solo fan for a while but I moved on at least the fancon rlly helped but I was already lightening up before anyways to each their own hope u have fun at least😆

      <p>Diff anon but same i did so much last album i was streaming like crazy i bought albums i was putting in the work not because of anyone but for Hao but the company has been unfair to him. and this fandom is so disgusting to him i just can't even bother to care for the group anymore,  from the racism to the vilification of rosins and acting like we are demons and not taking anything about our bias seriously, just today zeroses were making fun of rosins and telling them to kiII themselves because they we are worried about his health but didn't say anything about other fans being worried about their favs, discrediting his position and saying he's not a main vocalist i was shocked how many zeroses were shading him, and this is not even the tip of the icerberg of how my fav has been treated, this pre-release was the final nail in the coffin with complete main vocalist and center erasure like i truly couldn't give less of a fuck about the group even if i tried and i hope this song flops even harder (if that's even possible).</p>

      <p>You gotta feel for hao imagine he's sleeping 2 hours a day hustling all day cause he's actually passionate about being an idol, sick asfk, hyped up for the CB and then he goes home at night checks his phone and all he sees is his fans doomposting and being miserable like his mental health must take a hit
Honestly no shade towards Hanbin but at least I feel like Hanbin kinda eggs his fans but Hao not really man I feel bad</p>

      <p>I agree but also disagree I think hao does egg on fans too but does it in a different way I.e talking about the company or the small comments about certain things that he (may) know his fans are already schizophrenic about.</p>

      <p>maybe he does? I don't see much unless it's on my tl or brought to my attention but I've seen people twist his words as well like I don't think these people know who they stan half the time. His obvious jokes get taken in a complete opposite way and somehow we're back to doomposting like his incoherent apology thing in cn or when he talked ab the Istanbul airport or even saying he'd buy wakeone that didn't get doomposty but everyone took it as him saying a fuck u to the company😭????

      <p>He def does (and he is my bias) but it started kinda irk me recently? (He is still my bias). But his way of telling us things or serving something and his contrary as a damage control is really calculative and manipulative.</p>
