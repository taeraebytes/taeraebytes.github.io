      <p>which people do to everyone here and speculate😭😭 like if u disagree just send smth thru and make ur argument I virtually had no stance and was trolling. It's rlly as easy as that and people say random shit and troll for conversation it's rlly so evident a lot of people are new here and it's really starting to annoy me because I'm continuing to function how I always have UGHHHHHHHH LIKE PLZ GO BACK TO UR COMMUNITY and it was like 3 anons that does not mean the whole world agrees pretty much nothing posted should be taken at face value at the end of the day we operate out of boredom and for fun 🤦‍♀️ I wish I could write all this in my description but there's a 100 word limit
