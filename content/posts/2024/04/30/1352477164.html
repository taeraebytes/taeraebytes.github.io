      <p>gunwook doesn't have enough fics for me like mattwook has taken us to kingdom but what ab the other ships I like ðŸ˜’ I mean there isn't much to begin with but I'm ngl ppl fail to capture his personality half the time but as far as limitsðŸ¤”? like as in what ships? uhhhh idk I like gunwook yaoi but since it's not rlly a thing like that I'm not rlly strict on limits there's nothing but I started reading postypes instead that's the real teaaaaaa and they get me over there gyuwooks way bigger and it's gunreun YETHGAWD

      <p>i think itâ€˜sbecause ppl still think of gunwook as a minor till like 4 months ago and it feels like they sre being witchhunted if ur gonna write gunwook yaoi ðŸ˜… but i think i-fans/rpsers seem to open their eyes to geonreun recently ðŸ¥¹ the characterization in some fics is still kinda weird but itâ€˜s getting better lol</p>

      <p>maybe it's cuz I'm close in age with him I didn't understand it. But I didn't get why ppl called him a minor when they're not Korean or follow their age systemðŸ˜­ and then gyuvin also being an rps front runner even tho he's only like 3ish months older but you know what I cant change that. Ppl would irk so bad ab mattwook BRO WDNC and exactly sissss gunreun is the tea I just need them to get normal

      <p>i think it has more to do with the 3 years between matt and him than gunwook as an individual but imo it's not that serious but i see why ppl r hesitant to ship</p>

      <p>ehhhhhh idk 3 years to me isn't rlly weird that's only seen as weird by teens on the internet ngl + it never applied to his age mates but ofc if ppl feel a certain way you cant change that I understand

      <p>I feel like most people are okay with shipping him with Matthew gyuvin and Ricky, it gets a bit iffy with his other popular ship (gunhao, but only internationally as easy asians don't care) which I get because of their dynamic, I'm also seeing gunjin rise in the kfd but I think intl dans would be categorically against it</p>

      <p>gunjin ah nahðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ that's probably more taboo than gunhao but I'm glad everyone stopped being fake woke ab mattwook
