      <p>this is something really small and random but one thing i hate about zb1‚Äôs tiktok is that they take forever to post the challenges they do with other idols. i noticed this the past 2 eras but i feel like it‚Äôs gonna continue. like the other idol‚Äôs group tiktok will post the challenge they do with a zb1 member asap (eg wooah and riize) but if u were a non-fan and were to click on zb1‚Äôs @ in the caption expecting to see ur bias in turn do zb1‚Äôs challenge then it wouldn‚Äôt be there bc they just didn‚Äôt post it at the same time üò≠ like i feel like it‚Äôs just a miss of an opportunity. the purpose of these tiktoks is mostly to promote ur comeback to audiences who may not know the song otherwise and if the challenge with another fandom‚Äôs idol isn‚Äôt there then welp</p>
