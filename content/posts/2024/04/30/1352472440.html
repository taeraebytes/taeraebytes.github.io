If you will discriminate the center just because he is a foreigner, what's the point of making the survival show? Treat Zhang Hao properly. 

After enduring for the long time, all we got in return is short lines and hiding him at the back corner. Stop the trickery by offering the fake intro and ending and give him what he really deserves. 

Zhang Hao is a K-pop idol. Stop discrimination and support him with all schedules, Wakeone.” i’ve never seen them this straightforward about it</p>
