      <p>well looks more like most of them decided to boycott the album before the cbar put out the actual statement. buying 10k+ albums before and suddenly only having 98 orders is not normal.</p>

      <p>I’m confused why people are acting like they only decided to boycott yesterday, yes the statement was posted on twt abs re posted on their Weibo but you can do back to last week and they already said they aren’t opening special links. I even remember anon posting it here last week that his c bar made a statement saying they weren’t opening any special links. It was pretty obvious they were already boycotting because they sold 22k for mp so yeah I know his c fanbase is small but no one has that big of a drop unless they were already actively boycotting it. Also it’s not exactly boycotting it’s what the other c bars are doing, fans will still buy just not through the cbars.</p>

      <p>That's literally not true girl. they dropped a statement on twitter last week saying they will hide the sales = they knew they weren't gonna buy much. Meanwhile their statement today says they're going on a full boycott and discontinuation of purchasing any kind of group products and basically urging the fans to boycott too =\= what zhbar is doing which is just not posting the links meaning anyone can buy on their own. Please don't talk if you don't know how cbars work.</p>
