      <p>we remember but let's not act like he's not the third member to be called a favorite now ðŸ˜­ he's definitely served better than half of the group but there's no consistency with yall that's why I cant take u guys serious the only person I'm ever calling a favorite is jiwoong and it's been obvious since the beginning
