      <p>How I brutally view the members. Please tell me you agree and that I'm not insane.
1. Hao - skillful, but a little entitled, chin implant galore, can't pull off masc dances and always give off twink (which imo shows lack of variety, serving slay does not mean you shouldn't learn other styles and do those styles passably, don't come for me I'm gay), he's also very aware that his ship with Hanbin is insanely profitable and plays it up for views, he's a koreaboo.
2. Hanbin - repressed, insecure, but deep down genuinely sweet. Too sanitized. Plastic surgery done extremely well. Don't like his upright posture ingrained from his waacking days. I need him to reach a breaking point and act mean for once, it would be hot. Vocals overhyped.
3. Matthew - corny bbl messages, but funny. Feels like sometimes people are laughing at him and not with him so like :/. Singing voice way too nasally but gradual improvement. Good groove when dancing. A good presence in the group, down to earth. Seems the most approachable? 
4. Ricky - very insecure. Quiet but not bland, secretly funny af. Not on the spectrum, dude's just obviously lived in Cali. His style and persona is great marketing and him experimenting with make up means a lot more than most people realize. Needs to chill on chin filler. Very naive. Needs a stronger backbone and needs to set boundaries with Gyuvin. 
5. Gunwook - Depth. Thoughtful and genuinely multitalented. Talks too much at times. More self-conscious than what people think, shakes when nervous. A big portion of his confident bravado is him faking it til making it. Can rub insecure people the wrong away. Female face on male head and body. One of the only male idols I genuinely think can become someone worth admiring. He fascinates me ngl. Don't like the way he stands when presenting stuff, his feet are always pointed too far out.
6. Taerae - Needs to get better at dancing idc, at least don't be noticeably bad when doing group choreo. Very peculiar, conflicted about his personality. His twink moments are funny and he does cares for the members but he's also a clout goblin that would sabotage someone to get ahead, also feels like he would set higher expectations for others than himself. Great singing. Face is objectively cute. 
7. Gyuvin - Good intentions, horrible executions. Doesn't understand boundaries, probably facing the first identity crisis he's ever had rn. Privileged but not cocky. Has potential to grow into someone great. Does have a big heart, just surrounded with naivety. Get better at lipsyncing and singing, and strengthen that core when dancing plz. 
8. Jiwoong - Not even a member at this point, VENEERS, dating some chick. Doesn't even live in the dorms, not mindful of power dynamics with Yujin, and has a weird dancing style that is not adaptable and stands out in a bad way amongst the rest of the group. No facial expressions outside of blank stare and an odd sense of humor (not in a good way).
9. Yujin - that's just nephew</p>

Gunwook- I JUST JUMPED THANK UUUUUU IVE BEEN SAYING HE HAS A GIRL FACEEEE and agree he's a pretty antsy guy but it's impressive how he hides it. And wow agree like this is rlly a star don't dim his light... and yea his overturn when he stands 😭 I wonder if he's flat footed
Taerae- I think yea he's super noticeable but everyone gives him a pass for hard carrying as a main vocal I do too. 😭😭😭😭😭 ehys this description killing me him possibly setting higher standards for others not himself made me laugh
Gyuvin- agreeeeee
Jiwoong- yup and yes I don't wanna accuse him of anything but can this uncle chill on the whole throwing things at yujin bit😅? Agree I need him to stop dancing with his butt and stop the Botox
Yujin- my aegiiiiiiii icl I think he's now my favorite after gunwook it's been a slow rise these past few months
