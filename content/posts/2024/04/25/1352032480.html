      <p>I doubt they are run by akgaes since they were the ones helping gkjw with the trucks ect but their post was tone deaf. It was posted after the mv but before the performance  so they were saying it was disappointing to see the lack of screentime. I donâ€™t get how people are twisting it in the qrts saying they are boycotting though because they never mentioned boycotting or saying to not support because they are still rt and posting links to the stages and songs on different platforms.</p>
