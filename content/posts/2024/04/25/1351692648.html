      <p>Gunwook engagement is getting so better day by day ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç. I here for it, he is like 3rd or 4th most liked member I love how gunwook is getting appreciated by more people. What touches me most when a totally non fans who was not even zerose or solo stan defending gunwook because she loves him in BP and gunwook was her topic pick.</p>

      <p>The only concerning part for me is ricky, his twitter likes are in bottom along with jiwoong, taerae and gyuvin. I mean he barely post but still his engagement is going down üò¢ üò≠</p>
