      <p>I read shbg statement and although i don't mind them complaining like zeroses are just very hypocritical they think only them have the right to complain, i find it a bit absurd they said "he didnt start his part until later in the song" uhm he literally got the opening center? and even if he didn't i don't think that's a big issue because he got a really cool part with his tutting choreo and i thought that part was very interesting but whatever to each their own i guess</p>

      <p>I think a global releasing a disappointment statement in 3 seconds is kind of crazy to begin with especially hanbin global but I guess to each their own. I've never seen fanbases egg on fandom negativity ever I'm rlly experiencing a lot of firsts stanning this group

      <p>i think they can post whatever they want a global fanbase is not an official account. what was annoying was the timing like damn couldn't y'all wait even for a day to start complaining? at least hype up your fav's performance that he's been talking about all day.</p>

      <p>they're not official but uhm they're not fan accounts either they post professionally for a reason they're comprised of multiple departments and admins for a reason ðŸ˜­ but yea agree and not to mention his participation in the choreo
