      <p>It's crazy when u deep they have such a huge active domestic fandom that manages to grow still so like what the fuck is up bruh😭😭😭 I've seen the young student kfans talk ab their headphones being cut by their teachers and it's near impossible to stream and the quotes are confused too not even top 300 on genie is insidious. We rlly have to consider how much the lack of promo contributed the jiwoong screentime and lines and the squabble with rosallin fans but even then farrrrrrrrrrrrrr less popular groups chart better im trying to understand 😭 ig well just see what the stages do
