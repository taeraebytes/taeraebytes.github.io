      <p>why dont we have a system where a fanbase buys streaming accounts for k streaming services and intl fans stream using them? we’re a relatively big fandom and ive seen way smaller fandoms do it. i did it for dreamcatcher a while ago… it probably didnt help much but it’d be doing something… it would be relatively easy for any of the big voting accounts to implement</p>
