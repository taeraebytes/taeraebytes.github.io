      <p>Do you think they knew people were tweaking out over the mv because they released the performance video the same day but usually they release it a couple days to a week later</p>

      <p>well release is up to m2md(?) right? I doubt they did it after seeing reactions but I'm so glad they did because it helped a lot and they ended up charting on melon after it did😭😭😭😭 I think maybe this was predicted cuz ur right I've never seen a release this early and there was way more talk ab the perf video than the mv
