      <p>you have any korean anons? or korean speaking anons because I don't get why wakeone insists on giving jiwoong so many lines or at least prioritizing him imo his tone is so annoying to me but this may be because I'm not korean and don't understand korean so maybe korean ppl like that kind of tone?</p>
