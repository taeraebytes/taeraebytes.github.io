      <p>i have such good feelings about zb1 and their success rn i don’t wanna jinx it but it really feels like everything is looking up like i don’t think i’ve seen the fandom this consistently happy and united in so long and i feel like they’re gonna start finally getting the recognition they deserve from outside of the fandom too this group is too good not to. but like also i’m content if they’re not reaching like explosive levels of popularity like other rookies, it’s not a competition i just want zb1 to find their own path to kingdom</p>

      <p>this poor anon from 4 days ago... but I think they're up in positive engagement in general but earlier was a proper shit show🤦‍♀️. I cant gauge what sides have calmed what haven't but it's looking like kfans are calmed down after the performance video and I've just seen more ppl upset at akgaes and solo stans but they broke a record with iTunes that's smth 🙏. I still have a good feeling but I'll lower my expectations and ur right it's not a competition and they've made their mark and not going anywhere as a top 3 5th gen bg let's just enjoy what we have left 😊
