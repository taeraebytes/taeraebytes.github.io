      <p>as a queer person i feel so torn on him i am aware of the struggles he went through in the past as a gay man in korea but his whole brand is making often much younger men uncomfortable because he heavily flirts with and touches them? and then some have gotten called homophobic because of their reaction but no if it was a female host doing that they probably would be weirded the fuck out too. i can't tell if he is actually like that or plays it up because of the camera but i really hope zb1 don't go there, some of their hatred stems from homophobia anyways i don't think it's worth it to go send them to a different show can we get kstar next door again?</p>

      <p>Just the entire premise that I've seen from his show uhmmmm I'm ok I don't want zb1 to go there. it sucks he's using stereotypes to make a profit as a gay man but this is the same guy who did a university lecture and ended up discussing his sexuality speculations for boys planet trainees like this cornball can stay there IM COOL WHERE IM ATüòÇüôè
