      <p>nta but that anniversary video had the opposite effect on me like i was fine with the group since i know my bias would probably flop alone, but after watching it i realized i am too tired of this fandom and disbandment doesn't seem too badðŸ˜…</p>

      <p>i really feel this like i've never thought that the members didn't like each other and thats why i want them to disband asap it's more like the zb1 stan experience sucks so much ass that i don't really care if they're heartbroken if disbandment is our only opportunity for some change... like do we really want more years with horrible ass embezzling wakeone and proximity to crazy ass akgaes just because theyre gonna miss their friends? they can save each other's LINE ids and meet up on holidays ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Oh you must not know about the future that's awaiting them ðŸ˜­... u poor soul it's only gonna get worse after they disband. And for the most part once u block the akgaes stanning the group is fun asfk wakeone have upgraded to regular trifling kpop company status like I'm enjoying my time here but to each their own
