      <p>I read shbg statement and although i don't mind them complaining like zeroses are just very hypocritical they think only them have the right to complain, i find it a bit absurd they said "he didnt start his part until later in the song" uhm he literally got the opening center? and even if he didn't i don't think that's a big issue because he got a really cool part with his tutting choreo and i thought that part was very interesting but whatever to each their own i guess</p>

      <p>I think a global releasing a disappointment statement in 3 seconds is kind of crazy to begin with especially hanbin global but I guess to each their own. I've never seen fanbases egg on fandom negativity ever I'm rlly experiencing a lot of firsts stanning this group
