      <p>I don't like how global zeroses are dismissing kfans and acting like they don't need them or kcharts don't matter that much they need to get back to earth. Are you crazy if zb1 becomes like ateez or stray kids i'll kil myself plus this is almost 1 year old group who hasnt had a music show win outside the nugu shows and they're always saying how much they want to. we're kind of cooked if these are the charting numbers for the tt because they're promoting and kfans are streaming and the song is good, like there's really nothing that's gonna be that different except line distribution let's put hao and hanbin at the top because their kfans are still mad about it i keep seeing tweets about it today after watching their fancams complaining how they can't even see them properly. Please god we need this.</p>

      <p>Like I see the quotes of the Korean streaming acc and I feel so bad the kfans are disappointed as well it's not anything that was rlly in the fans control. Ig yes there is Control but it's pretty obvious why things are going the way they are god please take us back to our kingdom AND SET THINGS RIGHT. There's rlly no telling what we'll get with the tt but I hope we're all happy gosh
