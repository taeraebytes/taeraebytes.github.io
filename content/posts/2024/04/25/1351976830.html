      <p>What did you think? I love the song and the MV, maybe my fav song so far but I'm a little disappointed by the line distribution, I'm surprised even Korean fans are openly disappointed at least the song is very good tho</p>

      <p>I'm confused cause they SAW how riize got so much bigger after putting seunghan on hiatus but instead of keeping jiwoong on the low and promoting the members who can actually sing they gave him so much lines??? Ofc we're gonna struggle to chart like this...let's hope the tt is good with better distribution, but considering everyone was sick idk..at least the songs is really good</p>
