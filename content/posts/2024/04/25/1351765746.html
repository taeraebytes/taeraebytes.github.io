      <p>I forgot to respond to an anon earlier they sent the bit ab yujins part in gyuvins letter it does seem like they're going thru a rough patch or just a relationship change. No doubt they're close but like he said they're too different so they clash + a lot of the very early gyujin stuff was played up for debuting reasons so that plays into the difference now
