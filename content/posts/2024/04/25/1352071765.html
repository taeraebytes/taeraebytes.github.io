      <p>The biggest thing is jiwoong but hao being on the low def made things worse it's not that the distribution fucked the charts upðŸ˜­ and since a huge chunk of kzeroses are students who can no longer stream at school they rise late at night when they come home that's why they just peaked on melon. Let's pray for another rise then freeze
