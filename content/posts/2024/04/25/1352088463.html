    "question": "yeah pretty much, its about how they connect their moves. Hao is typically a fluid dancer and he treats the moves as all one fluid motion while hanbin emphasizes sharpness in his dancing typically and makes sure each move is distinct. I think its the easiest to tell in the body roll they do, Hao makes a more fluid wave through his body while you can see each individual isolation in Hanbin's body roll. Also something I find interesting is how they emphasized the music with the roll, Hao emphasized the downbeat with his chest pump and then let the wave slowly flow through his torso regardless of the rest of the beats and kind of let it linger while Hanbin didnt put as much emphasis on that downbeat but instead emphasized every syllable in that little phrase and quickly went to the next move  (probably because he was moving to another formation while hao wasnt). But yeah I think the contrast between their dance styles is so cool I love watching them together MORE HAOBIN DUO DANCES PLEASE",
