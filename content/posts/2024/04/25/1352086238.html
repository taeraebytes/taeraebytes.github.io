 hmm this statement literally just proved that it was hard and taxing for the members to do that part of the choreo right? and that’s why they changed it? i wonder if it was after they filmed the performance video which was long before the release since hao still has freshly pink hair. u can see in their recent stage that hanbin wasn’t leaning into him that much anymore so i think they changed it</p>
