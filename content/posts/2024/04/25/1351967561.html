    "question": "It sucks that theyâ€™re a survival show group bc if the fans were normal no one would be upset apart from gunwook fans imo. The MV was cute, the song is really good and the members are happy so why canâ€™t we ever just be excited too. Hopefully everyone can just be satisfied for once and stopping deciding whether u like the song or not based on where ur member places on the line distribution board. I pity gunwook fans tho, i donâ€™t think heâ€™s ever gotten a decent amount of lines for himself.",
    "reply": "this is from hours ago but... yea idk watchinf the mv was stomach churning but his onomatopoeia chorus part might take us to heaven like who knows maybe there's tea in not actually saying wordsðŸ¤” sucks tho you'll never hear them complain cuz a they're too scared or b don't like to down moods and c get drowned out by schizophrenia. I think most gunwook fans are fine at this point they're used to it but dang I need certain folks to actually get over themselves asap ðŸ˜­"
