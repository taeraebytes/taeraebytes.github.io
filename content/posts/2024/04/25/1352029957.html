      <p>well looks more like most of them decided to boycott the album before the cbar put out the actual statement. buying 10k+ albums before and suddenly only having 98 orders is not normal.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m confused why people are acting like they only decided to boycott yesterday, yes the statement was posted on twt abs re posted on their Weibo but you can do back to last week and they already said they arenâ€™t opening special links. I even remember anon posting it here last week that his c bar made a statement saying they werenâ€™t opening any special links. It was pretty obvious they were already boycotting because they sold 22k for mp so yeah I know his c fanbase is small but no one has that big of a drop unless they were already actively boycotting it. Also itâ€™s not exactly boycotting itâ€™s what the other c bars are doing, fans will still buy just not through the cbars.</p>
