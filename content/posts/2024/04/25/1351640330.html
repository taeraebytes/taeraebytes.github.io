      <p>I actually think this is their best cover after energetic, it's really good the only big weakness is the rap but well what else can jiwoong and gyuvin do..I just hope gunwook gets a full verse one day, Hanbin was so cunty and I thought haos voice sounded beautiful in roses parts I wish it was longer I actually want a cunty concept now</p>
