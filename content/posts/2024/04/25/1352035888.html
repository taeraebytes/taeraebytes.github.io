      <p>you have any korean anons? or korean speaking anons because I don't get why wakeone insists on giving jiwoong so many lines or at least prioritizing him imo his tone is so annoying to me but this may be because I'm not korean and don't understand korean so maybe korean ppl like that kind of tone?</p>

      <p>I'm not even mad if sweat don't chart well (ofc I'm gonna be salty af because it's actually a good song and one of my faves) but if this is the wake up call wakeone needs to stop prioritizing him then I'm fine with it because it's a pre release after all, please don't fuck up the actual comeback JEBALLLLLL 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I'd like to think wakeone is just 'testing the waters' to see how the gp views jw after some time had past but obviously it's still fucking bad so now they know what NOT to do for the actual comeback. Every time I saw him get a slow mo face shot in the mv I was sighing because I can already hear ssibal from knets and he got so mannyy fcking solo shots 😭</p>

      <p>The comeback is in 3 seconds you better hope those locked in prayers evaded everything from the start😟 well let's just wait and see cuz ig u could say this is them testing but the songs were recorded pre scandal and it's true they were doing jpn promos or just ia till now but even a squirrel would know what the waters think so... all I can do is pray
