      <p>confused cuz he's not even in the bottom with lines even tho there are mere second differences and he had a whole choreo highlight his fans are the last people to be upset and they should listen to things he actually says not whatever they've made up in their heads like ?

      <p>og anon well I'm talking about hanbin because his bubble msgs and boycott happened hours from another and happened today whereas hao and yujin we been knew they gonna boycott, like we knew yujin was gonna boycott since march. the reason why I mentioned bubble is because again they proceeded with the boycott after his bubble msgs like they coulda decided not to or hold off the boycott after reading his bbl msgs because they're his fans yet they still continued to proceed with the boycott so in the end they care more about themselves then hanbins wishes. 

AGAIN I'm talking about hanbin only because it happened today idk why u bitches always bring up other members like we talking about pancakes and you wanna talk about waffles</p>
