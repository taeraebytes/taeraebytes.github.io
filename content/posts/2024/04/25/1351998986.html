      <p>for me it's cuz I realized gunwooks in the song more than I thought and I think the same for everyone else but damn what's wrong w them this is the first time everyone's liked the choreo. ALSO I think you can still be upset I'm still coping and I was so mad I think the maddest I've been in AGES when I first watched but 1) I get annoyed when ppl get a specific type of doomposty like sure u can say they're doing bad rn but I hate when ppl try to be like "yup told u they're tanking haha what happens when my bias doesn't get 1 minute of lines and the entire mv stupid girl stupid group stupid fandom" like please be normal yuck.. and 2) the songs actually stuck in my head and I feel bad the whole group was so excited for this crush rlly traumatized them and I feel so sorry like wow I wish I could fix everything 😭💔 and gunwook was so nervous so I'm like lemme be calm and keep my complaints with my circle we only glaze round these parts!!! That's just me but everyone's different I hope u feel better cuz I get u
