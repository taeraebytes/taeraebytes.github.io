    "reply": "this poor anon from 4 days ago... but I think they're up in positive engagement in general but earlier was a proper shit show🤦‍♀️. I cant gauge what sides have calmed what haven't but it's looking like kfans are calmed down after the performance video and I've just seen more ppl upset at akgaes and solo stans but they broke a record with iTunes that's smth 🙏. I still have a good feeling but I'll lower my expectations and ur right it's not a competition and they've made their mark and not going anywhere as a top 3 5th gen bg let's just enjoy what we have left 😊"
