      <p>Tbh the Zhbar probably put out that statement because they cannot buy as many albums as before. There are some new rules about shipping from Korea to China. A lot of Groups Cbars suffered from it. I think that Zhcbar is just ashamed to admit that fact and thatâ€™s why they put out that statement. If their numbers are lower than normally they can just say we "boycotted". Cfans love to surpass their past numbers, if they canâ€™t, things like these happen.</p>

      <p>Oh there's an issue with shipping now? This kind of does make sense because in the past even when rosins were mad they still bulk bought like the with the whole lofficiel thing and broke a record
