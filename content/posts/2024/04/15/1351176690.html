      <p>for "fingering" at the aiport. total breakdown: ricky did bitna pose to taerae and hanbin at the airport, the same pose other members and he himself has done before > 13 year old dumbass tiktok stans started spreading that it's a "dirty gesture" > their reaction reached pann > pannchoa posted about it > now ricky is getting called incel pervert by kpop stans. anon can go to hell btw, he isn't anything like gyuvin. he literally didn't't do anything wrong except have dumbass porn brained fans who like to spend misinformation for "fun". congrats for getting him dragon for nothing. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes completely mia after this</p>
