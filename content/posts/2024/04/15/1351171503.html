      <p>Lowkey same for environmental reasons and artistic reason the focus on the pobs versus the actual art books and albums pisses me off so much I love album collecting more and when there's good design and graphics ugh it rlly doesn't get better than that like we need more appreciation for albums

      <p>Yeah it's crazy how much the artistic value in kpop has decreased like okay the industry has never really been about music but at least there was great visual value, it almost feels like a laundering money scheme the way everything got so lazy</p>
