      <p>We're not crush still would have done over 1.5million preorders without zhbar and that was with a week of links rather than a month and no offline raffle system with a 200 album minimum that we have now

      <p>Sorta kinda in riizes case 1 million in a week was just plain impossible and their numbers were probablt 100k or less and it took them until January to ACTUALLY achieve that + fudging numbers has always been a thing but if the companies buy it from the stores themselves it's technically still a sale for riize idt sm even had the alleged 1M albums printed or out of the factories
