      <p>You wanna talk about some home grown beef? I've been a fan of Jiwoong since 2016 (YES WHEN HE DEBUTED IN INX, I HAVE PICS OF MY FANART OF HIM FROM 2016 TOO) and like I messaged him on insta in 2018/19 and he saw and liked one of my messages... tell me why almost everything he does annoys me know like his neck is too stiff when he dances his singing is not improving he's awkward with the members he only has one facial expression and he really does not fit in with the group... this was the man I was a fan of for like 7 years even when he was nugu af and not even the fujoshi's knew about him but the second I saw how off his interactions were with Yujin I could not stand him anymore and it's like a switch flipped. I mean this with probably as much weight as possible but zb1 would be better without him and that's coming from someone who supported him ever since he originally debuted and like that sucks so much to vocalize but it really feels like that's the truth</p>

      <p>For me outside of being generally unskilled and not passionate (I can forgive lacking skills if you at least show some fire and willingness to improve for ex gyuvin) hes really all around bad vibes, you can tell the members are uncomfortable around him and don't like him esp jjangyuz and he's been rude a few times towards them and to me it seems deeper than him just not living with them</p>

      <p>Yeah to me it has never been just about not living with him like yeah forgetting to talk about him when they talk about the rest of the group in that case makes sense, but some members seem to actively dislike him, I don't think they're actually beefing my theory is that he's been rude a lot and some members don't vibe w him because of it but don't confront him</p>

      <p>Yea it's very likely he just doesn't match with them doesn't make effort and can be overall offputting
