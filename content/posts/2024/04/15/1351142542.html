      <p>as someone who thinks hb is more attracted to men, i think he appreciates beauty like anyone else but stright men around pretty girls they either avoid contact and keep distance in front of the camera like most male idolss or act super creepy. the fact he could be so close in taking tiktok with karina and the way he was around wonyoung i dont think he;s into women in straight men way</p>

      <p>I'm a hanbin bias but I don't see it at all personally, I would actually be actively surprised if he got with a woman. Then again bisexuality is very common in the entertainment industry I'm always surprised at the number of DL bi celebrities</p>

      <p>yea that's why I bestow him with the bisexual male leaning title but bisexuality can get tricky in a homophobic society like this one because usually once you've swung one way openly you can't swing back it's why ppl say it doesn't exist there ðŸ˜­

      <p>i'm also hanbin biased and i feel like ppl want him to bi bc they're attracted to him and he's 'less obviously gay' bc of his prince charming image/flower boy visual LMFAO like outside of fan service that everyone has to do towards fans is there much in the way of bi. like i mean he could be but that's the vibe i get from it all</p>

      <p>He's giving bi but things like the bra photoshoot w his girls only team or hitting the butt of two female friends would be a little weird but maybe he's just super super friendly regardless of gender but idk</p>

      <p>his interactions w his friends I'm not gonna judge that's their own boundaries and the girls didn't seem to care but he was in an artistic space like that I'm not rlly surprised a lot of his dance teammates have girlfriends as well
