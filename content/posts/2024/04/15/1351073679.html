      <p>as someone who thinks hb is more attracted to men, i think he appreciates beauty like anyone else but stright men around pretty girls they either avoid contact and keep distance in front of the camera like most male idolss or act super creepy. the fact he could be so close in taking tiktok with karina and the way he was around wonyoung i dont think he;s into women in straight men way</p>
