    "question": "Most idols have hate accs dedicated to them.

And female idols in general receive way more hate than men yet still donâ€™t let haters bring them down and they donâ€™t break under the pressure. literally everyone in K-pop industry gets shitted on, get falsely accused of crimes and become victims of a mass targeted attack but confident ppl continue to shine and rise higher. U just canâ€™t address the situation adequately when it comes to ur bias yet, like thereâ€™s nothing wrong in admitting heâ€™s insecure af cuz thatâ€™s the truthðŸ¥² and if u canâ€™t handle the truth u r insecure as well.

    "reply": "let it get to his head.. did gunwook confide and tell u that it got to his head? he just read the comments reacted like a normal human being continued and ended the live nicely? Did he come on his bubble and start crying? no he just kept it pushing this is his fan complaints cuz that's wtf we're gonna do.. please don't get up on here and try to weaponize what wonyoungs been thru to get ur point across about hate and in the same breath invalidate what gunwooks been thru and play oppression Olympics with two members that 1 don't get half the shit u claim and 2 someone who quite literally are the reason for their own hate. When did this ever become a conversation of hate that male idols receive vs the hate that female idols receive? What does that have to do with what u said if you don't have a sound argument just say that instead of writing me word salad ab a weak ass point you've convinced urself is worthy enough to carry through into a discussion. Never did I say gunwook isn't insecure it's evident he is and it's evident why but to act like the hate comments he got on his own paid service meant just for his fans that he can directly see in real time is ALL he's been through? yea not only are you tapped you're genuinely just not smart. And yes this is objective because this is just the plain truth but you know what let's wait for that taerae hate train you speak of to start. Oh and dedicated hate accounts with that many followers isn't common angdakkjung and uklob have almost the same amt of followers good day beloved"

      <p>Some members have it way worse jiwoong is being bombed with dts, targeted and harassed by knetz yet still standing strong, hao and taerae get bullied for the smallest things but theyâ€™re not letting the antis get to their head while gunwook sees one hate comment and itâ€™s the end of the world for him, u r just so delusional and have blurred vision when it comes to himðŸ˜­ that mf is insecure no wonder him and gyuvin got so close, birds of a feather flock together</p>
