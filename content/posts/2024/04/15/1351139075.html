      <p>shit. the other cc sent without me finishing my message and with a typo too so ignore that.

does anyone knows which connections kq (ateez company) has?

like during kingdom they were the group that was getting a bigger budget and a whole controversy started bc of it, they get invited to coachella, now they are performing at yonsei festival which we know it's a big gig in korea, they also got invited to supersonic which it's a big festival in Japan.</p>
