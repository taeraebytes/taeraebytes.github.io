      <p>Imo the sales will be more than fine, just take a look at their japanese single, they're about to reach 600k soon and that was their debut. We should worry about their prerelease because it will either make or break them, and with bnd achieving good results now and riize coming soon, they need to make a name for themselves.</p>

      <p>Based on the choreo spoil only it seems like a sexy concept, but im not entirely sure if they should do that since there‚Äôs a minor in the group. And where are the fucking photos man? Some ppl are saying this cb feels rushed and i honestly do think so too, it seems very unplanned and random from the posters to the pre order day. Praying that they used the money from previous albums for a good song/MV üôè</p>
