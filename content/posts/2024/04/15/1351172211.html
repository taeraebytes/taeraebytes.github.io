    "question": "honestly what makes me feel bad for cfans is that the mnet platform can only be accesed with vpn from china unlike bubble (even hao mentioned that) so they are going to have to find alternative ways to pay for the new mnet bubble thing and constantly use vpn for it which is so unfair since zb1 (esp hao and yujin) has a big percentage of cfans, so yk on top of everything they essentially cut off the “legal” way to communicate with members, if the company doesn’t have any considaration for cfans it’s totally fair for them to not want to contribute millions into the sales",
    "reply": "Yea I think it's unfair to mnets so lazy the apps interface is shit and crashes constantly ugh idky they insisted on this dud app but I feel for them. The thing is tho a lot of things are censored in China so I'm not rlly sure if the issue comes from mnet, the app developers, the launch etc I'm sure there's more factors to it and an app like bubble came from sm who's probablt way better equipped and started this for their artists and launched initially when wayv were only promoting in china and weverse is hybe so idk"
