    "question": "Well zb1 need sales now more than ever, they aren't known by the gp and their music doesn't chart that well compared to other popular groups, they're no longer rookies so the only awards they can dream of getting at award shows this year are beonsangs and that depends on them having very good sales. If the cbars boycott that's another story",
    "reply": "Ok the gp never knew them to begin with and the only bgs charting better than them are riize and tws yall they're fine crush did bad (that being mid 50-60s ðŸ˜­ numbers ppl dream of btw) because fans refused to stream they chart better than nmixx I think that says smth lollll u guys gotta get ur head out of this doom gutter like who cares"
