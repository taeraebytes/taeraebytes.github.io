      <p>Sometimes I think about how zb1 were actually from a big enough company like these are the ones I can think of rn
1. Company stans will check them out and either turn into a casual or an actual fan
2. Their issues would have been dealt way differently like for one they would have made jiwoong apologize for that matter
3. SONG PRODUCTION QUALITY 
4. They would utilise the popular members a lot
5. You'd see many articles regarding their achievements on a lot of sites and forums
6. The GP would have actually tuned it cuz they're from a big agency.
7. They will have great choreo to match the songs as well
8. Will utilise the members talent accordingly 
9. Sending them on famous or trendy variety shows
10. Brand deals 
12. Tiktoks with popular senior artists</p>
