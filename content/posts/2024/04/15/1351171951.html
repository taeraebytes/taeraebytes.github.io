    "question": "the 200 album raffle is a mistranslation. the english notice just says that out of everyone who buys the album using the mnet plus link 200 of those people will be selected to attend the showcase, not that you have to buy 200 albums to get in lol. it's still promoting bulk buying though since fans will buy more to try and get in but it's just like fansigns",
    "reply": "Ohhhh I see it now I misread purchasers as purchases ok I was think a 200 minimum was insane to begin withðŸ˜­ but yea still super money grabby"
