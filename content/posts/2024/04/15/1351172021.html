      <p>Tbh the Zhbar probably put out that statement because they cannot buy as many albums as before. There are some new rules about shipping from Korea to China. A lot of Groups Cbars suffered from it. I think that Zhcbar is just ashamed to admit that fact and thatâ€™s why they put out that statement. If their numbers are lower than normally they can just say we "boycotted". Cfans love to surpass their past numbers, if they canâ€™t, things like these happen.</p>

      <p>Oh there's an issue with shipping now? This kind of does make sense because in the past even when rosins were mad they still bulk bought like the with the whole lofficiel thing and broke a record

      <p>Crosins dgaf about the group's sales anymore ðŸ˜­ they're fed up with wakeone and rightfully so the point of this statement is to let them know they'll stop blindly supporting the group while getting disrespected</p>

      <p>they're fed up i get that everyone is fed up it's not an exclusive thing tho. And I get the sentiment of not wanting to support the company but the lines become confusing since the product the company is managing is the very group we support its muddled but it's not even essentially a boycott and there's still a large chunk of fans thatll end up financially supporting
