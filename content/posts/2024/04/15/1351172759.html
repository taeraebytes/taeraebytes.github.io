      <p>Lowkey same for environmental reasons and artistic reason the focus on the pobs versus the actual art books and albums pisses me off so much I love album collecting more and when there's good design and graphics ugh it rlly doesn't get better than that like we need more appreciation for albums

      <p>Yeah it's crazy how much the artistic value in kpop has decreased like okay the industry has never really been about music but at least there was great visual value, it almost feels like a laundering money scheme the way everything got so lazy</p>

      <p>Right everything got lazy once companies realized it didn't matter how the albums looked or what they consisted of they stopped caring I just want a good designed photobook or cover I genuinely appreciate that more than pcs

      <p>Yup same I was just talking about this with my sister in regards to NCT dream id rather a comeback with a song and concept I don't like but has genuine artistic value and thoughts put into it like hot sauce than something lazy like their latest cb, same for BTS w their last group cbs nothing more insulting to music than lazy cash grabs</p>

      <p>Ok well not a song and concept I don't likeðŸ˜… but like it's such a turn off when there's no effort in album design but wow this is really why till this day tbz maverick will always forever be my favorite era and comeback. The concept and the work put into that cb was genuinely insane and the members own involvement in creating the artbook like it rlly broke my heart what happened to them after that but it was so good and they commissioned an artist for their poster ugh just amazing
