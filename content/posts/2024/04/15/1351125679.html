      <p>I feel like shkmongz will never go back to the way they were in bloom- crush era, everything changed after that I feel they stopped having fun with it and are too concious about each other now. In a delulu mindset maybe one of them got too into it , i dont really think the fans getting annoyed thing was an actual factor tbh</p>
