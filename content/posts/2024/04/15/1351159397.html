      <p>they all opened during crush. they will open again. cbars cant leave their cfans hanging. its really difficult to get albums otherwise. they are probably just waiting for more info like the concept photos and stuff. yura yura was disspointing but it was a japanese release so i hope that this korean comeback will push zb1 to the top. we need all arms out and legs out (except yujins). thats what the general kpop fan wants to see</p>
