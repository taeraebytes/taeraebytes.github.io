      <p>has a boycott in kpop ever changed things management wise? the only one i can think about on top of my head is loona's boycott. wk1 has messed up a lot and they will probably keep on doing so knowing how understaffed they are. so i'm not hopeful there will be any change especially if zb1 still sell a lot (plus the fact they're a temp group)</p>

      <p>I'm ngl I've never heard of a successful kpop boycott it never goes through ever so I don't even think I could tell you if one changed anything there's a difference between fan retaliation and boycott the fans retaliate all the time and can get change or responses. I think you can be hopeful like there's already very obvious positive change now compared to during in bloom and with the swing merge well probablt get more employees
