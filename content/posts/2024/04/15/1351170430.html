      <p>Imo the sales will be more than fine, just take a look at their japanese single, they're about to reach 600k soon and that was their debut. We should worry about their prerelease because it will either make or break them, and with bnd achieving good results now and riize coming soon, they need to make a name for themselves.</p>
