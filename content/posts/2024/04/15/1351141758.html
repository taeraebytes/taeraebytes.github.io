      <p>as someone who thinks hb is more attracted to men, i think he appreciates beauty like anyone else but stright men around pretty girls they either avoid contact and keep distance in front of the camera like most male idolss or act super creepy. the fact he could be so close in taking tiktok with karina and the way he was around wonyoung i dont think he;s into women in straight men way</p>

      <p>I'm a hanbin bias but I don't see it at all personally, I would actually be actively surprised if he got with a woman. Then again bisexuality is very common in the entertainment industry I'm always surprised at the number of DL bi celebrities</p>

      <p>yea that's why I bestow him with the bisexual male leaning title but bisexuality can get tricky in a homophobic society like this one because usually once you've swung one way openly you can't swing back it's why ppl say it doesn't exist there ðŸ˜­

      <p>Tbh there's a lot more kcelebs that are bi than I thought, but then again if you're bi in east Asia you'd usually choose to go with the opposite gender for simplicity sake I mean even fully gay and lesbians go for the opposite gender</p>
