      <p>It has nothing to do with that he barely have 200k follower in weibo i mean you have to be like crazy fans to buy album, 780K album vs less than 200k followers not adding up. You are buying album but not following him on weibo? What I meant was one fans is purchasing multiple times. I have against hao im haobin stan.</p>
