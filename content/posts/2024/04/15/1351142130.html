      <p>Wakeone is so funny lmao doing everything to inflate the sale cause wdym choosing 500 random people who bought 200+ albums... like that's literally telling the fans to mass buy they probably know their sales will decline every big boy group sales declined ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Well zb1 need sales now more than ever, they aren't known by the gp and their music doesn't chart that well compared to other popular groups, they're no longer rookies so the only awards they can dream of getting at award shows this year are beonsangs and that depends on them having very good sales. If the cbars boycott that's another story</p>
