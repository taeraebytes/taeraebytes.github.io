      <p>Idk if they are fbuddies or not but I was there when RosÃ© private leaked and it was the time on where Instagram let you search the followers in verified accounts and she was following Eunwoo, she was also following Mingyu.</p>

      <p>Well she was only following Mingyu and Eunwoo. No signs of Yugyeom, Jungkook, or the others. I remember that she was also following Song Kang. But she didn't follow a lot of people there so I am guessing that yeah they probably hung out</p>

      <p>song kang and mingyu are friends so maybe they're some lil friend group (+ maybe with eunwoo? or that could be a separate friendship idk) but why's she only with eunwoo and mingyu and not the other 97z like what's teaaaaaaaaaaa. i've heard that the female (i think that's jihyo, mina, minnie, lisa and some others) and male 97z are all friends with each other, it's not as separate as what appears in the public, but i wonder what the exact friendships are</p>

      <p>RosÃ© seems to prefer actors/actresses. She doesn't have that many idol friendships so that's why her following Mingyu and Eunwoo was kinda ðŸ‘€</p>
