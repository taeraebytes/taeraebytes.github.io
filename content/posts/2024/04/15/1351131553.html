      <p>ok so let's now discuss enhypen they seem kinda shady, what rumors do they have?

I know about Jake picking girls at itaewon, I also know that the person who exposed him also said that Jay does that too and that Sunghoon goes with them but he doesn't pick girls bc he has a gf.

I know about that Fromis_9 Baek Jiheon x Sunghoon rumor and she ended up denying it on weverse but omg it was kinda convincing bc she really was looking at him and giggling while he was also giggling at her and didn't look miserable for once during his mc gig. But at the same time I feel like Sunghoon is one of those idols that it's kinda nugu but he still pulls a lot of female idols, like that video of Yuna trying to flirt with him was kinda convincing too, plus he even gets mentioned by male idols for being good looking so mhm.

Sunoo is obviously gay as hell.</p>

      <p>Yeah you know how fromis has lots of male fans? Well baek jiheon is the one with the most male fans and on those weird ass korean male forums she's one of the idols that get mentioned the most so when that happened a lot of people came to her weverse and hated on her, so she did a post saying "During the interview, I had so much fun with Saerom unnie and Nakyung unnie. I only saw Flover,  let‚Äôs only see each other.‚Äù she was talking about the music bank interview but idk you can go and search the video it's clear that she was giggling at him and he was doing the same</p>
