A lot of Groups Cbars suffered from it. I think that Zhcbar is just ashamed to admit that fact and that’s why they put out that statement. If their numbers are lower than normally they can just say we \"boycotted\". Cfans love to surpass their past numbers, if they can’t, things like these happen.",
