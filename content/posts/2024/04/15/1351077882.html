      <p>Anon what are you talking about pann is the same account that blades the rinabin dating thing and his past dance videos 💀 they clearly will post anything about him that’s trending they even posted that rumour from the other day the only reason it wasn’t negative is because all the comments on the original article were dragging op and it was mass downvoted because no one believed it</p>

      <p>Yeah if anything it looks like they like Ricky but dislike hanbin cause they would tl tons of negative posts about him back in bp (then again she would tl negative articles about everyone but Ricky back then, she doesn't really care about zb1 she just wants clicks) riize were literally her banner right before hanbin and they were paying her rent w the negative articles 😭</p>

      <p>Lol I actually have tea for this, but its not related to the English pann choa. Before zb1 debuted pann was really friendly with Ricky, kinda carried his kvotes too while hanbin got shit on daily. So after the final, hanbin fans decided to take revenge for pann hating him by posting anti posts against all the remaining members with topics about hating other members' looks, nationality, saying because of the Chinese, Korean male idols have to join the army, or say that members make money in Korea but don't serve Korea, or this and that members dance poorly or don't get along with the group because they just want to debut with their own company's trainees... The problem is that they didn't post a post praising Hanbin because they know he will get shit on,  instead  they cursed the other members and manipulating the comments section to always praise Hanbin . They were like that from the final night until July when they were exposed and everything stopped, but by then the entire group was already so hated by Pann, kzerose kinda avoided to post there</p>
