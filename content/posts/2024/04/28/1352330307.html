      <p>gunwook doesn't have enough fics for me like mattwook has taken us to kingdom but what ab the other ships I like ðŸ˜’ I mean there isn't much to begin with but I'm ngl ppl fail to capture his personality half the time but as far as limitsðŸ¤”? like as in what ships? uhhhh idk I like gunwook yaoi but since it's not rlly a thing like that I'm not rlly strict on limits there's nothing but I started reading postypes instead that's the real teaaaaaa and they get me over there gyuwooks way bigger and it's gunreun YETHGAWD

      <p>i think itâ€˜sbecause ppl still think of gunwook as a minor till like 4 months ago and it feels like they sre being witchhunted if ur gonna write gunwook yaoi ðŸ˜… but i think i-fans/rpsers seem to open their eyes to geonreun recently ðŸ¥¹ the characterization in some fics is still kinda weird but itâ€˜s getting better lol</p>

      <p>maybe it's cuz I'm close in age with him I didn't understand it. But I didn't get why ppl called him a minor when they're not Korean or follow their age systemðŸ˜­ and then gyuvin also being an rps front runner even tho he's only like 3ish months older but you know what I cant change that. Ppl would irk so bad ab mattwook BRO WDNC and exactly sissss gunreun is the tea I just need them to get normal
