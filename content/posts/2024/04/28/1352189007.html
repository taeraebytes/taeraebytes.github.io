      <p>LMAO they have jiwoong so the chances are high but since MC is cringe and extremely weird as hell so chances are 50-50 because they also have yujin who is minor</p>

      <p>idt him liking that necessarily means anything.... idk what it is but i've noticed korean public figures just seem to like every damn comment on their own youtube, instagram or tiktok. maybe it's to show they've seen the message but ppl always act like it's a huge thing and then you'll see they've liked every comment so it means nothing. she's not korean but it reminds me of when yurina from gp999 liked a rude comment on tiktok, forgot the context but anyway she got lots of shit but clearly she or her social media manager was liking just about anything</p>

      <p>i watched the episode with riize and all that guy did was glaze them and make them mildly uncomfortable so idk why everyone rallies for zb1 to go thereâ€¦ well  i do tbh and itâ€™s because none of them actually watch or care about the show, and only got exited bc heâ€™s gay even though heâ€™s the worst type of representation (his life story is very admirable, itâ€™s just his tv persona is a collection of stereotypes)
and i donâ€™t want to see hao there because it will just bring back all of the stuff and he will get dragged by homophobic trolls again</p>
