girl just rants non stop ðŸ’€ it's exhausting to hear and unnecessary

I hate how it's comeback season and people are more obsessed with inconsequential slights over promoting the song they worked so hard for and had to convince the company to release. We need to stop lying about how it's only wakeone sabotaging the fandom growth because so many solos do not care about about making it a positive or fun place to be.</p>
