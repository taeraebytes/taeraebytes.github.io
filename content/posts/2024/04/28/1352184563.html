      <p>if it makes it any better i'm pretty sure groups aren't nominated in the week that they release, they start being elligible the week after (so after promos for sweat end so that def isn't getting a win, but we already knew that lmao) but yeah i hope zb1 can bag a win for the title track please please pleaseeeeeeee</p>
