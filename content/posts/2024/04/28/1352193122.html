      <p>Can't reply but to gaslighting anon: Just because stanning has been normalised doesn't mean it is normal behaviour, being this psychological affected not just by someone you don't know but by how a FANDOM (a completely made up identity) is treated isn't normal at all, being "physically unable" to unstan isn't normal at all 

My favourite celebrity is Beyonce and I can get into arguments if I disagree with takes about her music or ridiculous allegations rooted in bigotry, but I can also easily criticise and detach myself from her when she makes bad decisions, being her fan ultimately doesn't affect me more than being hyped and happy when she releases something and annoyed when people are OBJECTIVELY wrong about her, it never goes deeper, because I'm not attached to her as a person but as an artist, and because I don't see my enjoyment of her as being an extension of myself or my personality, so i don't feel the need to defend her FANDOM of all things 

I don't wanna be a dick cause as kpop fans we all fall onto these patterns the industry depends on it, but it's important to breathe and take a step back, when a fandom starts negatively affecting my mental health I delete twitter or at least unfollow most stan accs that participate in dramas, put not interested in most negative tweets popping up on my Tl, and abise the fuck out of the mute button, it's important to never let yourself be trapped into an echo chamber
