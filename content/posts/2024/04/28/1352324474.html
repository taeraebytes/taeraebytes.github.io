      <p>I think that he still shouldnâ€™t have replied to it. Now trolls/haters will see that and try to catch his attention (or the other members). Just a messy/unprofessional situation overall. Wakeone has to do something about that stupid app</p>

      <p>Oh yea that's possible whenever there's any kind of addressing hate comments just grow in numbers it's inevitable since the troll mindset is to get attention
