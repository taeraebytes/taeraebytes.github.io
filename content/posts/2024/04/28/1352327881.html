      <p>k so its not even because kzeroses dont like the song, thats why its charting on kakao because theyre listening to it, it's just that they literally dont want to stream on melon because of him ðŸ˜­ this is out of spite omfggg I was lurking on ktwt just now and we coulda easily been in melon top 100 just based on the amount of ppl listening on kakao where it doesnt matter. Melon top 100 is so important because thats where it reaches the k gp instead of the song staying within the fandom only ðŸ˜­</p>
