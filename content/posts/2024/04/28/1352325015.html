      <p>TW CORNY but During negative times like this I'm so grateful that the boys built a great team relationship and are mostly adults because they keep a strong facade publicly and always try to smile and laugh together: we've already said it but hao is strong as hell and I'm glad he's grown and comfortable enough to not have let all the disgusting homophobic and racist shit get to him at all, and I'm glad he and Hanbin are grown enough to not let their awful fanbases and shippers affect their relationship at all (they seem even closer lately) I'm glad Hanbin and Matthew are emotionally mature enough to support gunwook in his most sensible formative years and when he seems sensitive to criticisms, that they're all patient and affectionate with Ricky, that taerae has Matthew, that hao and yujin have gotten closer recently and yujin seems more comfortable with himself and most of all I'm thankful that Gyuvin is there for everyone!! Making everyone laugh while also being emotional enough to empathize with everyone, he's grown so much so quickly</p>
