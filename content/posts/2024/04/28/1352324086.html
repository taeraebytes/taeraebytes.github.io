      <p>it was deleted way before he replied but that certain user was spamming it so the mnet+ comments was full of “the comment has been blocked for violating community guidelines“ its not like he just randomly picked a single hate comment among thousands of comments it was getting spammed thats why he replied like that 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
