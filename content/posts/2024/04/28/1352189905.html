      <p>Something weird is happening in Hybe. I found it weird how both Zb1 and Riize were hit with controversies back to back and nothing happened to any Hybe groups (the male rookies). Like yeah Jiwoong cursed, but the way it got so much engagement was unheard of like you'd think he killed someone lmao. And no offense i still don't understand how tws song is charting that high. Internationally they didn't make any noise, and even koreans are questioning their charting. Apparently they're popular with kids so i'm waiting to see how their cb do, either they're really lucky or pledis is doing something fishy and Hybe is enabling it.</p>

      <p>CLOKC THAT TEA CLOCK THAT TEA WE WILL NEVER GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT TWS!!!!!! They basically did the same kind of marketing with them like they did with lesserafim v aespa and quite literally manipulated their charts. They always generate more negative traction for their rivals as well literally anyone that poses a threat to hybe becomes a victim

      <p>It's hilarious how intl kpop fans are like yeah you guys are eurocentric tws did really well in Korea but it's like an open secret amongst Korean kpop fans that tws streams were super fraudulent lol I could explain at length but their charting made absolutely no sense and everybody but their fans knew it</p>

      <p>The hybe kcharts payola is so easy to see btw, both tws and illit didn't have big kfandom but their charts rising so much during midnight a.k.a zombie hours in korea, only group that have big kfandom (ex:zb1) can do that, the payola is not giving them automatically top10 of course, but with a little push they absolutely can</p>
