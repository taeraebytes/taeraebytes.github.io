    "question": "Sharing this Reddit comment: I've seen quite a handful of K-zeroses desperately asking for people to stream, most seem to think that chart performance does not accurately reflect the size of the fandom in Korea and are quite disappointed with the fandom's attitude. I've even seen a comment talking about how it's very likely that the members all really liked Sweat as a song, more so than their title track, while WakeOne/management disagreed. The theory is that WakeOne has been using this pre-release as a sort of test to prove the members wrong; if it performs poorly, they can say, \"Here! See what happens when we listen to you you and let you do whatever you want to do! This is why you should shut up and listen to us!\"\n\nI'm not usually one to villainise WakeOne, because really at the end of the day, they are just a business trying to make as much profit from the boys as possible, not purposefully trying to sabotage them at every moment. However, I do think this theory has a bit of credibility given the current context. This pre-release saw very little promotion despite the boys being super enthusiastic about it, providing plenty of spoilers for it, Hao calling it a gift from the nine of them, both Hanbin and Ricky saying they prefer it over their upcoming title track, and also Hanbin's recent comment on Bubble about how the team can only grow more if the song is good and does well on the charts. I can't be sure but it seems to me like they're trying to hint at something.\n\nPerhaps I'm overreacting but I think this promotion period for Sweat has been so bittersweet. The boys are so lovely and talented, they've worked incredibly hard, the song is great and I truly believe it would have been enjoyed by the general public if they got a chance to listen to it in the first place. But for some reason, they've been rewarded with hoards of immature \"fans\" who do nothing but complain, send ridiculous protest trucks (since when did these become serious and not a joke???), threaten boycotts and cause subfandom fights nearly every day. Streaming the song on Melon is considered one of the most important responsibilities of 덕질 (fangirling? fanboying? being a fan?) but instead everyone is busy trying to swarm and photograph the members wherever they go. These boys are clearly so popular but so few seem to have the boys' best interests at heart. It's quite disheartening",
    "reply": "I guess in some way they could use it to prove that? But it's very obviois as to why the songs performing this way if this theory has truth to it then I'm sure they know how to market the group moving forward. I feel like kfan sentiment is pretty obvious so let's shelve jiwoong thanksssss"
