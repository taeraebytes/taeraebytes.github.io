      <p>this is something really small and random but one thing i hate about zb1â€™s tiktok is that they take forever to post the challenges they do with other idols. i noticed this the past 2 eras but i feel like itâ€™s gonna continue. like the other idolâ€™s group tiktok will post the challenge they do with a zb1 member asap (eg wooah and riize) but if u were a non-fan and were to click on zb1â€™s @ in the caption expecting to see ur bias in turn do zb1â€™s challenge then it wouldnâ€™t be there bc they just didnâ€™t post it at the same time ðŸ˜­ like i feel like itâ€™s just a miss of an opportunity. the purpose of these tiktoks is mostly to promote ur comeback to audiences who may not know the song otherwise and if the challenge with another fandomâ€™s idol isnâ€™t there then welp</p>
