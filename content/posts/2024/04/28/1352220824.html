seems like people are streaming the song but just not on melon for reasons we all can guess... w1 better pull their shit together for the title track. i dont care if they have to scrap the whole thing and rearrange the parts, mv productions and whatsoever. they shouldnt make the kfandom more mad than they are</p>

      <p>a lot of kfans are saying ppl are just being lazy or selfish rather than upset so who knows if rearranging changes things but whatever comes for the future I just hope it's better than this mi cyant take it
