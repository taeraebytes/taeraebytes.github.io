      <p>sweat fancam average views
1. hao
2. hanbin
3. matthew
4. yujin
5. gunwook
6. ricky
7. jiwoong
8. gyuvin
9. taerae

crazy how the bp rankings is pretty much the same and only yujin ricky taerae switched their rankings also i was kinda shocked that hanbin was barely cracking 10k in the 2nd fancam while hao was already at around 25k because their fans usually one up each other ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>are hb and zh views legit bc in the txt fandom everyone was gagged bc soobin and yeonjun had like 50k views in a day while the other members were barely cracking the 10k views and then it came out that yeonjun and soobin fans were buying views to compete ðŸ˜­</p>
