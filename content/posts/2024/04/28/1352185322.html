      <p>And telling them to showcase his main dancer position..there's no official position in zb1 and he gets tons of center moments this is just humiliating and I heard zh and shb fanbases also want to send trucks🤦‍♀️ if these 3 end up being super pushed in the tt (like they ALWAYS ARE) ill be super embarrassed, in what world would any artists WANT that you hzve to br actually so schizo to support trucks</p>
