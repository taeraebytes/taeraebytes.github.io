      <p>the only thing hb excels at over other dance line members is tutting. as an idol dancer, the others especially matthew and gunwook, yujin too on a good day, are on par with him. it‚Äôs like how xiaoting has the most dance experience in kep1er with her ballroom stuff but dayeon and hikaru overshadow her in their actual choreo because they are better idol dancers. anyway its so funny to watch allins throw tantrums over subjective rankings. they want him to stand out as the main dancer in a group full of main dancers. its just not gonna work sorry. anyways i prefer gunwook‚Äôs dance style over hanbins. he‚Äôs way more fun to watch in my opinion.</p>

      <p>I agree it's subjective there's a reason this is debated and it's preference I prefer to watch gunwook too he's a better performer but ppl will really pop veins over opinions... like u can say hanbins better bruh idncüò≠

      <p>A bit off topic but does anyone know gw's dance background? Like do we know anything besides he was on a school dance team + trained at jellyfish or is that basically it? He has what some would call ideal bg dance alignment but he also creates lines, fully completes moves, and uses dynamics in a way that makes me think he did jazz or fusion or something similar. I mean I think many people start off dancing in these genres (at least where I'm from, they're more accessible), and if you watch his feet during choreos, you'll notice they always rest between moves in third/fourth position rather than just askance which may partly be due to natural (or developed?) turnout + adjusting for his height, but i find it so interesting because he's really consistent with it.</p>

      <p>No all we know is he's been dancing for 4-5 ish years and he's done showcases, competitions(?) and jellyfish training. his friends that's on makemate is actually the reason he's started dancing but I'm not very verse in dance so I'm not rlly sure but this was interesting to hear. Is the resting thing supposed to happen or not

      <p>It's not a bad thing at all. It's just a detail I noticed bc there are other members who don't put much detail into footwork or foot placement outside of what's prescribed explicitely in the choreography. Like they will sometimes look like they are just standing there rather than posing/setting up the next move. You will even visibly see them switch from move to move without an intentional transition. The members with the smoothest transitions between moves are ones who use details from head to toe. Imo that's hanbin and gunwook consistently, and matt and hao pretty regularly. This lack of transition detail is actually what lessens yujin's dance for me overall. (Also I'm not talking about groove here, that's a whole different thing.)</p>
