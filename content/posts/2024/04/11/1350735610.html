iâ€˜ve been thinking this for a while and the socmed management is so ass it pissed me off so much, they didnt utilize rickyâ€™s engagement on tiktok, the dance challenges are so late (old school new school is like last summer) and basically every points she said in her twt. i know you dont like (?) yejigf but she does have a point here. it pains me looking at the engagement on tiktok because they clearly have potential but wk1 is shitty as hell, really hope the merge will give us more staff to concentrate on zb1</p>

      <p>damn sorry I didn't read all that but it's true the social media team is shit I feel like that's all they are rather than restrictive they don't know what to do. Ngl the members themselves also don't have the internet touch like they would make oldhead tiktoks too if they had control except for like 3 membersðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ yea they gotta hire someone new and young
