      <p>i feel like this upcoming cb can get them back on the map if they play their cards right iâ€™m already quite optimistic about the concept from the spoiler film and articles. just hope sweat and the title track is good. My biggest gripe about zb1 has always been their discography</p>

      <p>oh ur talking to someone who likes their discog I just think they've had bad timing (recent song trends) and rlly bad promo and quality production it's funny we were saying the exact same thing before crush came outðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I still had fun despite the push back it got and it's hard to fuck summer songs so I think we'll be alright

      <p>Men of the future did Yura Yura so I hope they stick with them. They've done a lot of chores for jyp groups, but I found them from their work with Pixy</p>

      <p>I think cuz it's a Japanese release the choreo was tailored less for constant promo I think it fit the song and it's fun to watch imo
