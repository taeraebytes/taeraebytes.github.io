      <p>It was a post with 300 views and no one gaf because it was the same shit that got debunked in April ðŸ’€ although they randomly spread it on Weibo today tho. I thought it was going to be smth new but itâ€™s some random pics of him and a girl in the same place and then one of them buried in the same next to eachother but they left out the context, it was pics from a class trip and they left out all the pics of the group of students / copped themðŸ’€</p>

      <p>this was not the same shit which got debunked in April .
that material was when he kept liking sexy random/ model women in biknis photos, but his fans buried it with another issue of him liking photos of girl groups to make it seems like he is just a fan of girl groups</p>
