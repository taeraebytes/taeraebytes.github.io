      <p>is twitter bigger than forums in south korea? i noticed that hao is constantly trending within top 10 when he sends bbl and zb1 automatically trends when theyâ€™re doing something too but for forums they only pop up from time to time except for like instiz. or maybe kzeroses are just mostly on stan twt?</p>

      <p>I think so? It's like how twitters bigger here too like forums are blog posts strictly it's harder to interact with content and I surf them sometimes the source is twitter half the timeðŸ˜­

      <p>Hao can't trend on instiz because his fans lock all of his community posts to outsiders</p>
