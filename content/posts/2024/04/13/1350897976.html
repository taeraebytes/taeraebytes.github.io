      <p>It's actually hard to get BTS tea because their kfans move in silence, but apparently namjoon was in a very long relationship with a very attractive Korean girl his fans were happy he even wanted to get married w her but they broke up I think last year or the year before and now he don't want kids anymore lmao it was a bad break up I guess</p>
