      <p>its funny how yuehua fans think that yuehua will treat the four like royalty once theyre back in yuehua ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ yall are making it really obvious that you guys are new to kpop/yuehua and their antics. yuehua is always nice at the beginning of their idols careers. why do they think yuehua wont find other "gems" to debut after two years of having the yuehuaz debut. there is a reason why companies like yuehua and wakeone are at the bottom.</p>
