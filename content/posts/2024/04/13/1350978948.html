      <p>Anon what are you talking about pann is the same account that blades the rinabin dating thing and his past dance videos 💀 they clearly will post anything about him that’s trending they even posted that rumour from the other day the only reason it wasn’t negative is because all the comments on the original article were dragging op and it was mass downvoted because no one believed it</p>
