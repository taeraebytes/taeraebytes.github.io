      <p>A+ list idol is or was in a process of heechulization lol.
He is always fanboying hard on the it girl of the moment, chasing a A list female idol at ISAC back in the days, going out with B+ list female idol a bit after, months ago he was seen with a more recent A list female idol at a concert (they even left together separated from the rest-a fansite of the female idol on twitter confirmed it was her with the male idol and a staff hanging out together, there's even pictures,  idk what kind of relationship they have but they're hanging out with eachother pretty often, while maybe flirting with another famous female idol around the same time 
He is in that famous GC, it's no wonder Heechul said recently that he likes hanging out with them group and even called one of them an alpha male LMAO they're all F boys</p>

      <p>There's also tea that another 97 liners friends with Jungkook also liked her at the same time and both were actively chasing her but eventually Jungkook got her. Their couple post still up but it sucks because when things were starting yuehua started to send her to china. They lasted quite a bit while she was there for good but then were in an on and off situation. His whole emo phase, long homeless hair, getting a bunch of tattoos in a short time and overall looking depressed was because of her, I don't know if they're together right now but c sasaengs been saying she's been vacationing in Korea when she gets to.

You guys missed it, they were so low key because everyone was focusing on him and other popular girl groups/ models while wjsn was mid.</p>
