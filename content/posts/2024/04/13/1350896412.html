      <p>Twitter is much more used than forums in Korea before it was more clean but now even the hate and trolling is more prelevent on twt because it's harder to get sued on there

For hao trending it's also because it's more of a safe space for him, due to his ethnicity any of his posts on kforums will get hated on a lot, although I've seen more homophobic and outing posts on twt when there's a fanwar</p>
