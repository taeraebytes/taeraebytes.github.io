      <p>well I'd be mad too if a fandom that has a track record of being sinophobic made jokes about another sinophobic freak stealing something that belongs to a chinese member. rosins are schizos but sometimes yall are too quick to brush them off as nothing even if they do have valid reasons to cause a scene</p>

      <p>Like I said in another cc you can't expect everyone to be up to date on an irrelevant artist and their moral history I didn't even know he said smth sinophobic until 2 days ago... like op said in their message they didn't know so why was there such intense backlash
