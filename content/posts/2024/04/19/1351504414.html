      <p>it's rlly not a simple yes or no even then there's schedule conflicts contract negotiations. they're considering hao but it's not like they've formally extended an invite and the show hasn't even actually launched so we'll see, but just saying don't be surprised if it doesn't happen it's rlly all possibility rn but yea a good opportunity
