    "question": "tbh hanbin never gonna look skinny skinny just because of his build, he got the elon musk build with a wide rib. Sorry I'm not even hating but it's the first thing that came to my mind because they both have short torso's so no matter what he's gonna look a bit bigger than the rest just because its his bone structure",
    "reply": "I think yea he has a bigger and shorter torso but that's easy to conceal with the right silhouette he has skinny legs and somewhat long arms so for that styling is his bestfriend I don't pay attention so idk if they got it down for him or not. But he doesn't have a bigger bone structure imo like gunwook has the obvious biggest bone structure but it just makes him look more muscular than he is I think for hanbin it's the fact that he was overweight in the past so he's held at a different expectation and he's holding himself to a harsh one as well. He looks super skinny to me usually but I see what u mean ab his torso when he wears higher waisted pants w a tighter fitted top it's awkward"

      <p>yeah i donâ€™t notice it as much when they are around eo but during that episode they all looked tiny next to that guy while wearing oversized clothes it was scary ðŸ˜­ now that i think about it the clothes were probably not even meant to be oversize they are just insanely skinny</p>

      <p>Ok Iâ€™m glad someone else pointed it out I noticed it on the live a couple days ago but i remember it being said in here how from in bloom to crush hanbin lost a lot of weight but damn in that live he looked like he lost even more. At least before he still has enough weight on his face to not make it noticeable but the last couple days Iâ€™ve noticed his face has lost so much weight too. Then gyuvins bubble messages about not eating too like none of these boys seems to have the healthiest relationship with food.</p>
