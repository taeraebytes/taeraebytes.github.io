      <p>Hao said that he could’ve done a better job than whoever was singing on that short sweat teaser audio. It’s fine he’s saying that tho right? He is the center of the group he can and should say stuff like that (I still have no idea who tf was singing in that teaser except ricky)</p>

      <p>So I checked to see if anon was saying the truth or not and basically around 3:45 they were talking whose voice was in the teaser and hao said “not me, I could have done better” also before this Ricky was appreciating the teaser and hao goes “oh because it’s your part” why he sounded so bitter

      <p>Tbh I think that's how the members joke in the dorm cause Ricky didn't seem uncomfortable at all and they all laughed, but if the roles were reversed people would've def jumped Ricky even though hao would've def found it funny</p>
