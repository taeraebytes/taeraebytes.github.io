      <p>Calling dibs on a bad attitude scandal. I mean he's already showing it by not high fiving seungchan and all those shady likes and though he's been called out for it it wasn't enough to end him, trust something bigger than jiwoong gonna drop.</p>

      <p>nah he was smart he got praise for all of that except for excessively getting crazy on weverse but it was small but if he does smth jiwoong level it would get triple the traction but sm would clean it up so good ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è truly they would need smth SHATTERING to get got and that would be too far imo cuz if even sm pr can't help then it's terrible and I wouldn't even wish that on them let's just keep checking out karma

      <p>ugh i feel like people should put themselves into sungchan shoes...

sungchan was a trainee for a long time, and when he was there he was super close with people like jungwoo, the wayv members, etc. then he finally made his debut on nct and he loved the members, be especially had a super close friendship with jungwoo like he was tweaking everytime he saw jungwoo and they even went to the same gym together, he loved that man and overall loved all the members. then he gets some nice opportunities like inkigayo mc and that skincare cf, but while he got that he was also without nothing else, like all he did was hanging out with nct, going to inkigayo and wait for his debut. but that debut never came and it was even worse when during nct 2021 he got nothing like he only had crumbs on those songs. then he gets pulled out of nct and thrown into riize. so now we have a situation on where he finally got his debut but all of his friends aside of shotaro are on nct... so the dude just probably wants to have success at least, and he knows how shitty is to be on a hiatus and not knowing if you are going to debut or not so he knows that he can't fuck up and doesn't want anyone else doing the same either. he is also probably annoyed that his schedules are crumbs while anton eunseok and wonbin are getting more schedules and getting pushed more by sm as the visual members when he was probably supposed to be getting that.</p>

      <p>His first mistake was having JUNGWOOü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ as a bff omg no wonder he's scary but I get it he comes off so passionate to me alongside wonbin like he rlly cried about debuting in riize despite like u said his friendships in nct. And I wa shocked to eunseok was named the visual of riize...??????? What kind of evil fucked up world is this no one even acknowledges his visual position compared to how sungchan was praised ngl if seunghan wasn't expose predebut I feel like they would've named him as one too but he's deserving! Yea no I get it for sungchan I would fuming as well but he's not thinking straigjt or he's just being crazy with the shade it's gonna backfire in some way üò≠ well let me just pray for his peace he's clearly disturbed AF but he has Anton now they're so cute and close he can stop being a demon now

      <p>Ok but if his bff is jungwoo he should learn from him bc Jungwoo might be shady but something about him is that this man is chill with every NCT member and he's always hyping them up. Sungchanie let's do the same with RIIZE members</p>
