      <p>Haechan's ex-girlfriend is dating a member of riize.
Eunseok got caught cheating with another woman while dating theonly, so they got into a fucking fight.
While I was dating eunseok and theonly, theonly took a lot of nude photos of eunseok. I was thinking about sharing them, but I didn't.
So, there are definitely 3 people in the riize Group who are dating right now. 


I just translated a tweet and filled it in but basically the gist of everything</p>
