      <p>Women always get it worse but I get the lsfm drag going on this long since it was like a 30? Minute set at Coachella even tho jimin was worse and supposed to be a good "singer" and veteran idol these girls will just get it worse also yea I keep seeing ppl target the Japanese members more like uhmmm okðŸ˜… and Sakura actually doing better then all of them lowkey she just beats chaewon and yunjin out cuz no one expects her to be good and she was aight
