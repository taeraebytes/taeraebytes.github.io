      <p>poor matthew you just canâ€™t beat like 20 cm height diff ðŸ˜­ esp since gunwook is just naturally stronger while being the same height as gyuvin</p>

      <p>I think it's possible to be shorter and stronger but Matthew didn't even really start bulking till like fall and gunwooks always been strong and athlete ur not beating thatðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and technically they'll always have more muscle mass their arms are literally bigger I wonder if gyuvin really bulked if he could hold his own in a fight against gunwookðŸ¤” I think jiwoong might be the only member who could beat him just cuz he's been a gym rat for years and he's not that short
