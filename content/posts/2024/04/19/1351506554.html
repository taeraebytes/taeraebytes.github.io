      <p>i get your point cause thats what i was thinking before. i always knew he was gay so it was weird for me to think of him like that and he had nothing few weeks ago. he seems to hit the gym alot more now. it looks like he is training to have muscles like gunwook or even matthew. the whole group probably knows by now that fans LOVE muscles (me included 🙋‍♀️). we are experiencing the sungchanism of hanbin 😂😂</p>
