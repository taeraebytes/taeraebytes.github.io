      <p>yeah i donâ€™t notice it as much when they are around eo but during that episode they all looked tiny next to that guy while wearing oversized clothes it was scary ðŸ˜­ now that i think about it the clothes were probably not even meant to be oversize they are just insanely skinny</p>

      <p>Ok Iâ€™m glad someone else pointed it out I noticed it on the live a couple days ago but i remember it being said in here how from in bloom to crush hanbin lost a lot of weight but damn in that live he looked like he lost even more. At least before he still has enough weight on his face to not make it noticeable but the last couple days Iâ€™ve noticed his face has lost so much weight too. Then gyuvins bubble messages about not eating too like none of these boys seems to have the healthiest relationship with food.</p>

      <p>I bet if someone told him he's actively stunting his ability to grow he'd stop but it's always so sad the members watch out for each other but they're all trynna be anorexic at the same time this is crazy
