      <p>like redebuting in a group without any members would probably only work for yujin and Matthew has one of the smaller kfandoms ik intl fame is a thing but will they carry a group of ppl they don't care ab I doubt it.. and he gave up his Canadian citizenship so ig he's intending on promoting in korea

But if he didn't bruh someone tell him CHOOSE CANADA CHOOSE CANADA not only will he go to the military but now international Artist visa fees for america are increased by 300%😭😭😭
