      <p>lmao this is what i thought bc he's basically 'mocking' them in his 'apology' and if they really did make him apologise on bubble then that'll just make the company even more mad since he doesn't look sincere (not saying that's bad thing tho bc personally idc).... idk what the point of him sending out that is tho, unless it's to further drill in that he's annoyed with wakeone and feels for the fans since all the members seem to be annoyed with them lately like hanbin was probably the member joining in the most after him with the shady comments yet he seems like the type who wouldn't do that given his leader role 😭</p>

      <p>Yea it was mocking idk maybe they just wanted to give the fans smth to laugh at but instead they're all angry I thought it was a little funny cuz if things were actually bad you would be able to tell
