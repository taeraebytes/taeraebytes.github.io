      <p>right iâ€™m actually an everglow stan and i laugh when zeroses and subfandoms complain about line distributions you guys havenâ€™t seen anything ðŸ˜­ and yet most forevers are ot6 and donâ€™t hate on mia (most hate for her came from outside the fandom) but i canâ€™t say the same for here</p>

      <p>Oh yea I heard that good on them I'd commit but yea I've seen not just in everglow but other groups how a lot of members don't get lines promo nadaaaa but I feel like the expectations always going to be wildly different w zb1. they're individual trainees that came from a survival show and they all won so it's expected that they should all have a good highlight run in their temporary careers
