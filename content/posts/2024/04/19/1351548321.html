      <p>i feel like haechan's bro just got some insane jealousy towards haechan that's stemmed from hate prob because hes known as the useless brother in the family knowing how some families run i wouldn't be surprised if he was always compared to haechan so thats why hes acting like this</p>

      <p>You know what's funny he's 18-19 like idk what happened haechan was whisked away from home as a child so he has to be truly evil to develop jealousy for his sibling that's been working for their family basically from birth ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and that could be it hes just a bum and he won't match up to his celeb bro there's another one born in 07 and he's normal
