      <p>gunwook was sick too why didn't they wait till everyone was all good🤦‍♀️ but it's ok that might just be him being over critical of himself they all still seem to like it overall regardless

      <p>They were probably on a time crunch to roll out the next cb since the last one was November and they had jp debut in between all of that. Tbh with how busy these boy’s schedules are it seems like all of them are getting sick every other day.</p>
