      <p>I have so many question about saesangs, like how do they feel about each other? Do they feel jealous if their bias noticed others but not them, exactly how many of them are flying on the plane as jebies, i have always noticed hanbin's fansite ( insert saesangs), and there are quite a lot of them, hao's must be even more than hanbin's; also the other members have saesangs; to me, it seems like almost 60–70% of the passengers of the plane contains jebies, their staff, and saesangs. </p>

      <p>lol we really had an in depth discussion and gossip sesh ab zb1 sasaeng a few months ago I'm not sure if they feel jealousy towards each other but they have a hierarchy and everything it's insane. and yea pretty much they all fly with them I'm assuming wakeone sells some of the flight info to the top fansites they're less sasaengy they don't much besides their fansite work I don't consider them sasaengs tbh and the richer you are the easier it is to travel with them
