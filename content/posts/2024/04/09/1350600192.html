      <p>zb1 is temporary group that treated like an old group. wakeone cannot keep the heat, no memorable content and the members are not entertaining enough. after japan fancon i thought they will comeback strong but turn out they'e going downhill rn</p>

      <p>wdym members are not entertaining enough ðŸ˜­ i was more of a solo stan just bc of the lack if the ot9 content and didnâ€™t care enough for individual updates from my non biases but recent content made me like the group again bc they are just so fun ðŸ˜­  i watched the whole 30+ min video in one breath and they were so entertaining</p>

      <p>they are boring. that's why they couldn't handle dorm or zerobaseone go kind of show, only relied on scripted one. i thought they will be super interesting group like wanna one suju or shinee, but they're not.</p>
