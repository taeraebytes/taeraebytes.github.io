      <p>Dude just got a wake up call. Gyuvin told him there's a problem and after listening he chose to fix it instead if ignoring it I don't see how that's being fake. That's him trying to improve himself like what ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>he did his duty, as an idol. wait until he feels bored. i don't think he will be consistent but given a history that he love to write diary, maybe he will use bubble as his diary book. i dunno</p>
