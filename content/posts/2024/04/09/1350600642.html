      <p>he sent his dog’s photo baobao and bbo contexted it as fubao the panda. this made rosins angry cos he sent like 3? photos way earlier in the day and the name baobao even trended like #5 on ktwt. and he sent another photo again at night awhile ago with the msg baobao. He’s also mentioned those names like multiple times before. and given bbo’s track record w him + them insisting on being ot9, not knowing who baobao is probably triggered the trauma again. Also bubblebaseone is just dumb like the man sent like 5 dog photos consecutively before that baobao name drop and you think he’s talking about a panda???</p>

      <p>Ok so their only crime is being dumb they corrected it quickly so idgi😭😭😭😭😭😭 this isn't rage worthy tbh. And the track record is the Starbucks issue which is a political and genocidal topic i feel like there needs to be an understanding on the admins part like im sure that these admins are teens or young adults who weren't sure how to go about it and weren't trying to get hao dragged. It would look like they were shielding or were insensitive and they released a statement(I think) like ppl make mistakes and I think it was a fan gift? Idk topics like this are always met with outrage for ppl to act like it came out of nowhere or out of a place of rage for hao makes no sense to me

      <p>diff anon here i think some ppl are just paranoid because of what happened but they shouldn’t be spamming the qrts after the baobao misinfo was corrected because it’s not going to change anything since it’s already been corrected. altho i also think bubblebaseone should’ve apologized for the mistake. 

i get where they’re coming from tbh, it was so disappointing during that starbucks issue bubblebaseone did not even clarify below the tweet that it was a fangift, because the non-fans who found the tweet and started sending him dts all thought he bought the drink and was endorsing it, instead of just showing appreciation to a fangift. the admins left the tweet up under the guise of “educating” him but they did not clarify the situation, nor did they put any links on how to support palestine beneath the tweet. all it brought him was harrassment and dts from non-fans who didn’t even have his bubble so they could ACTUALLY educate him, the only ppl who educated him are rosins/zeroses who have his bubble, the same ppl who were begging bubblebaseone to take it down. obviously rosins were gonna be mad like they’re the ones educating him but also have to see him be subjected to dts from people who didn’t even know him because bubblebaseone was being stubborn and stupid. also the whole thing felt very performative because a few days before another member had posted a photo WITH a starbucks in his hand and most zeroses did not care, yet people were sending dts to hao just because he mentioned starbucks. and bubblebaseone left the tweet up for 14hrs, during that time countless rosins dmed them to explain how that tweet was bringing him more harm than good but instead of admitting their mistake bubblebaseone just blocked those rosins. it’s hard to believe they care about hao when they did absolutely nothing for 14 hrs even after seeing ppl sending hao dts in the qrts. and rather than blocking the ones sending him dts in the qrts they’d rather block rosins who tried to talk civil with them?? something is not adding up</p>
