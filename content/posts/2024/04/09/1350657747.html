      <p>I'm trying to catch up on your ccs (found your account recently, it's gonna take me at least a month to do so but I'm nosy so whateves) but I've noticed a running theme from what I've seen and it's that Gunwook poses a problem for a lot of rosins and allindans because his existence in the group means you can't call those members the most talented in all fields (rapping, singing, and dancing). People naturally want to call their favorites the most talented and praise them constantly (which is, understandable) but Gunwook having a high baseline in everything and being able to execute everything means he's the most comprehensively talented, and I think this is where a lot of hatred comes from from those fandoms: people are, bluntly, jealous he can do things their bias can't do. If you think Hanbin and Hao can outrap him you are delusional. With vocals, Hao is better than both Hanbin and Gunwook but you could argue Gunwook is better than Hanbin when he stays in his range. With dancing Hao is not as good as either of them but between Gunwook and Hanbin you could argue who's the better performer (keep in mind this is not only regarding to waacking, waacking  is just a dance style, dancing is not only waacking). Some people love Hanbin's ultra upright posture ingrained from his voguing and waacking days, and some people don't like it. But I can't really think of anything particularly divisive when it comes to Gunwook's dancing skills because he can dance with immense power but he also doesn't lack fluidity or the ability to dance feminine styles (watch any of his NKOTB fancams or his actual attempts at girl group covers). Just wanted to share that observation.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm going to say this in the nicest way possible; gunwook poses little threat to hanbin or even hao, and he is not a better singer than hanbin.</p>

      <p>they're the same level technical wise and then it's just preference of tone after that I and a lot of ppl prefer gunwook cuz he has a prettier tone it's subjective no? Also I'm not here to argue I just don't care
