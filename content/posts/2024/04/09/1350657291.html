      <p>I'm trying to catch up on your ccs (found your account recently, it's gonna take me at least a month to do so but I'm nosy so whateves) but I've noticed a running theme from what I've seen and it's that Gunwook poses a problem for a lot of rosins and allindans because his existence in the group means you can't call those members the most talented in all fields (rapping, singing, and dancing). People naturally want to call their favorites the most talented and praise them constantly (which is, understandable) but Gunwook having a high baseline in everything and being able to execute everything means he's the most comprehensively talented, and I think this is where a lot of hatred comes from from those fandoms: people are, bluntly, jealous he can do things their bias can't do. If you think Hanbin and Hao can outrap him you are delusional. With vocals, Hao is better than both Hanbin and Gunwook but you could argue Gunwook is better than Hanbin when he stays in his range. With dancing Hao is not as good as either of them but between Gunwook and Hanbin you could argue who's the better performer (keep in mind this is not only regarding to waacking, waacking  is just a dance style, dancing is not only waacking). Some people love Hanbin's ultra upright posture ingrained from his voguing and waacking days, and some people don't like it. But I can't really think of anything particularly divisive when it comes to Gunwook's dancing skills because he can dance with immense power but he also doesn't lack fluidity or the ability to dance feminine styles (watch any of his NKOTB fancams or his actual attempts at girl group covers). Just wanted to share that observation.</p>

      <p>I wouldn’t say more talented tho, I’d say he is more an all rounder that the rest of the group amd that is irrefutable. But I’d think more talented is kinda a stretch? Because talent is a variety of manyyy things</p>

      <p>Ig yea that's true well rounded doesn't always mean most talented but I feel like when u consider he's rlly good at all of them not just average I think you can say most talented. He also writes and composes and excels at performance so I feel like that adds to it so imo he's the most talented in the group
