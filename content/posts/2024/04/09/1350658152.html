    "question": "Just for input he also lost that weight in his teens, I lost 25kg from 17-19 and i didn’t have any excess skin and I was told by dietitians and doctors that’s is less likely for people to develop loose skin a. The younger they loose the weight because their skin still has a lot of collagen and holds elasticity in it and B. If they diet the healthy way. Judging by his predebut pics he lost the weight over a couple years and a big part of that was probably his dancing too so he might have stretchy skin? But not saggy skin. Plus he’s worn tank tops a lot before and the common place people would get excess skin removed is from their biceps but it always leaves a visible scar and he doesn’t have one.",
    "reply": "Yea that makes sense he's young and 30ish kg isn't that much for loose skin I feel like?"
