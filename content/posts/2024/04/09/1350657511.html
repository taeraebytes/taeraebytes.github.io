      <p>I'm trying to catch up on your ccs (found your account recently, it's gonna take me at least a month to do so but I'm nosy so whateves) but I've noticed a running theme from what I've seen and it's that Gunwook poses a problem for a lot of rosins and allindans because his existence in the group means you can't call those members the most talented in all fields (rapping, singing, and dancing). People naturally want to call their favorites the most talented and praise them constantly (which is, understandable) but Gunwook having a high baseline in everything and being able to execute everything means he's the most comprehensively talented, and I think this is where a lot of hatred comes from from those fandoms: people are, bluntly, jealous he can do things their bias can't do. If you think Hanbin and Hao can outrap him you are delusional. With vocals, Hao is better than both Hanbin and Gunwook but you could argue Gunwook is better than Hanbin when he stays in his range. With dancing Hao is not as good as either of them but between Gunwook and Hanbin you could argue who's the better performer (keep in mind this is not only regarding to waacking, waacking  is just a dance style, dancing is not only waacking). Some people love Hanbin's ultra upright posture ingrained from his voguing and waacking days, and some people don't like it. But I can't really think of anything particularly divisive when it comes to Gunwook's dancing skills because he can dance with immense power but he also doesn't lack fluidity or the ability to dance feminine styles (watch any of his NKOTB fancams or his actual attempts at girl group covers). Just wanted to share that observation.</p>

      <p>Allindans do have jealousy because Hanbin isn't widely acknowledged for his dancing. Yeah he's good at tutting & wacking, but he can rarely acknowledge that and he's not the only main dancer with a professional background. They have a problem with the entire vocal line. Gunwook because he unofficially has the same position and Haorae because they are acknowledged as main vocals, where Hanbin isn't (and shouldn't). 

As a rosin-leaning person who occasionally looks into rosin akgaes & solos, I haven't seen any jealousy over claiming more/better positions. Hao's pretty well acknowledged for his vocals and his stage presence. The only thing I see complaints about with regards to positions (besides center, which isnt relevant here) is he isn't given any high notes or vocally interesting parts per his main vocal position, which has nothing to do with Gunwook.

Not sure why anyone would be jealous of Gunwook's rapping ability. ZB1 isn't a rap group and most people don't want rap anyways (sorry requeef). For Allindans maybe it's another thing to add, but for rosins it doesn't make much sense and arguing for any sort of rap position wouldn't be beneficial at all. In fact, rosins would prob hate it bc he's been given rap instead or vocal lines in a couple covers.</p>

      <p>I mean they're basing this completely off of my cc and I can agree that I see it in both parties even more so in the ones I leave unanswered, Twitter is a whole nother realm. Rap is undervalued and underused in kpop these days and especially zb1 yea but I think it's a great skill and ppl just rlly use it to separate gunwook from the rest of the group and give him the ace title lol

      <p>Anon this is an stretch bc i see tweet with thousands of interactions every day talking about Hanbin dancing and tbh if you ask people which one is the main dancer of zb1 I feel like most people will say that it's Hanbin?</p>
