People naturally want to call their favorites the most talented and praise them constantly (which is, understandable) but Gunwook having a high baseline in everything and being able to execute everything means he's the most comprehensively talented, and I think this is where a lot of hatred comes from from those fandoms: people are, bluntly, jealous he can do things their bias can't do.

Some people love Hanbin's ultra upright posture ingrained from his voguing and waacking days, and some people don't like it.

Just wanted to share that observation.",
