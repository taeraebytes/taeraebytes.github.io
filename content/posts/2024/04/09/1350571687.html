      <p>I wonder if gyuvin showed him the essays his kfans wrote, like from the big accs because they were really nice about it. They were like we don't care if its big or small, u don't have to wait until something big comes up just simple day to day stuff is enough because its coming from u or something. imo i feel like he did see those cuz hes been spamming the smallest things which icl is nice to see</p>
