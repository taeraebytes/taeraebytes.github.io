      <p>There's a reason why everyone was saying to not be scared of them going to china like even those solos who has the yellow ones actually lights up their lightring since they only planned to use the yellow ones whenever Hao mcs and that's why they all bought the light ring ðŸ˜­

Even solos supports the group pls</p>
