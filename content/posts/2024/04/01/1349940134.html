    "question": "What do u think about hao’s “try to be an idol” reply? Bbosongee posted it and ppl don’t like it. Some are saying he should’ve said something like “u r doing great, I’m proud of u” and send them support, the others are saying at least idol’s work is always rewarded and they get paid millions while ppl with normal jobs. The hao scandal prediction seems more real now. He may say something really controversial that will cause a lot of outrage",
    "reply": "I'm ngl... if I was getting beat by school and a celebrity told me try being an idol I would lose it😭😭 I get he's doing both but you couldn't spare a \"you got this\"? but it's whatever it ain't me that got the reply I just know op is sickkkkk tho"
