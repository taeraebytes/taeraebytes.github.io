      <p>Sister not with that orange hair. I'm sorry requeefiem I love you but Ricky looks Ursula from Little mermaid with that orange hair and long chin. Frankly speaking he needs to put some weight.</p>

      <p>Before the Jiwoong scandal Jiwoong and Yujin were the universally agreed upon visuals in kforums, Ricky and Gyuvin were sometimes put in there without much backlash, haobin were occasionally out in there but would get backlash as they have a lot of haters in those sites

Thus wether you like them or not Jiwoong Yujin Ricky and Gyuvin are the most uncontroversial visuals</p>

      <p>I'm not sure whether you aware about infamous pann setup troll post about "if yujin was in riize he would be main visual" he kinda ratio wonbin with 443 up vote and 300 down vote but oh boi riize stan butchered yujin and called him ultimate dozen but then some of them argued anton is dozen too. yujin well known for visual but he dont have good reputation when it comes to skill.</p>
