      <p>This is just a theory but today so many pics of Ricky got posted and that just kinda proves most of his fanbase are casualsðŸ¤¥I think this is also the reason why most of his dedicated fansites r sasaengs cuz if thereâ€™s barely any content (apart from TikTokâ€™s and a few anecdotes about him from Gyuvin) about him - the only dedicated fans he would be able to attract w such bare bones info is sasaengsâ€¦ who r probably attracted to that mysteriousness and (maybe?) like thst they have to stalk for that info themswlves, or at least they have the ability to</p>

      <p>Like a lot of his pics got posted and not a lot of ppl saw it? But yea Ricky doesn't have a big strong fandom and the his activeness does play into it and actually a lot of his big sasaengs dropped him so it's just the fansites that travel everywhere and break a few rules that are left they're like bottom tier sasaengs I like him so it's kind of sad to see but also it's rlly up to him and how he wants to interact and present himself I hope he becomes more active it's not even ab authenticity it's more just like feeding ppl to me at least but his rukidans are getting upset so he might start tapping in

I think he just needs to find balance with social media, idk anything bout him asides from wat I read here but seems like he has boundaries or w.e and crazy sasaengs so I can see him viewing social media or bubble as feeding the sasaengs which sucks for real fans.</p>
