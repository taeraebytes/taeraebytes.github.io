      <p>There's sooo much zerocolas I think it's harder to  understand the size of their fanbase considering cp fans dont care much about numbers and sales but I believe ATP that it's the second biggest fan base in China, Yujin fandom is a lot quieter his super topic is a lot more dead too, Ricky is def the rising star</p>
