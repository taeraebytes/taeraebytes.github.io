      <p>most to least stupid imo:
1. jiwoong (not his fault but he went to a bad high school or something along those lines. if i remember correctly hus old company screwed him over.)
2. gyuvin (he himself admitted that he wasn’t a good student and his former teacher said it too. i agree that he’s very emotionally intelligent tho.)
3. yujin (this kid does not go to school)
4. ricky (rumors that his grades were bad in school. can anyone confirm if he graduated high school genuine question.)
5. taerae and matthew (both were smart enough to go to college right? someone fact check me.)
7. hanbin (seems both academically and emotionally intelligent. we know that he’s in college while working at the same time. did he graduate yet? someone fact check me again.)
8. gunwook (we all know he’s super smart and was very involved in high school. probably would’ve went to a sky university if he didn’t take the idol path.)
9. hao (got into the best geosciences university in china and 17th best in the entire world. enough said.)
what do y’all think?</p>

      <p>yea Ricky's grades were like 1.5 gpa and no he didn't graduate he was supposed to go to school in korea but he didn't but I think he's just smarter than gyuvin. Matthew was a health science major albeit he attended uni for one semester but I think I would tie him and hanbin and idk for taerae like at all and then yea
