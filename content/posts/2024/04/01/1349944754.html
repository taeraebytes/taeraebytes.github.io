      <p>Hanbin is the most well trained and cunning (good way) when it comes to giving answer he ain't stupid he knows what to talk. Gunwook ain't stupid but his honesty can stir some controversy. Yujin being slow help him in dodging many situations.
Zhang Hao is not very bright frankly speaking again he is honest like gunwook so yeah.</p>

      <p>he is the most "media trained" he's very serious ab his image but if anon is also considering just straight intelligence it's still going to be gunhao but not u said this ab hao and look at what we woke up toðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but hanbin co-signing he's not the brightest either
