I think when you are kpop idol if you have any controversy best thing is to apologize and move on because this people are literally digging his past ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>matthew is not dumb what ðŸ˜­ he was literally studying biology in a pretty good university in canada. ricky should be higher sorry we all know he wasnâ€™t that good at school and there IS enough evidence for taerae yâ€™all just donâ€™t pay attention to him ðŸ˜­ heâ€™s not like the smartest but heâ€™s a pretty logical thinker 

i think it should go (from dumbest to smartest)

gyuvin
jiwoong 
ricky
yujin
matthew
taerae
hanbin 
gunwook
hao</p>

      <p>I think being bookish education is diffrent thing and being smart is different thing. Hao is bookish smart but not street smart same goes to gunwook. Hanbin is street smart.</p>

      <p>Hmm I disagree, both hao and gunwook are smart, especially hao like we all saw him in boys planet. Are you saying this basing on his comment today? ðŸ˜­ that's just how he usually interacts but to non fans, they dont know him so they will criticize. Gunwook's a bit naive yes....and hanbin is just overly self conscious and he calculates what he wanna say (which is not a bad thing at all btw considering this industry)</p>
