      <p>You could not convince me for all the money in the world they are only friends. I’m not saying they are dating or have a situationship or anything like that but there is a hundred percent some feelings there and the difference in the most simple interactions with other members vs eachother makes it too obvious.</p>

      <p>Y’all always have a problem with them there’s no content it’s bad there’s content it’s bad god forbid they even take a selfie it’s gonna be called distasteful fanservice and if it was any other pairing y’all would be gagging over the kcon vid idc if y’all think they’re real or not but it’s just so annoying seeing ppl constantly shit on everything they do</p>
