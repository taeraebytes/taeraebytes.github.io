      <p>Yujin is the top male visual of 5th gen. Literally everyone, the fans and non-fans praise his looks on k-side. There was a popular post titled the faces I want to marry and there were pics of pretty female idols and yujin. He was the only guy among them and everyone agreed that he’s so beautiful that he can even compete with the female visuals. Also he’s not the visual dozen ppl paint him to be, the boy can sing and dance, with proper training he’ll go far in his career.</p>
