      <p>What do u think about hao’s “try to be an idol” reply? Bbosongee posted it and ppl don’t like it. Some are saying he should’ve said something like “u r doing great, I’m proud of u” and send them support, the others are saying at least idol’s work is always rewarded and they get paid millions while ppl with normal jobs. The hao scandal prediction seems more real now. He may say something really controversial that will cause a lot of outrage</p>
