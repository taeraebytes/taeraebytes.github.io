      <p>its so over omg i think he knows bcs he apologized on bbl... is wk1 going to put him on socmed ban or make him hide his direct personality from now on FUCKKKKKKðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

also wasnt there a tarot anon here a while ago who predicted haorae are going to get into scandals in the beginning of april... well idk if this counts as a scandal but the tweet posted by bbosongee dragging him is blowing up. some non-fans are dragging him but there's also people defending him that it's obviously a joke and "that fan shouldnt have said they're having a hard time to an idol in the first place, ur idol is not ur psychiatrist" lmaoðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
