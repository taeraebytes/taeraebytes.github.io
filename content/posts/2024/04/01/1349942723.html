      <p>what r ur thoughts on the amount of hate jiwoong is getting from knets ðŸ˜­ and do i-zeroses even know this is happeningasdfghjkl.., but honestly im just surprised its not rlly affecting the whole group as much as i thought it would, acc maybe the opposite because everyone's having fun trolling him but leaving the others alone. like ddakjungarchive tries to crop the members out of their posts</p>

      <p>lowkey I feel bad but I saw it coming the moves wakeone and jiwoong made are just a result of this even if it was just company statements and jiwoong stayed silent it wouldn't be this badðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but it's just taking an extreme joke path now and it's left the members unaffected so idrc
