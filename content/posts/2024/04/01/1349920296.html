      <p>i found the kcon content so fun but the only thing that killed the vibe for me a bit were some of the signs like 😭 i saw no one bring this up but maybe i just don't use twitter enough anymore but one of the ones i saw for a split second said "yujin shoot me" in english and lowkey it gave me the vibes of those weird signs exols used to do back in the day but a lot more tame. then quite a number of the haobin ones had ppo ppo on it and i get ppo ppo specifically is just a peck and can be platonic but idk.... maybe it's not that deep but it was bordering on ship content like don't make it so obvious and then someone had a sign that said NEULBIN and hao gave it a thumbs up like ok he seemed chill but like seriously don't bring rps names to an official event are u crazy</p>
