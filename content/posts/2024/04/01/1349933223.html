      <p>There's a reason why everyone was saying to not be scared of them going to china like even those solos who has the yellow ones actually lights up their lightring since they only planned to use the yellow ones whenever Hao mcs and that's why they all bought the light ring 😭

Even solos supports the group pls</p>

this person pisses me off their tweet is claiming ppl made bad faces at jiwoong and when asked why their reason is because he got less cheers at kcon ? it’s 2 completely diff things💀 and personally i felt like his cheers were rly good because his popularity is nugu there in comparison</p>
