wow no one can convince me shbg isn't made up of akgaes who hate zh lol the hashtags are for haobin but the photo they used makes it look like hanbin is the only one mcing with that tiny haobin photo in the corner...😀 while zhg kept it professional and used a proper duo photo for the haobin mc tags

not to mention shbg is trending a solo phrase for mc hanbin only (kcon with mc shb) while zhg's solo phrase isn't mc related (heart stealer zh)... 
full shade but if they're going to run a fanbase they should keep it classy like zhg</p>

      <p>reminded me of that time when shb global and kjw global apologized for their previous admins causing problems in the global admins discord group and calling zh names😭 kjw apologized and ensured everyone that their admins are all ot9 and they will always respect all members while shb global posted a half-ass apology and proceeded to promote their solo projects in the same apology post lmfao. not even a single mention of their team respecting or supporting all  nine members. shb global obviously have solos/akgaes in their team idk why some of yall still think their fanbase is ran by ot9s lol</p>
