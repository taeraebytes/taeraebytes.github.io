      <p>Say thank you kingbin imagine how much zb1 would've tanked if he debuted when he was messy as hell on twitter and discord. Hanbin is a fucking king bc even his ass knew that Jay shouldn't debut with him.</p>

      <p>amber heard a lying scheming psycho tho I watched the entire trial, even her lawyers were sighing at her lies and how she couldnt keep her story straight and wouldn't stfu while on stand opening gateways for johnnys legal team to tap in and discredit old domestic abuse rumors. Like if she stfu they would've never brought kate moss in to debunk johnny pushing her down the stairs.</p>
