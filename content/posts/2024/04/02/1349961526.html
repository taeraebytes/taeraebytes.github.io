i came across shbchart's tweet ab that sales ranking and got confused because i'm planning to buy from colorgram and last i remembered zb1's sales start on april 1st which is 2 days from now, so i looked at the qrts and sure enough there's ppl calling them outðŸ˜­ damn this is so embarrassing why is shbcharts claiming these sales have anything to do with hanbin</p>

      <p>he's endorsing an existing line so if they are using it to compare sales with other members it's not correct but if they are doing it to show his sales while the product wasn't in the top before, i don't find anything wrong with it lol.</p>

      <p>Wait Iâ€™ve got screenshots from the days the 4 members pictures dropped and it wasnâ€™t the best seller and after his pic was added it gained that little hot right now sign on olive young. Plus Iâ€™ve seen lots of my moots at people on the tl buy it already because lip glosses are usually a safe option for most people.</p>

      <p>well those people are obviously lying ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ no proof of shot but yall chose to believe them? its normal that lip products how anon mentioned are above other products like blush or even eyeshadows. people are still buying the product with hanbins face on the website. the only difference is that after april 1st you could get a photocard with your item. the people who are buying it now are either buying it cause the item is good or cause they want to support hanbin way before april 1st.</p>

      <p>The tintory line (new line) has additional lucky draw polaroid gift along with the product which is why even Gyuvinâ€™s sales were higher than other members like Yujin lol</p>
