      <p>Jiwoong really pisses me off so much you can tell he dgaf about this group 😭 Idc how many times he will try to pull the oldest hyung card it’s so obvious when he’s asked about other members he just says a random name (saying hanbin is the loneliest member 😭 or saying hao is the most romantic one which was funny af since hanbin basically said the opposite 😭) For every single member you could at least name one other member that they’re close with but for jiwoong? Not a single one lmao i used to think it’s Matthew but it looks like they fell out or something. He doesn’t bring anything into the group he always tries to do some bad gaybait instead of interacting with the members normally like none of us asked for this. He seriously needs to lock in or something because he genuinely ruins content for me sometimes 😭</p>
