      <p>I still for the life of me cant understand why he did that. idols rarely respond to hate like that and when they do its usually during like a live stream and they just make a slight psa to be nice. But to fully write a comment reply to hate is weird and attention seeking</p>

      <p>I was kind of surprised too I've never seen a direct reply to a death threat before and it was during the worst time ever the air was so weird that era

      <p>And after that hao's entire comment section on mnet plus got FLOODED with racist homophobic and death threats comments for days even though whoever commented under hanbin's post had nothing on their profile that indicates them being a hao fan like ughhhhh dark times you put us in hanbin I will never forget 🤦‍♀️</p>

      <p>Well I mean the thing is that Hao also doesn't want to stand up for himself, he knows about the comments yet he prefers to ignore them and that's fine too</p>

      <p>but this isn't a matter of standing up for urself do u think every celebrity in history that's been faced with death threats just didn't wanna stand up for themselves or was too cowardly..?
