    "question": "this is extremely random but i always see fans talking about wanting their idols to go into acting (weirdly enough i personally don't get that bc they always frame it so boring like most of these ppl only want that so they can see their fav male idol kiss a woman and then self insert as the woman. also idk i'm into idols bc they're idols, don't really care for tv like that, not bc i want them to be actors tho i know ppl are different) and i feel like this conversation is increased with survival show groups bc of how lots of them went to acting BUT despite everything i've just said, u can disregard it in ur pov, lmao would u ever wanna see gunwook acting? do u see that for him or is that something he's ever expressed? what genres?",
    "reply": "No same I don't care for actors and I find trying to be involved boring and ngl I never cared for it but my friend always talked ab him acting in thrillers or action and she got to me it's not smrh I actively want but I'd like it. He's pretty good at it and always references korean media he likes like I wouldn't wanna see him in a typical romance drama but maybe a thriller action drama horror smth like that. And I don't think he's ever expressed it he seems set on being an idol for now"
