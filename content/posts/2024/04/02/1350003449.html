      <p>since we're not going to be fed a dorm reality here are my thoughts on what i think the dynamics are like:
jiwoong: wbk he doesnt live w them, occasionally pops his head in and loiters around, does some stupid shit and everyone lowkey side eyes him but sorta plays along, harasses yujin
hanbin: i think he would maintain the leader persona, tells the members to clean their rooms, i imagine hes the type to gather them all in the same spot in the morning or smth to list their tasks or schedules for the day, overall just tries to give all the members a little bit of attention
hao: hangs out w whoever he's currently close w (currently gyuvin) and probably gives yujin slack for not studying or smth lol, nonchalant w the members but not the most talkative either unless they approach him first. probably randomly breaks out into random gg choreo
matthew: wbk that he cooks for them even if its kinda shit, hangs around w hanbin and gunwook, will occasionally do smth spontanious (like that gingerbread house thing) and spend a week just cooped up on that project
taerae: goes out every hour to make out with myung jaehyun, probably still does the stupid mother pose around the house and belts in the middle of the night but its all in good fun, would get annoyed along w hanbin when chores and responsibilities arent filled
ricky: kind of a shut in, rarely seen out of his room, carries around his ipad everywhere, doesnt hang out, kinda messy, doesnt get rlly involved or hang out w the members unless they invite/include him, probably not very good at chores
gyuvin: randomly plops down in any members room when hes bored to play w them, friends w everyone naturally, the most social and involved w everyone elses lives, always suggesting they go out
gunwook: he keeps some sort of order in the house along hanbin, does his and others chores beforehand, hangs out w gyuvin the most but also probably chills w yujin and maybe at times encourages him to do his school work
yujin: gets babied by everyone and seems introverted but is acc one of the members who hangs out w the others the most, barely attends school and its kinda in the back of his mind but also not, just a regular kid idk</p>

I can see that with hanbin yea he probably spends a lot of time on the other floor to keep it orderly 

yes yes I'm nodding he also kicks it with gunwook a lot since they sleep tgthr

aw matthews cute hes probably watching some anime or building more gundam

Excuse me? nfnenmfmdmmf and probablt yea lol

I think he can kick it with some of them if he's not in his room but seeing as how only like two ppl talk ab him at the dorm he probably chills in his own space the most but I think like I said hanbin is leaderly so he probably makes them do activities tgthr a few times a month like a movie or dinner in the dorm 

yes for gyuvin

yes for gunwook he def spends a good amt of time in gyurickys room for gyuvin and it's where he chills with Ricky time to time

yea regular cute kid he seems like he rlly likes hanging out with his favorite members
