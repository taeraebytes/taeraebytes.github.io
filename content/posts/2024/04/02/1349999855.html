      <p>most to least stupid imo:
1. jiwoong (not his fault but he went to a bad high school or something along those lines. if i remember correctly hus old company screwed him over.)
2. gyuvin (he himself admitted that he wasn‚Äôt a good student and his former teacher said it too. i agree that he‚Äôs very emotionally intelligent tho.)
3. yujin (this kid does not go to school)
4. ricky (rumors that his grades were bad in school. can anyone confirm if he graduated high school genuine question.)
5. taerae and matthew (both were smart enough to go to college right? someone fact check me.)
7. hanbin (seems both academically and emotionally intelligent. we know that he‚Äôs in college while working at the same time. did he graduate yet? someone fact check me again.)
8. gunwook (we all know he‚Äôs super smart and was very involved in high school. probably would‚Äôve went to a sky university if he didn‚Äôt take the idol path.)
9. hao (got into the best geosciences university in china and 17th best in the entire world. enough said.)
what do y‚Äôall think?</p>

      <p>yea Ricky's grades were like 1.5 gpa and no he didn't graduate he was supposed to go to school in korea but he didn't but I think he's just smarter than gyuvin. Matthew was a health science major albeit he attended uni for one semester but I think I would tie him and hanbin and idk for taerae like at all and then yea

      <p>theres contrasting talk that ricky was either rlly smart or rlly bad at school? honestly the latter sounds more believable but i think in the past he has said hes quite good at math which yeah i guess suits him</p>

      <p>he just seems like the type to not do homework but his friend told me that he would ask her for help a lot so ig it was just adjusting to being an intl student plus he probably only cared ab art but idk which scjool he got the bad gpa at but people said he was in tennis at crean and he was at risk so idküò≠
