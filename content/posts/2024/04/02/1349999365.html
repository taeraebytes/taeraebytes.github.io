      <p>I still for the life of me cant understand why he did that. idols rarely respond to hate like that and when they do its usually during like a live stream and they just make a slight psa to be nice. But to fully write a comment reply to hate is weird and attention seeking</p>

      <p>I was kind of surprised too I've never seen a direct reply to a death threat before and it was during the worst time ever the air was so weird that era

      <p>Well I mean the thing is that Hao also doesn't want to stand up for himself, he knows about the comments yet he prefers to ignore them and that's fine too</p>

      <p>but this isn't a matter of standing up for urself do u think every celebrity in history that's been faced with death threats just didn't wanna stand up for themselves or was too cowardly..?
