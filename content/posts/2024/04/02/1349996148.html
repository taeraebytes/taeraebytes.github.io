      <p>i think zb1 is criticized more harshly than riize too, and i also think that jiwoong scandal is part of the reason why knetz r so harsh on them lol in today’s hao scandal on pann a lot of the comments brought up jiwoong and saying stuff like “zb1 again? as expected this is the group with kjw, why are they all rude like this?” god😭</p>
