      <p>since i saw some anons talking about hanbin's idol persona i want to vent a little bit. i'm probably going to sound mean but i'm so fucking tired of his constant fanservice istg... i tried to ignore it since the beginning but it's becoming so fucking unbearable i'm sorry ðŸ˜­ i got his bubble for a few months (i'm probably stupid too cause what the hell was i expecting) but him blowing up my phone every single day (and for long periods of time too) with bf-gf roleplay is insufferable... i had to unsubscribe lol. at least the other members are NOT that bad with the fanservice, it's quite average and bearable for me if that makes sense? i just wanted to get to know him more or something bruh i don't want to be your fuckass parasocial girlfriend even though almost everyone enjoys it ðŸ˜­ that's why i prefer an idol who might be a bit blunt but still sweet overall (like hao) because at least it feels more genuine to me for some reasons. at this point even hanbin's voice is fake af it's like he's constantly speaking with his customer service voice does he never get tired damn ðŸ’€ i don't doubt he's actually a kind person or whatever and i actually don't feel good about this but i gotta be honest he's giving me the ick so bad especially in some instances where i just have to roll my eyes a little bit i'm sorry lol</p>

      <p>I get it tbh i want to talk not about hanbin in particular but zb1 as a group generally (maybe other newer groups too), theyâ€™re the first new group i stan since years and iâ€™m kind of an old kpop stan its been like about 10 years since i got into it and i genuinely donâ€™t remember that the bf-gf fanservice was such a big thing at least when it comes to fansigns/calls, i genuinely hate seeing the repos because they just make me cringe and get annoying. like itâ€™s always the same questions like can we date for 5 seconds or what was your first impression of me or can i call you husband etc you get what i mean lol. and like ofc this happened in the past but from what i remember not to this extent? like from one fansign i could probably count the number of normal questions on my hand. maybe itâ€™s just because of the members i stan (yes itâ€™s hao and hanbin) but itâ€™s just sad to see like it feels like people only really care that they can have a handsome guy call them his wife or something. and ig the members encourage it themselves too since itâ€™s a part of their job but yeah i agree with anon hanbin does too much, hao for example only really indulges in it for fansigns and during lives etc heâ€™ll read like a comment or two for the gf stans and moves on. idk i feel like iâ€™m rambling i hope yall get my point (?) i just barely seen ppl think like me and maybe itâ€™s because i feel like a lot of zerose are newer kpop stans not an oldie like me</p>

      <p>No I get you too this group tapped into gf fanservice insanely like every group does it but I feel like wakeone was trying to use it as a tactic to build the fandom which worked. I feel like they've kind of weaned? idk at least my bias did but yea ig hanbin rllt sticks to it. And ur right this does feel so diff I've been into kpop for a while and it wasn't always like this but eh I don't mind too much

      <p>I guess it's either because he has a kpop degree or he enjoys the attention that he may have lacked in the past</p>

      <p>As someone who also had a big weight loss glow up I get super awkward when I get complimented and hit on cause I feel awkward ðŸ˜­I think he's just naturally flirty and playful and also attention seeking as all idols are, good for him that he has fun with it even if it's a lil cringe at least he enjoys his job</p>

      <p>It's his nature, he literally flirts with almost 80â€“90% of the ppl he interacts with, a true gemini but imo he actually doesn't flirt in bbl all the time al least i don't feel it maybe because i don't really gf stan him, so the time he actually flirts, it doesn't bother me
Also, i really like it when he is telling stories or sharing some daily anecdotes because he is a very animated person, and i love this type of ppl</p>
