      <p>My thoughts astrologically on Hanbin on a surface degree since we don't have the birth time and I'm not looking at his aspects; he has a really good chart for an artist esp a rapper he's a Gemini w a pisces moon like Kendrick, Kanye and Prince but one thing about Geminis as you can see w those examples they're kinda deranged ðŸ˜­? There's two sides to them which doesn't necessarily make him two faced for ex Kendrick has his Mr morale deep, smart, intelligent, kind and forgiving side and then his violent kinda immature side that he's well aware of he's also a mercury Gemini which makes him a great communicator (Geminis are ruled by mercury planet of intelligence and communication) he's heavy air chart (+sag mars and pisces moon) also gives him that kind of detached vibe so maybe he knows a lot of people but doesn't necessarily feels actually close to them even if they feel close to him, maybe he feels like no one really knows KNOWS him I think his mom said he would be a bad bf because of this and he said that he immediately clicked w Hao unlike any other before, maybe he has a hard time committing too</p>
