      <p>most to least stupid imo:
1. jiwoong (not his fault but he went to a bad high school or something along those lines. if i remember correctly hus old company screwed him over.)
2. gyuvin (he himself admitted that he wasnâ€™t a good student and his former teacher said it too. i agree that heâ€™s very emotionally intelligent tho.)
3. yujin (this kid does not go to school)
4. ricky (rumors that his grades were bad in school. can anyone confirm if he graduated high school genuine question.)
5. taerae and matthew (both were smart enough to go to college right? someone fact check me.)
7. hanbin (seems both academically and emotionally intelligent. we know that heâ€™s in college while working at the same time. did he graduate yet? someone fact check me again.)
8. gunwook (we all know heâ€™s super smart and was very involved in high school. probably wouldâ€™ve went to a sky university if he didnâ€™t take the idol path.)
9. hao (got into the best geosciences university in china and 17th best in the entire world. enough said.)
what do yâ€™all think?</p>

      <p>yea Ricky's grades were like 1.5 gpa and no he didn't graduate he was supposed to go to school in korea but he didn't but I think he's just smarter than gyuvin. Matthew was a health science major albeit he attended uni for one semester but I think I would tie him and hanbin and idk for taerae like at all and then yea

      <p>Nah i think heâ€˜s alr in Korea in 2021, iâ€˜ve read somewhere else that he shouldâ€™ve enrolled ideally in 2019, since he contacted his dance teacher 2 years after she scouted him. and 2019 makes sense for a lot of his narration so i think many have that as the general consensus.</p>

      <p>Yeah ig so, or maybe he started school early idk, because if he enrolled in fall 2020 it wouldve been kinda late for him to meet Hanbin or be close to him, since he was in hybe for a short while before moving to cube, and iirc hanbin left cube alr in late 2021. so im inclined to believe that he attended western in 2019, but thatâ€˜s just speculation idk</p>

      <p>He dropped out so that's doesn't necessarily mean he completed the semester but also ppl have some school info from him and no one said anything ab an early graduation so idk and it kind of makes sense that he doesn't have grad photo(?) (cmiiw I don't think he does?) cuz it would've been cancelled cuz of the pandemic
