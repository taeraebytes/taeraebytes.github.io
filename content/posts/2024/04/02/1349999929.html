      <p>amber heard a lying scheming psycho tho I watched the entire trial, even her lawyers were sighing at her lies and how she couldnt keep her story straight and wouldn't stfu while on stand opening gateways for johnnys legal team to tap in and discredit old domestic abuse rumors. Like if she stfu they would've never brought kate moss in to debunk johnny pushing her down the stairs.</p>

      <p>This was almost 2-3 yrs ago I don't rmbr much but there is undeniable undeniable evidence that he was abusing her like I'm sorry I don't believe in equal abuse she was retaliating and power and physical dynamics 🤷‍♀️
