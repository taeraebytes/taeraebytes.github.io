      <p>I am sorry but Hanbin is just so cunning and with good social skills that he has fooled y'all into thinking he's super academic smart when he said a lot of times that his grades at school were shit ðŸ˜­. And yeah he got a scholarship but that was bc of his dancing. Meanwhile we have Matthew who got into some nice university yet people don't perceive him as smart.

This is why being street smart is the best skill you can have, you can fool people easily into perceiving you the way you want to be perceived.</p>

      <p>also I think the global line looks slightly more dumb that they possibly are because they are not speaking in their native languages, as someone that speaks daily in my third language I feel like I lose a good 20 IQ while speaking it in comparison to when I do my native languageðŸ˜­</p>
