      <p>since i saw some anons talking about hanbin's idol persona i want to vent a little bit. i'm probably going to sound mean but i'm so fucking tired of his constant fanservice istg... i tried to ignore it since the beginning but it's becoming so fucking unbearable i'm sorry ðŸ˜­ i got his bubble for a few months (i'm probably stupid too cause what the hell was i expecting) but him blowing up my phone every single day (and for long periods of time too) with bf-gf roleplay is insufferable... i had to unsubscribe lol. at least the other members are NOT that bad with the fanservice, it's quite average and bearable for me if that makes sense? i just wanted to get to know him more or something bruh i don't want to be your fuckass parasocial girlfriend even though almost everyone enjoys it ðŸ˜­ that's why i prefer an idol who might be a bit blunt but still sweet overall (like hao) because at least it feels more genuine to me for some reasons. at this point even hanbin's voice is fake af it's like he's constantly speaking with his customer service voice does he never get tired damn ðŸ’€ i don't doubt he's actually a kind person or whatever and i actually don't feel good about this but i gotta be honest he's giving me the ick so bad especially in some instances where i just have to roll my eyes a little bit i'm sorry lol</p>
