      <p>I am sorry but Hanbin is just so cunning and with good social skills that he has fooled y'all into thinking he's super academic smart when he said a lot of times that his grades at school were shit ðŸ˜­. And yeah he got a scholarship but that was bc of his dancing. Meanwhile we have Matthew who got into some nice university yet people don't perceive him as smart.

This is why being street smart is the best skill you can have, you can fool people easily into perceiving you the way you want to be perceived.</p>

      <p>idk if any of you watched that pyramid game kdrama but hanbin really reminds me of some of the characters there ðŸ˜­ people used to call him cunning all the time during boys planet but imo he still is. we need to do a psychoanalysis of him next</p>

      <p>Not rly on the topic of him being cunning or whatever but Honestly with hanbin i wonder all the time if his niceness is really genuine or just a facade cus it's very impressive 
I feel like if he was just pretending to be nice you'd be able to see the cracks every now and then but he never budges he is LOCKED IN 
I guess maybe he really is just like that but he also seems so calculating  it throws me off</p>

      <p>I think he's both calculating and nice which could question the latter but also being kind and nice are two diff things to me. I think he's kind which makes him naturally that way like soft and thoughtful but him being nice like what he does towards others is probably partly him being calculated someone compared him to the mc of pyramid game and it's similar she's kind but she's rlly not that nice
