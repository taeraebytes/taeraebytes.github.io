      <p>matthew is not dumb what ðŸ˜­ he was literally studying biology in a pretty good university in canada. ricky should be higher sorry we all know he wasnâ€™t that good at school and there IS enough evidence for taerae yâ€™all just donâ€™t pay attention to him ðŸ˜­ heâ€™s not like the smartest but heâ€™s a pretty logical thinker 

i think it should go (from dumbest to smartest)

gyuvin
jiwoong 
ricky
yujin
matthew
taerae
hanbin 
gunwook
hao</p>

      <p>I think being bookish education is diffrent thing and being smart is different thing. Hao is bookish smart but not street smart same goes to gunwook. Hanbin is street smart.</p>
