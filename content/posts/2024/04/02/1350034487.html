      <p>Ex-ceo of ktown4u shared zb1â€™s comeback in May will be catered towards the US. Perhaps an english song? If wakeone is aiming for the western market they need to play their cards right and not disappoint korean fans. isnâ€™t that crazy for a temporary rookie group not from the big4 to cater towards the US? Wakeone has huge plans for them, letâ€™s see how theyâ€™ll do.</p>

      <p>I don't see how they would cater towards the us like okay an English song on the album that's fine but don't come over here and end up like 2019 nct 127 PLEASE GOD NOOOOOOOOðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ like I don't see how it could be anything else other than those two? They might do smth with HELLO82 maybe omg what if they do a fansign... BRO IDK WHO TOLD THEM TO DO THISðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
