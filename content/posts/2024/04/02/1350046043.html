      <p>I feel this way about Ricky kinda he was my one pick and I paid tons of money for him but I actually prefer him being inactive cause sometimes when he talks he just makes me cringe sm..but tbh I'm just not normally into kpop so I'm not used to those kinda things I also cringe when members call us princess wife etcðŸ’€</p>
