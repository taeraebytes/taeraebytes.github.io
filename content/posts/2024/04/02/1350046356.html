      <p>"I'm sorry but most of them are boring and also because of the language barrier I feel like his jokes don't hit as much but there's also other members who are funnier" anon you probably just are not as invested in hanbin as you probably are to other members, its normal to feel bored when you dont really feel anything for said member. 

the humor thing is really true tho. hanbins humor is REALLY korean humor, its also true that he doesn’t really even joke around alot.

 he also kind of puts up a front towards the fans/on bubble lives. he definetely knows how he wants to be perceived and is acting according to that. fans love controlling their idols, hanbin is great at making it seem like they are controlling him by being overly nice and kind worded but he has clear lines that can not be stepped on (where he "jokingly" calls fans out on lives).</p>
