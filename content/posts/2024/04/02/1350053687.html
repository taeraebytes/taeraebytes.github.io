      <p>Jiwoong really pisses me off so much you can tell he dgaf about this group ðŸ˜­ Idc how many times he will try to pull the oldest hyung card itâ€™s so obvious when heâ€™s asked about other members he just says a random name (saying hanbin is the loneliest member ðŸ˜­ or saying hao is the most romantic one which was funny af since hanbin basically said the opposite ðŸ˜­) For every single member you could at least name one other member that theyâ€™re close with but for jiwoong? Not a single one lmao i used to think itâ€™s Matthew but it looks like they fell out or something. He doesnâ€™t bring anything into the group he always tries to do some bad gaybait instead of interacting with the members normally like none of us asked for this. He seriously needs to lock in or something because he genuinely ruins content for me sometimes ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>no cause during the bbl live when he was getting asked all these 5 y.o (insert member) vs 5 (insert member) I was like he does not even interact with 1 how do you expect him to interact with 5 of them</p>

      <p>off topic but this reminds me of when Matthew was asked to choose 5 Gunwook and 5 yr old Gunwook he chose the latter because he doesnt want to share his love for 5 Gunwooks, which means the current Gunwook will receiveless affection ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it was so sweet oml and i think itâ€™s the first time ive heard this kind of reaction to this question. pls pls redebut again together plsssss</p>
