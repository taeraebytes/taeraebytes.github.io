      <p>I still for the life of me cant understand why he did that. idols rarely respond to hate like that and when they do its usually during like a live stream and they just make a slight psa to be nice. But to fully write a comment reply to hate is weird and attention seeking</p>

      <p>Well he wasn't the only one getting those comments and other members had it worse but they never acknowledged any of the hate üëç hope this helps anon and people are allowed to question a certain behavior especially if its consequences were bad on the fandom like his solos and akgaes never stopped terrorizing everyone since then</p>
