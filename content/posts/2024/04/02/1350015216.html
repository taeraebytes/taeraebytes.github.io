    "question": "Well even most gpds didnâ€™t care about the Gunwook ssg issue and just waited for it to die down. monoghost and friends asked ppl to not intervene and let k-fans do their own thing so what do u expect from ot-9 fans if his own solo stans ask them to not do shit for him",
    "reply": "yea ur tapped monoghost is a half baked dummy and the situation was terribleðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­???? It's not that they didn't care only like 5% of intl gpds knew and it was mainly because of me that they knew don't irk bruh. His own kfans were dumbfounded on what to do AND THEY DIDNT EVEN HANDLE IT its thanks to do-ings annoyed friends that people finally let it die down because it had concrete proof. The original post had a lot of mistakes in the photoshopping but ppl just like to ride on hate and ignored it and the acc posting everything had 10k followers.. and was collaborating with bbosongee... his fans were trying to ignore it away but it wasn't working and then it reached the j side with DOUBLE the traction because he's the most popular like I had to start asking my mutuals to contact bases to send info and release statements ðŸ˜’. Thank u god that her friends turned on her and doxxed her idk how much worse it would've gotten if it didn't get cleared it was so scary. Eventually when it started to seep into discussion zerose spaces weeks later even with the pieces of proof left (the ops nuked their threads cuz they hate their friend but they also don't like gunwook..) they still decided that yes they know gunwook yes he would do this yes everyone else is wrong like they're so dumb"
