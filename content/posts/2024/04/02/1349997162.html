      <p>i think zb1 is criticized more harshly than riize too, and i also think that jiwoong scandal is part of the reason why knetz r so harsh on them lol in today‚Äôs hao scandal on pann a lot of the comments brought up jiwoong and saying stuff like ‚Äúzb1 again? as expected this is the group with kjw, why are they all rude like this?‚Äù godüò≠</p>

      <p>they r both kinda dumb but what sets them apart is their likeability like atp ur comparing apples to fucking oranges its gyuvin the most likeable member who lacks awareness kinda but u had to love him vs gramps who u just have to put up with sigh 

tbh they were never my picks for bp so ive allowed time for both of them to grow on me (gyuvin has succeeded in getting into top 4 i consider him a good friend) but man i just cannot get into jiwoong and angtakkjung just made that almost impossible</p>
