Not a single one lmao i used to think itâ€™s Matthew but it looks like they fell out or something. He doesnâ€™t bring anything into the group he always tries to do some bad gaybait instead of interacting with the members normally like none of us asked for this. He seriously needs to lock in or something because he genuinely ruins content for me sometimes ðŸ˜­",
