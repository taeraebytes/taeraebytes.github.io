      <p>Honestly I love them too but it's so transparent this fandom mostly cares about haobin ðŸ˜­if any of those two have issues entire twitter and subreddit will be full of support unlike with any other members, ofc other members are loved but the difference can be jarring</p>

      <p>You can count on me not toðŸ™ˆ but yea I find it annoying it's not only them it's usually a good 5 they probably ride for but haobin more so. I was sooooooo mad when the ssg photoshop thing happened w gunwook most of these people turned on him like this was in his character to or smth like it's obvious half these ppl still hate him andddd u should just all kill urselves too tbhðŸ˜’
