      <p>Basically April fools gave an insight to who the kgp thinks are the visuals of ZB1 and I'm scared to say their names, two members specifically because I just know they're gonna get jumped here knowing which fandoms lurk here ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>There's a reason why I didn't mention them because I know ur cc are prob thinking Hao since his fans lurk here the most (I think) and his fandom already hates those two but it's Ricky and Yujin. Also when I mean fansites I mean other fandoms not Gunwook fansite posting Hao etc. and those two I saw the most with really good engagements from really big accounts too and my acc is basically gpd/ ot9 so it's not even like my tl is catered to those two, I genuinely just saw the most of those two.</p>
