      <p>rosins are mad af, their reporting every weird comment and at a point, it got too much so they are just reporting any comments that has a haobin pfp ðŸ˜­ and now haobinists are mad at rosins because some of the reported comments are simply asking general questions and rosins are like 'hao is recieving hate and you're only concern is a fellow haobinist comment being removed?'  sjndmdkd it's a mess rn and they're literally arguing right under his chat oh God ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Select the message the translation feature will pop up hit translate you have the translation all in under 30 seconds and another pro tip maybe don't report comments that have been liked by hao or comments hes replied to
