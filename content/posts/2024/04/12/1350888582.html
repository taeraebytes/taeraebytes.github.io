      <p>rosins are mad af, their reporting every weird comment and at a point, it got too much so they are just reporting any comments that has a haobin pfp 😭 and now haobinists are mad at rosins because some of the reported comments are simply asking general questions and rosins are like 'hao is recieving hate and you're only concern is a fellow haobinist comment being removed?'  sjndmdkd it's a mess rn and they're literally arguing right under his chat oh God 😭</p>

      <p>Select the message the translation feature will pop up hit translate you have the translation all in under 30 seconds and another pro tip maybe don't report comments that have been liked by hao or comments hes replied to

      <p>A lot of it has never been about antis, but about controlling Hao🤫 which is funny because hao is a free spirit and has been very purposeful in his actions</p>

      <p>You didn’t hear this from me but a big part of the mass reporting was because he replied to 2 haobinist and they did not like that. That’s why even the ones he already replied to got reported.</p>
