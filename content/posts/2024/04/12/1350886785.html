      <p>At a kpop event overseas a female idol felt dizzy and fainted backstage. The staff gave her water but apparently she was aggressive and shouted that she only drinks starbucks and made one of the local team get her an ice frappe. Mind you she made them go at night during the show where there probably werenâ€™t any close by lol.
This is maybe the third  staff I've seen complaint about this particular group and especially that one member, ironic considering the groups concept!</p>
