      <p>"An A-list idol group member 'A' is said to have fallen in love with none other than fellow member 'B'. They've apparently been dating for five years now and the scandal is expected to be huge especially considering that they're idol members from the same top level group. A and B were actually caught by a paparazzi last year but came to a compromise with paparazzi company C to bury the articles. A and B are still continuing their relationship." (2016)</p>
