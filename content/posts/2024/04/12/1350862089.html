      <p>Frankly looking at hanbins past he doesn't seem hetero or bi like some of his cc answers, his parents letter to him and offhand comments, the motae solo thing, his mostly female friend group, his jarhyun obsession like calling him baby and stuff, the fact that he could do topless photoshoot w girls and slap them in the ass..etc would be very weird and borderline inappropriate if he was interested in women but at the same time has straight men interests 

However , although I am pretty confident that at least hanbin and Ricky (credible ex bf rumour) are queer there's a lot that points in this direction there's one thing that has been bugging me and that is their closeness to gyuvins Very Christian family lol;  ik gyuvin introduces all of his friends to his family ofc and no I don't think gyuvin is bigoted but I think it's interesting that he introduced pretty much all of his close friends to his family including all yuehiaz BUT hao? Esp since they're very close lately ü§î
Ofc I'm pulling at straws maybe his parents aren't homophobic and he invited hao and just hasn't told it yet or they're just not THAT close but NGL I've been thinking this for a while</p>
