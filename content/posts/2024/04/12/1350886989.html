      <p>A+ list idol is or was in a process of heechulization lol.
He is always fanboying hard on the it girl of the moment, chasing a A list female idol at ISAC back in the days, going out with B+ list female idol a bit after, months ago he was seen with a more recent A list female idol at a concert (they even left together separated from the rest-a fansite of the female idol on twitter confirmed it was her with the male idol and a staff hanging out together, there's even pictures,  idk what kind of relationship they have but they're hanging out with eachother pretty often, while maybe flirting with another famous female idol around the same time 
He is in that famous GC, it's no wonder Heechul said recently that he likes hanging out with them group and even called one of them an alpha male LMAO they're all F boys</p>
