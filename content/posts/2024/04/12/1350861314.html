      <p>Idol star A, who is gaining popularity for his innocent image, is infamous for his rough, free-spirited private life unlike his image. A is worrying others because he's been obsessed with R-rated films. A is very much into a hard-core genre. A's schedules have been cut short for various reasons. He spends his free time with R-rated contents. A has unusual preferences and his actual attitude is also thoughtless and rough. He doesn't have good reputation from his friends and girlfriends he met after debuting. Because of his preferences, he had a lot of conflicts with his girlfriends as well. But there's no one in his agency who can stop A's unusual preferences, so they can't do anything but sigh. (July 1 - 2020)</p>
