      <p>"An A-list idol group member 'A' is said to have fallen in love with none other than fellow member 'B'. They've apparently been dating for five years now and the scandal is expected to be huge especially considering that they're idol members from the same top level group. A and B were actually caught by a paparazzi last year but came to a compromise with paparazzi company C to bury the articles. A and B are still continuing their relationship." (2016)</p>

      <p>i've seen this one before. saw ppl say infinite which would make sense (although i actually don't know a single thing about the members lmao) bc if whoever it was started dating 2011 then it would've only been 1 year after debut and i can't imagine idols in the same group suddenly randomly dating each other midway in their career, if same group idols were to do that it'd probably be from trainee years to rookie years at the most idk, so it probably wouldn't be an earlier 2nd gen group... or maybe it would be a 3rd gen group who were training in 2011 (bts, exo... um idk who else is considered an a-list 3rd gen bg in 2016 and even then bts were just getting there). this could easily be fake i'm just hyper analysing LMAO</p>
