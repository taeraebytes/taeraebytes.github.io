Both sweat and the tt have good charts but the tt in particular is really good I am expecting her to be sexy in some way because if she's releasing at 6pm she would be a Scorpio rising, the mc (career house) would be in Leo which id perfect because our center id a Leo sun+Venus (planet of art) the song will probably have direct, maybe emotional or sensual lyrics? On the 13th may Jupiter will be transitioning in zb1s 5th house (house of creativity fun music etc) which means that they will have luck in these areas also looking at other hit kpop dongs there's a lot of similarities in this track so on paper everything is well now it just depends on the company",
