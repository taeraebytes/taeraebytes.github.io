      <p>"taerae said the songs (in the upcoming album) are nice! he also said he'll change his pfp when the 3rd album is released!

üê• i'm not sleepy, my throat is quite sore, i'll come back again when i'm better

he said that rather than cover songs, his own song might be coming out?" 
Ost? Or they're actually writing?</p>
