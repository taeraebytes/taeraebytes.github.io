      <p>i didnt wanna come to this point but it feels like it was one of those situations where gyuvin would feed ricky korean memes and explicit jokes without giving context and ricky just following along (explains why he would do that in PUBLICðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ + and also how quick gyuvin was to make him stop) thoughts?</p>

      <p>We have eyes u know he just moved his middle and ring finger and ik what bitna looks like..... but alright.. ok I went back to watch the video cuz u guys are doing tm and he was specifically moving his two middle fingers and they both looked scared of the cameras gyuvin more so at Ricky before he even saw the cameras..? And then he started doing the actual bitna (with all his fingers cuz that's how it's supposed to be) because if THAT is the bitna wouldnt there have been fingering jokes rinsed from the very beginning since last yr? yea dont try to make me sound crazy when it was very clear what he was doing and the joke he was making it's not that deepðŸ˜­

      <p>yes he does.. alright this is just a matter of the blind vs not blind the gesture in the first video is the same as the second gesture in the second video not the first one. I've stressed a million times I genuinely don't care and that it was funny but u ppl are trying to act like I'm slow when I didn't even care to begin with and first watch from 2 angles it looked a certain way ..ðŸ˜­ if it didn't why would there be a debate GET GONE
