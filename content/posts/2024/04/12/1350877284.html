      <p>Lol I'm anon tarot, I'm afraid oomf will catch me because she didn't post this public but she did this reading two weeks before they  announced Sweat. There are two results, either this song is very good or this song is only mediocre. Because at that time it seemed like they hadn't finished production yet. The company invests a lot so they keep adding new details and putting pressure on the members, making them stressed. They have two sides, one is to keep the old concept (hb gw gv), Hb belongs to this team because he feels the group has too many scandals, so he keeps the same image to overcome this time first, gw actually also wanted to change but he and gv both chose to support the leader , the other side wanted to get rid of that image (Mt, H, Tr), (rk yj) didnt participate, and it looks like Mt team won. She also mentioned that fresh concept is better</p>
