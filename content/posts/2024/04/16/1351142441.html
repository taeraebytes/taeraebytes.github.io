    "question": "Some people might argue it’s the age gap between Jiwoong and everyone else that makes it weird but like that’s only 2 years between him and Hao??? And everyone likes Hao in the group. Jiwoong really gives me the vibes that he’s very uptight but also requires there to be exceptions only for him. Like trying to orchestrate other people and when they don’t do what he wants he “teases” them. It’s fundamentally huge insecurity and a control issues problem, which could likely happen given how many bad experiences and the nature of those experiences he’s had in the idol world. I’ve been through similar things as him and it made me become like that when I was a teen and I was insufferable looking back, it’s all a defense mechanism and bad socialization. Like you really think the guy that got teased for failing a super easy school on Knowing Bros will have peak intrapersonal friendship skills? Or the guy who was part of genuinely evil companies that sabotaged his debut twice wouldn’t develop control issues and want to feel in control of any narrative surrounding him? All this being said, there’s only so much empathy can cover for his actions and at the end of the day someone making others uncomfortable is inexcusable",
