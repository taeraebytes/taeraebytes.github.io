      <p>Imo the sales will be more than fine, just take a look at their japanese single, they're about to reach 600k soon and that was their debut. We should worry about their prerelease because it will either make or break them, and with bnd achieving good results now and riize coming soon, they need to make a name for themselves.</p>

      <p>What i meant is that the korean gp are finally tuning in for boygroups since bnd entered the chart. Zb1 has a chance to  do really well if their songs are good, however since other bgs are coming back at the same time, the competition on the charts is gonna be intense. Fanwars too</p>

      <p>Yea lowkey the tides are turning for bgs AND ZB1 ARE RESPONSIBLE SORRY THEY CHANGED THE GAME FOR 5TH GEN BGS IDC riize and bnd were so obviously created during the bp hype lol but yes they do have a chance and their negative exposure will put a little spotlight on them I think all the little changes wakeone has been making will lead up to this point god be with us
