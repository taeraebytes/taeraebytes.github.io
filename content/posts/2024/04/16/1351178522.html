      <p>anonsties rosins dgaf about sales going down. they just don't wanna keep giving their money to a company that sees their cfans as cash cows. that mnet app can't be accessed in china unless they use vpn ðŸ˜­ i think all the cbars should follow zh and yjn bar and boycott the comeback atleast it will make an impact on the sales revenue. wakeone is an incompetent ass company, if you're willing to spend money on them even after all the shit they pull, you're just a hopeless case</p>

      <p>they're not gonna take a hit sales wise and yes wakeone are incompetent but they manage zb1 what can u do ab that? and calling ppl who will buy hopeless cases is also just dumb because it will change nothing wakeone is not going to miraculously change and they're still supporting the group ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ the company and group are tied together this is why boycotts are carefully planned and discussed and happen rarely almost never in kpop this isn't even  a boycott or a fan wide one at that
