I'm gonna catch it but idc, I don't understand the month's of 'accumulated disappointment' argurment when his treatment has only gotten better since crush. He always has the most line distribution, literally always in the center for everything and been getting solo gigs like ost and loewe china event. Like what more? I'm not even defending wakeone but they obviously stepped up their game with Hao since in bloom.</p>

      <p>I was talking to janghaneul ab this earlier and I feel like everyone rlly just personalizes wakeones incompetence like it's rlly not exclusive and idky it's shocking either 😭 I expected about half of the shit they went thru already when we found out wakeone was going to manage them but also ur right they have been trying to accommodate too so idk the expectations are too high there are valid concerns but it's like the baseline circumstances are forgotten this is just mid ass wakeone and a group on a time crunch theres rlly no time. and yea he's center and actually treated pretty adequately compared to other survival show centers but for whatever shit wakeone dishes out he rarely has it the worst there's folks out here who haven't seen the promo light EVER

      <p>you will never understand them be cause it's not your bias like duh 😭 hao has been getting targeted with harassment, defamatory rumors since the group was formed, threatening to ruin his career and racist disgusting comments and the company didn't lift a finger to even post empty threatening statements. 
he started to get the bare minimum as the center and main vocalist and post popular member after their SECOND album, "gets the most lines" fucking duh that's a main vocalist but is never given interesting parts that showcase his vocals or high notes, "stands in the center most of time" it's almost like .. that's the bare minimum for the center of a temporary group.
if you bothered to read his c-bar's statement about the emails response objectively for a second without being bitchy about c-fans cause yall go bat shit crazy whenever zh and them are involved you'd realize the crazy shit wakeone is pulling, they're leaving them on read and not responding to emails about mic and in-ears procedures necessary to complete them and gifts for his birthday that's coming up... these people have every right to be upset and comparing how wakeone treats other members / other centers is just plain dumb and a set up like ok should they settle for bare minimum and mediocrity and keep filling the company's pockets with money that funds events these c-fans don't even get to attend 😢 ☠️☠️☠️☠️ I don't think you people realize how shitty and unfair the situation is</p>

      <p>Okay again legal action within the kpop industry is a rarity to begin with and even more so in a company like wakeone. In order to adequately sue and clean up rumors and hate they have to have designated staff and pay fees which they do not have most of their staff quit very early on and it's likely that wakeone was in debt before zb1. I'm not saying this was right, no wakeone should've prepared months in advance for the group but it's just a matter of the companies bounds. I've had to watch a consistent brutal hate train against my own bias with malicious rumors and constant hate articles as well but it's just a reality that nothings going to be handled and that half assed statement was never for him anyways. And AGAIN.. ur just listing things a mid kpop company would do the expectations were truly too high and saying you would never settle for bare minimum is just 😭😭😭 that's all ur getting I'm sorry and if the attempt at some changes arent enough then idk what to tell u this company is built off of overworked understaffed employees bare minimum is the best we're gonna get with this severely under promoted group like we're at less than 2 years time now. And I did read the statement please save the catty paragraphs for the right person you're coming onto my platform about things I've thoroughly discussed and come correct as well the cbars for the most part are treated the same they've all had their emails ignored they've all been told no it's a matter of what individual bars release zhbar updates on every move while the others only post finalizations of course it looks different??? And yea you're just tapped cfans don't attend events.... there had to have been smth better u could've said

      <p>i know damn well you're not comparing hao to that girl 😭 sucks for her to be treated that way but it's unfortunate she doesn't have many fans or impact for wk1 to respect her center position how is that hao's fault y'all make me ctfu</p>

      <p>Regardless she's a center in the same company so even if hao has a billion fans it should've been somewhat expected? Like you can't demand respect from a company who does this to their own trainee who won and came in first for a survival show especially since Kepler also were doing pretty ok in the beginning 😭😭😭😭 like what made u think they were gonna kiss haos feet
