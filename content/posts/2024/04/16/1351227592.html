      <p>that would have to do with his contract? Like you could buy a billion albums that's not gonna change anythingüò≠???? and he probably did get more profit from lofficiel but that's also depending on their contract u guys need to think a little

      <p>How would you know who get the most profit I'd be surprised if he's not the most paid in zb1, if you meant that the higher ups get more money well yes kpop is ultraczpitalistic? Honestly he's probably very well off</p>

      <p>We don't that's the thing and I'm just assuming their contract details have the terms for their profit so outside factors will not change anything

      <p>i‚Äôve heard that foreign members used to get paid less, does anybody know if it is different now? also hao probably had a lot of trainee debt since he had to stay in dorms and take kor courses while eg gyuvin who i think trained the longest lived with his parents and already spoke korean and afaik the debt is usually crazy numbers that most idols can only  pay off years after debuting (like daisy from mamamoo was a local and had 150k debt) 
also i‚Äôve heard mag feature sales money doesn‚Äôt really go to idols or celebs in general and they are paid in ‚Äúexposure‚Äù 
so ironically hao might be one of the members who has made the least amount of money till now</p>

      <p>woah now I just don't think for zb1 it is considering their foreign center and the other foreign members one some of the highest ranks regardless the contracts they most likely have with wakeone are an even profit split with them then their second contract with their respective companies is where the differences come in

      <p>it's not about contract or companies bruh it's government rules you can think of it as a form of taxes, since they're making money in korea they basically say they can't make this much money or at least as easily in their home countries. not just idols it's an issue with most foreign workers</p>
