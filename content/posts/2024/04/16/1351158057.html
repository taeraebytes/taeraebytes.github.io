      <p>Don’t speak on taerae u know nothing about him. He’s being dragged by homophobic knetz, people bully him for acting too feminine, for his ggs tiktok covers and having friends outside zb1 and his response was another super lady challenge and vlog with wakeonez on zb1’s official channel. It’s not his fault he’s unbothered king👑 and doesn’t let haters rule him unlike ur bias. I will pray for u getting a deathly illness U GOTTA DIE🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻</p>
