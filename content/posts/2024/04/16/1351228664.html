      <p>Imo the sales will be more than fine, just take a look at their japanese single, they're about to reach 600k soon and that was their debut. We should worry about their prerelease because it will either make or break them, and with bnd achieving good results now and riize coming soon, they need to make a name for themselves.</p>

      <p>if we’re going based solely off music/quality/concepts bnd washes but kpop fans dgaf abt that so they will probably always fall short of other groups. idc tho bc as long as they continue to give us good music they can stay indie</p>

      <p>well they’ve already outcharted loona (and most 4th gen bgs) in korea but idc if they don’t get big im just there for the music & a lot of times the moment someone gets mainstream, the quality goes down. they sold 500k first day on their album so they won’t disband anytime soon and that’s enough for me</p>
