      <p>hanbin gets dragged on here for his vocal, dance, personality, not bringing in new fans from his mc schedules, and lots of different things. but i realized these are people behind a keyboard hiding under anonymous who have not even met him irl or even know him like that. different people have different likes so their opinion really don't matter much. i always kept reminding myself that as long as hanbin has me that is fine, everyone else can hate him for all i care. i will be there for him.</p>
