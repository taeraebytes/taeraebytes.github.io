      <p>ngl the promotion of each member in this group is pretty equal and im not always sure its a good thing bc now everyone expects their bias to be The Person and not everyone can be The Person like idk i always tend to bias some of the least popular members of groups i stan so maybe im just used to it but even the least popular members in jebewon get their flowers sometimes so ???? it really could be worse guys lets smile a little</p>
