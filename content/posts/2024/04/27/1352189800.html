Sorry but some rosins are just being dense on purpose ðŸ˜¬ akgaes were intentionally making a big deal out of that move to shade one of the members. I'm pretty sure he and the staff can figure out how to solve it if that choreo is actually a recurring issue.

It's actually irking me like why are you being dramatic as if they said that to spite rosins unprovoked when they're just being defensive because of what happened.

It's honestly disappointing to see moots acting without reason because this is just akgae behavior</p>
