Sorry but some rosins are just being dense on purpose ðŸ˜¬ akgaes were intentionally making a big deal out of that move to shade one of the members. I'm pretty sure he and the staff can figure out how to solve it if that choreo is actually a recurring issue.

It's actually irking me like why are you being dramatic as if they said that to spite rosins unprovoked when they're just being defensive because of what happened.

It's honestly disappointing to see moots acting without reason because this is just akgae behavior</p>

      <p>bc everything started with that account that was fatshaming hanbin, no one said anything about the dance until they decided to make that weird comment and they also posted a picture of hanbin saying that he needed to lose weight so for them to be so passionate asking about the dancing they would have to rt or side with the other account first, that's why op was reacting like that.</p>
