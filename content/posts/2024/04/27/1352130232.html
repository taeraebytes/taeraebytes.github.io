      <p>(i need to preface this by saying i acknowledge that jiwoongâ€™s past most likely has affected him in ways weâ€™ll never truly understand and i donâ€™t wanna detract from that) i hateee thinking too deep about these things and iâ€™m not accusing him of anything outright but jiwoongâ€™s behavior with sohee is making it more noticeable to me that he justâ€¦ has weird tendencies idk. it could very much be unintentional on his end like maybe he just doesnâ€™t know what hes doing is making the other person uncomfortable lmao but for none of the members to share anecdotes with him and the members he used to be close with (matthew) distancing themselves from him his presence in the group doesnâ€™t sit right with me at all and this is coming from someone who used to be his fan (he was even my 1pick during boys planet) plus i know maknae x matnae friendships in groups arent uncommon at all but the way jiwoong kind of clings to yujin a lot has always been weird to me. just wanted to let this out somewhere i feel like iâ€™d get stoned if i said this out loud lol</p>
