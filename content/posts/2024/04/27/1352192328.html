      <p>He mentioned originally it was too hard on both him and hao and cyj suggested hanbin come up a solution so he added a tutting move that made it easier and it's the first time he's done choreo for the group. I rlly don't know how that is egging akgaes on or if they're talking ab smth else

      <p>akgaes took what he said and were like "he made the choreo easier for himself and your bias and shit" they were tagging zhbar and stuff and some were telling them to apologize but nothing serious since none of them are talking about it anymore. akgaes from both sides just being akgaes 🙃</p>
