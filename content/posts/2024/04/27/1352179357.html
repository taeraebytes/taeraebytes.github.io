      <p>I always found it strange that hao in particular has such a crazy parasocial fanbase when he doesn't play into parasocialism nearly as much as the average idol, doesn't really share anything about his life, doesn't seem to even like to be victimized and coddled by his fan base and SHOWS IT, he's a very outspoken direct person..like why are they even like this at all?? 

I wonder if the post finale mess permanently made his fan base much more schizo because they feel like they know him on a very personal level? 
I find the psychology of Stan culture very interesting, it's easier to get the crazy jungkook nicki or Taylor swift fans because the artists play into parasocialsm a lot but it's a lot harder with the bp, aespa or in this case zh schizos</p>

      <p>I think with the whole overprotective attitude and cfan culture kind of spreading thru irosins as a result of his huuuge cfandom mixed with natural solo tendencies from survival show stanning u just kind of have the worst mix. And it's only really with irosins on twitter that I see which is so funny cuz mostly all they do is larpüò≠ both j and krosins are chiller and levelheaded and even if they have qualms it's rarely ever in a public setting and crosins have their own culture that they're used to and use entirely different platforms. And when you're in an environment like that where it's only yes men and like minded ppl only yea u just no longer have a basis in reality even to the point u create an image for ur bias. It's definitely not all rosins there are chill ones but there's an overwhelming almost majority thatre like this so it drowns out normalcy

      <p>It's like a weird parental parasocialsm for them rather than the average gf fan (which is where allins fall) so it's a different akgae fanbase than the average bg, also obviously celebrities that have gotten hate or had something terrible happen to them immediately create a crazier more protective fan base (which is why Nicki talks about the industry being against her all the time, Taylor still talks about the kimye drama etc) now I will give it to hao that he himself is very tough and never let these things affect him at least publicly and he doesn't really validate his fans craziness in general but well nothing he does or say will really change anything atp as you said can culture slipped into the intl fanbase and a lot of them are more loyal to their fanbase that they see as an extension of themselves than to Hao himself</p>

      <p>Oh trueaxxxx that was bad time and I don't blame them for being overprotective I just wish sometimes they could be levelheaded and I know it's possible to be so when his large Korean and Japanese fanbases usually are. Let's pray for these folk üôè and ur right I guess it was inevitable in a way they seem to have followed the cfanbase even tho things work so different for them I guess it's cuz they were well I think they still are the biggest and most dedicated. I wonder how different things would be if irosins followed the kfanbase closer instead

      <p>Yeah I feel personally protective of Hao and am always careful with my wording when talking about him cause he obviously went through some terrible stuffs publicly and I respect him for being so strong and holding up so well (I'm not sure what I would do in his shoes at all) but I am also a mentally healthy woman and can recognise that this is a grown independent adult man that shouldn't and doesn't desire to be babied, I feel bad for him honestly because i think hes one of the more competitive members who seem to care about numbers and recognition a lot more</p>

      <p>Ok let me not get mad I see ur trynna be slick mouthed but it's cool it's cool it's coolüòÇüòÇ. The same thing happened to gunwook... NO YOU WOULDNT LAST AN HOUR IN THE ASYLUM I WAS RAISED IN BECUAE IT ALREADY HAS!!!!!! No screentime in in bloom second to last lines a pelvis/thigh smth injury we still don't know what cuz wakeone never released a statement and when a fan asked gunwook he laughed and asked them not to worry. And then crush bottom 3 again for lines and screentime all he got was the little hop he just kinged out so hard gunwook fans have only gotten a nibble of the royalty he deserves so far don't talk to me about if it happened to gunwooküòíüòíüòí we've been in poverty since day1. And the fake twitter account had 10k fucking followers and the biggest ktwt trolls dragging him and then 3 top 10 pann articles like that could have been reputation shattering????????? Of course I lost my mind I almost cried THEY WERE TEARING HIM UP ON ALL SIDES OF TWITTER FOR A WEEK STRAIGHT and even tho everything is cleared up and everyone saw the sasaeng expose thread trolls still use it against him monthly like I know you would kill yourself if that happened to hao those were actual accusationsüòë you would've committed living my life ughüòí aaaaand this is my cc I say whatever I want and I'm one girl you can't compare this because 0 gpds knew about the situation I had to handle business BY MYSELFüñï
