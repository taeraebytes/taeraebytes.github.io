      <p>Thankfully the eras short and I don't think they'll think that😭 but they'll be sad the live audiences have been good to them minus jiwoong but he doesn't gaf so🤷‍♀️ let's just hope they remain headstrong I'm gonna try to start caring less about charting too I'll be happier lowering my expectations
