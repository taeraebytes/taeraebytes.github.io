      <p>This is all jiwoong's fault I'm sorry I just cant get over this, the song is genuinely so good but ppl are just not streaming and I cant believe wakeone has given him so many lines knowing how fcking bad his rep is, I'm soooo mad I finally thought we'd be over crush era and be good again but I personally feel like this era is the worst. Few are satisfied but most are dissatisfied, especially the 2 biggest subfandoms of the group, everything's a mess from all the sides, wakeone is shit at promoting like who asked for a US push? Could have used that money that went into the movie promo for literally anything else. Intl akgaes fights have gotten worse kzeroses are either adamant in not streaming, some big company is against us and all these fandoms laughing at us WHEN ZB1 WERE LIKE THE FIRST BG IN FOREVER TO ACTUALLY ENTER THE CHARTS IM SO FUCKING MAD AND SAD IM NOT EVEN CHART OBSESSED BUT THIS IS SO DISHEARTENING TO SEE....the only good thing is that I feel like we have grown quite a lot on the intl side at least</p>

      <p>Literally... literally..... I cant believe what's unfolding I felt sooooo good about this rollout things were looking up.. kfans were forgiving them for the japan debut, they were going viral again, they improved insanely, bbosongee deactivated, the teaser photos were pretty, the teaser sounded amazing, jiwoong was still hated but we were forgetting he existed, they opened 1 month of preorders... LIKE SO MANY THINGS WERE GOING RIGHT WE WERE HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME WHY WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. And exactly these bg fans need to actually calm the fuck down we built this place for you zb1 created an interest for boy groups and I'm sowwwwy they truly started the fifth gen like bnd and riize need to kiss their feetðŸ˜’. Akgaes were piping down and nobody was trynna argue with me on cc I feel so sorry for this group and for us like I'm sick to my stomach. Jiwoong I have nothing to say to you and it's worse that I don't even hate him I'm just so indifferent to this broad it's not even worth jumping him every second it changes nothing... swing entertainment please change our lives.

      <p>We were able to achieve some achievements like iTunes because of ot9 rosins from zhg shared their strategies to zb1 global fanbase, otherwise we would be in trenches but we surpassed crush 1st day streams in spotify surprisingly</p>
