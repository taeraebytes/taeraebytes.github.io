      <p>I always found it strange that hao in particular has such a crazy parasocial fanbase when he doesn't play into parasocialism nearly as much as the average idol, doesn't really share anything about his life, doesn't seem to even like to be victimized and coddled by his fan base and SHOWS IT, he's a very outspoken direct person..like why are they even like this at all?? 

I wonder if the post finale mess permanently made his fan base much more schizo because they feel like they know him on a very personal level? 
I find the psychology of Stan culture very interesting, it's easier to get the crazy jungkook nicki or Taylor swift fans because the artists play into parasocialsm a lot but it's a lot harder with the bp, aespa or in this case zh schizos</p>

      <p>I think with the whole overprotective attitude and cfan culture kind of spreading thru irosins as a result of his huuuge cfandom mixed with natural solo tendencies from survival show stanning u just kind of have the worst mix. And it's only really with irosins on twitter that I see which is so funny cuz mostly all they do is larp😭 both j and krosins are chiller and levelheaded and even if they have qualms it's rarely ever in a public setting and crosins have their own culture that they're used to and use entirely different platforms. And when you're in an environment like that where it's only yes men and like minded ppl only yea u just no longer have a basis in reality even to the point u create an image for ur bias. It's definitely not all rosins there are chill ones but there's an overwhelming almost majority thatre like this so it drowns out normalcy

      <p>I get it but cmiiw there was soooome logic to it since the previously postponed fansa would've been postponed again? and it was technically 1 member vs 2. But I can't talk what upsets you upsets you I pulled away from the fandom at my worst and was a solo fan for a while but I moved on at least the fancon rlly helped but I was already lightening up before anyways to each their own hope u have fun at least😆

      <p>Diff anon but same i did so much last album i was streaming like crazy i bought albums i was putting in the work not because of anyone but for Hao but the company has been unfair to him. and this fandom is so disgusting to him i just can't even bother to care for the group anymore,  from the racism to the vilification of rosins and acting like we are demons and not taking anything about our bias seriously, just today zeroses were making fun of rosins and telling them to kiII themselves because they we are worried about his health but didn't say anything about other fans being worried about their favs, discrediting his position and saying he's not a main vocalist i was shocked how many zeroses were shading him, and this is not even the tip of the icerberg of how my fav has been treated, this pre-release was the final nail in the coffin with complete main vocalist and center erasure like i truly couldn't give less of a fuck about the group even if i tried and i hope this song flops even harder (if that's even possible).</p>

      <p>Nobody is making fun of you but genuinely I didn't even have a response cuz of how intense the paragraph was. I'm sorry if it's that serious you really should take a step away from the group and just stan culture in general this sounds like torture. And once again just because I don't agree or align doesn't mean there's a secret invalidating vendetta against you 😭 I explained how I see things and how a lot of situations are perpetuated. Like if it was as bad as u felt then most rosins would've unstanned and I said to compare the attitudes to the the other very large fandoms and there's a stark difference like being upset is a given but obviously for u it's more than being upset as a fan. But like I said to each their own everyone feels how they feel but don't start jumping narratives on to me this ain't twitter I wish u well on this pain stricken journey maybe you'll heal maybe you won't
