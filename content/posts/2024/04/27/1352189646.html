      <p>As a gunwook fan i don't understand why you're not getting rosins being concerned over hao's back during the choreo.. didnt your fav also suffer an injury during in bloom? like these things can get serious i expected yall out of everyone to not invalidate our concerns like the rest of the fandom does but oh well</p>

      <p>yea he did but what injury did hao sufferðŸ˜­? this started from people speculating him stumbling once and it was confirmed it was never a choreo issue like there's a difference between being sensitive and hao is definitely not in good condition but diagnosing him with chronic back pain when he doesn't have any is crazy. And girl literally shut the fuck up ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ anyone who says they're invalidated by the fandom is being  dumb on purpose because this started from an akgae war
