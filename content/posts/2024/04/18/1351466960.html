      <p>has anyone else noticed that the zb1 twitter account suddenly isnâ€™t verified anymore? ðŸ˜­ did wk1 stop paying the $10 subscription fee for Twitter Premium or did they lose it due to people buying bot likes or somethingâ€¦ I feel like it was still verified yesterday??

I didnâ€™t even realize it was their official account when their tweet showed up on my tl earlier since they changed the profile picture and there was no check mark so I just scrolled past it</p>
