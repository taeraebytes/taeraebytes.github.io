      <p>Some allins are funny accusing of rosins buying likes just because they are bot likes in the concept picture. This is twiter and everyone has bot likes if you scroll enough you'll see idk what they're on about hao when Mathew is right there with more engagements than their fave? Shouldn't they accuse seokryus as well then? Just stupid 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
