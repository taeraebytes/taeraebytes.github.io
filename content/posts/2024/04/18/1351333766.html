      <p>Today is the anniversary of the bp interim ranking being revealed ðŸ˜­ i remember being so mad gunwook wasnt shown but it motivated me to vote for him harder and thank god it all worked out in the endddd

I also thought for sure Park Hanbin would make it in the lineup 

Also remember Hanbin was P03 at the time that was crazyy. Mnet really wanted him to be the center by showing his rank, yet his fans still couldnt get him first place ðŸ’€ Sometimes i think about how Matthew was probably P02 

It also makes me even more amazed that a Zhang Hao, a foriegner, was able to get P01 without his rank being shown ðŸ˜­ like thats insane his win was iconic as fuck</p>
