      <p>Hao said that he could’ve done a better job than whoever was singing on that short sweat teaser audio. It’s fine he’s saying that tho right? He is the center of the group he can and should say stuff like that (I still have no idea who tf was singing in that teaser except ricky)</p>

      <p>Bruh this is so unserious I saw someone say it on Reddit during try to be an idol gate but zeroses are the only fandom where if a member can get criticized they search and grasp at straws to criticise OTHER MEMBERS instead of protecting the group🤦‍♀️ if what he said was a big his k fanaccs wouldn't be sharing it</p>

As of now most people giving us bad press are sm fandosms but instead of fighting them and God knows there's MATERIAL they'd rather drag their own members when that benefits no one but rival fandoms (case in point jiwoong fans post fuck scandal)</p>
