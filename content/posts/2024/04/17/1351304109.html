      <p>I donâ€™t think Hanbin is as evil as people think he is but I do believe heâ€™s extremely extremely repressed and has deep rooted insecurity. Whether consciously or subconsciously. Why? Because, and Iâ€™ll be completely honest, he was chubby growing up. Most people know that bigger people usually have the most friendly, happiest and positive personas because people disregard them due to their looks so they have to invest more time into their personalities. If they arenâ€™t benefitting from pretty or thin privilege then their personalities must either be incredibly funny and enjoyable to be around or super happy and friendly and positive. Hence why there are so many happy chubby stereotypes in media. Especially since he grew up in South Korea where being extremely thin is the beauty standard, it created even more societal pressure on him. I was big growing up so I understand him to a certain regard become more positive than the average person in hopes of getting more friends or being more likable since the looks werenâ€™t there. And this ties into my next point: by creating this super happy and caring persona he suffocated himself into a box and didnâ€™t learn how to properly express dissatisfaction or negative emotions. We can see that when he cried on that boat while in France (or was it Italy?) where Gyuvin hugged him for like an hour and he just sobbed. I think a lot of people are put off because his personality seems disingenuous but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s intentional, I just think heâ€™s never allowed himself or learned how to be any different in the pursuit of wanting to be liked and around others. Once he heals that insecurity and realize he doesnâ€™t have to be positive 99% of the time and can actually express negative emotions and not constantly behave like a kindergarten teacher then I think heâ€™ll seem more human and authentic. Like I said, heâ€™s not a bad guy, just insecure and repressed. I do think heâ€™s naturally sweet and shy but I wish heâ€™d be more comfortable displaying complex emotions and relaxing.</p>

      <p>Ok I don't think anyone thinks he's evil save for his antis but wow I agree I feel like his experiences growing up, his big change coupled with his leader role definitely put him into this suffocating box.

      <p>All the members have said stupid shit and yeah hanbin has been careless, it was a dumb thing to say especially several times but I think he was legit. just disappointed he didn't get to sing the song lol I don't even think he was trying to be shady ofc he's lucky he didn't get jumped cause if gunwook Matthew gyuvin or jiwoong said smthng like that they'd get jumped for a week but well that's not on him, he's been loosening up at least</p>
