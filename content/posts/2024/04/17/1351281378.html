      <p>that would have to do with his contract? Like you could buy a billion albums that's not gonna change anythingðŸ˜­???? and he probably did get more profit from lofficiel but that's also depending on their contract u guys need to think a little

      <p>How would you know who get the most profit I'd be surprised if he's not the most paid in zb1, if you meant that the higher ups get more money well yes kpop is ultraczpitalistic? Honestly he's probably very well off</p>

      <p>We don't that's the thing and I'm just assuming their contract details have the terms for their profit so outside factors will not change anything

      <p>Assuming they have the same contract terms as wanna one , Iâ€™m using them because their terms were made public, then the members all get the same cut. Cjenm get 25% wakone get 25% and then the boys get the remaining 50% split 9 ways. However wake one does not pay the members the money is paid to their original companies and then those companies pay the members based on their own contracts with them and things like trainee debt ect can change how much they get paid. I remember jisung i think was the most paid wanna one member because he didnâ€™t have a company he had to split his earning with.</p>
