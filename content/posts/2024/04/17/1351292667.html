      <p>Tbh the Zhbar probably put out that statement because they cannot buy as many albums as before. There are some new rules about shipping from Korea to China. A lot of Groups Cbars suffered from it. I think that Zhcbar is just ashamed to admit that fact and thatâ€™s why they put out that statement. If their numbers are lower than normally they can just say we "boycotted". Cfans love to surpass their past numbers, if they canâ€™t, things like these happen.</p>

      <p>Oh there's an issue with shipping now? This kind of does make sense because in the past even when rosins were mad they still bulk bought like the with the whole lofficiel thing and broke a record

      <p>Crosins dgaf about the group's sales anymore ðŸ˜­ they're fed up with wakeone and rightfully so the point of this statement is to let them know they'll stop blindly supporting the group while getting disrespected</p>

      <p>they're fed up i get that everyone is fed up it's not an exclusive thing tho. And I get the sentiment of not wanting to support the company but the lines become confusing since the product the company is managing is the very group we support its muddled but it's not even essentially a boycott and there's still a large chunk of fans thatll end up financially supporting

      <p>tbh would boycotts even help in their case? if this was any company i would understand but wk1 seems to give up on a group the minute they start selling less (see: to1 and kepler) so i don't think this would help the group in any way?</p>

      <p>i feel like wakeone has already given up on them though like the lack of care they give to this group even after selling millions of albums... this upcoming comeback already feels rushed. I was hoping crush's 2.1m albums sales could change things but they've come back and disappointed again the lack of quality in those teasers, this rollout is already messy and confusing. I don't think they are going to get the to1 or kep1er treatment. Zb1 is still a very popular group but things need to change.</p>

      <p>I feel like it's the opposite 2024 has already been leaps and bounds better than 2023 like idk how anyone can say wakeone has given up when genuinely this is the best it's been for them. yea the cb is rushed but I didn't expect them to become amazing overnight + this is not even close to the worst of what an actual rushed cb looks like we're fine. it seems like they're adding in things in as they go cuz they're realizing they can't half ass the cb it's definitely still rushed but u can tell the prerelease wasn't part of the original plan they're attempting to do smth new which I appreciate

      <p>wakeone is not abandoning them, kepler is disbanding soon and that only leaves zb1, until the new gg debuts and they see how that goes zb1 is number one priority with no second guesses</p>

      <p>The one thing I am interested though is this new gg is going to be permanent and under w1 so is there going to be more insentive for them to manage them better and do more for them or pull some of that zb1 money into preparing for their debut  because the millions of zb1 money gotta be going somewhere. Also what this means for zb1 in terms of priority and management because there contract will be at the halfway mark by the time iland 2 ends and if they have a similar timeline and debut near the years end only a year left of contract when the new gg debut.</p>

      <p>Well wakeone has had perm groups before and seeing as how they treat their biggest group so far you should have ur answer. They're capable of change if the gg does well enough and I think even while zb1 is active they'll continue to be the priority we just have to see
