      <p>Well me a hanbin biased person also don't want him to do high notes, pls wk1 gave him some actual lines and treat him as a main dancer instead of high notes, i really don't know what kind of vendetta they have against him, instead of giving him lines that fit his range they are giving him unnecessary high notes, give them to someone who wants them, i really don't think his throat conditions have gotten better since before crush. Also, I hate these allins who preach about him being the main vocal. Can't they see how this puts extra pressure on him, his vocal would improve more if wasn't forced to do high notes, i really hope he is taking care of his throat</p>

      <p>imagine how amazing the world would be if they made everyone sing in their ranges and I agree idky a main dancer is being given high notes? it's makes both things 10x more difficult to do

      <p>so funny how you only reply to "allins" who say bullshit about hanbin to fit your own hateful narrative lol absoltely no fan of him would ask for LESS lines and he is given those parts bc he's capable of them but no need to act technical and critical y'all hate him regardless. and yeah main dancers can be main vocals too. y'all just hate to see him be good at so many things</p>
