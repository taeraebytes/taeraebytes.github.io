      <p>bitch? See this is how I know you weren't there thrill ride was during their literal peak they were breaking records sales and chart wise they were getting put on really good promo I'm pretty sure this is when jukyu went on mmtg that was huge considering the show just started and they're from a small company. And this is when they officially surpassed txt in korea like omg don't ever thrill ride/maverick was the best time of our lives as deobis PLEASE TURN BACK TIME I WANNA GO BACK TO 2021 (minus kingdom)ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
