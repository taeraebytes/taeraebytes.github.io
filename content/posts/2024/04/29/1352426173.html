      <p>the poster is very obviously ai generated, I could feel something was wrong before I even looked at the details</p>

      <p>it's not obviously I'm the not the ai god but I'm good at spotting ai and I am a design student in college. The oooonly thing that I would consider calling ai is the desert but it's just very poor design it's very stock photo like. I zoomed into everything as well it's just the concept and heart of the design is so all over the place and they used odd texture. Actually I have class in 20 minutes I'll show the poster to my professor cuz I rlly don't think it's aiðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>diff anon, im a design student as well and i cant lie it looked ai asf but so far the only flaw i noticed is the cactus on the right. the tallest stem has 2 tips (?) on it, unless it was just perspective matter and there really was 2 stems overlapping each other</p>

      <p>Yea I noticed that too but the harder I looked it's a smaller stem in front of a bigger one. Like overall I could see why someone would think it's ai it lacks real direction but I showed my professor and she said it just looks messy with no concept and probably made w canva. We zoomed in and nothing looks weird in that ai way. like for ex illits highlight medley(?) art video was clocked for ai pretty quickly this gives me more ai created the idea and it was just made in canva

      <p>As an artist honestly it doesn't look ai generated to me? I'd have too look closer</p>
