      <p>can I ask where you've ever seen this happen in a title track? like yea sweat was a blind side but I cracked the code. they haven't been ACTIVELY pushing him for the past month or so I forgot he existed even everything now we're seeing is like a month post scandal and they're typically responsive so they're not doing it again #itookhopiumtoday
