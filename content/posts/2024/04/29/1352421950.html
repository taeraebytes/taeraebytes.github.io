      <p>it's not obviously I'm the not the ai god but I'm good at spotting ai and I am a design student in college. The oooonly thing that I would consider calling ai is the desert but it's just very poor design it's very stock photo like. I zoomed into everything as well it's just the concept and heart of the design is so all over the place and they used odd texture. Actually I have class in 20 minutes I'll show the poster to my professor cuz I rlly don't think it's aiðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
