      <p>Kep1ians piss me off. They complain so much about wakeone and then turn around and compare kep1er to zb1 and pray on zb1's downfall even though we're dealing with the same company.</p>

      <p>whyd my sisters try to argue with me on this ugh I got so irked. wakeone is a shit company were aware but I need people to be based in reality when they discuss the differences. no matter how shit you are you will invest more in a group that promises that much more of a profit compared to a group you managed that didnt stand a chance against competitors. wakeone had the same issue with the beginning of Kepler as zb1 they didn't find footing on what to do until it was too late (well music wise) Kepler have rlly good music but their first releases didn't reflect that and turned people away from them and it was too late by the time they found a nice sound. And I watched gp999 not as closely as bp but I could tell you right after finale this group was going nowhereðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I feel bad for Kepler thru my half dislike for them they rlly could've gone somehwere in a different timeline but gp999 didn't even garner that much attention to begin with it just wasn't gonna work. I hope their fans just learn to enjoy these past few months rather than get upset at everything zb1 do they'll regret it. AND PLEASE STOP PRAYING ON ZB1S DOWNFALL WERE DOWN ENOUHH PLEAEE PLEASE PLEASE ILL COMMIT LEAVE THEM ALONE NO MOREEEEEEE damnnnnn my bad meds kicked in I just have 10000x more to say now ðŸ˜­
