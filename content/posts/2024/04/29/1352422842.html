      <p>It’s definitely got to be a big schedule because there’s nothing like passport or visa issues like what’s happened in the past because it’s a domestic event. I’m just weird about this event though because the sponsor for the whole thing is Coca Cola which is probably why a lot of jyp artist are attending.</p>
