      <p>So I’ve been lurking the knetz, cnetz and jnetz  😮‍💨 and these are how (most) people feel about it:
Knetz: meh, it’s cute and the mv is good quality but it’s just meh 🫤 
Cnetz: people hate how disconnected the cowboy and tennis themes are in the mv, they prefer Sweat over it
Jnetz: it’s cute! They like it more than both the knetz and cnetz but it’s not like breathtaking

I’d say the most common theme of criticism from all of them (not from trolls or antis, but genuine criticism) is that the song is trying too hard to have its Fifty Fifty Cupid moment, it lacks unique vocals or synth highlights, and is too bland. I’d say about 1/3rd of people really don’t like the styling and confusing mv and I haven’t seen many people saying it’s amazing.

Imo I agree with most of the sentiment (outside the MV criticisms, I think the MV is nice). I feel like in response to the criticisms Crush got WakeOne swung too far back into the generic territory in order to be safe. But, the song sounds like something any group can do. It doesn’t highlight the group’s unique tones or skills. Sure it does sound like a ZB1 track but a b-side, not a title. I do hope it does have the viral sped up moment it was created for in order for the group to gain some more fans but I’m a little disappointed in the title track. The rest of the album is pretty good though and Hello is beautiful, I can see it having a viral moment when it’s performed live at a show.</p>

      <p>I'm nodding my head I'm nodding my head I can resonate with a lot of this and yea u can tell wakeone got too too safe but I can understand it. All in all my biggest thing was for the song and album to perform decently and for everyone to feel better. At least nobody's angry and I truly hope they can get their sound back next cb my expectations will definitely be higher
