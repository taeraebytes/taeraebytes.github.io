      <p>this will be my final rant and ill shut up

wakeone did everyfucking thing wrong. first of all do they not do background checks? why in the fuck would they get max of all ppl?!?!?!?!?!!?!!? a simple background check and theyll find out hes a racist sinophobic leeching piece of shit so some ppl gonna boycott regardless if the song is good or not. second jiwoongs scandal is not just a small scandal that shit was everyfucking where idgaf if they recorded the song months ago if wakeone really cared about the outcome they woulda re-recorded his lines with other members no matter how late also ai technology is so easy they coulda ai a members voice singing his lines and we wouldnt even know but they didnt they kept all his lines and made him the main focus in sweat and also got top three lines in feel the pop pissing everyone off.

ill acknowledge his screentime in feel the pop was less so wakeone probably realized from sweat that we do not want to see or hear jiwoong and they last minute edited his scenes out in feel the pop but its too fucking late, his voice is still shit and ruins every fucking song so the entire album is fucked.

k im done sorry queef</p>
