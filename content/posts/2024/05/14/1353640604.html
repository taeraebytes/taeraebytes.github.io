      <p>hm looking around on zerosetwt i think i-wdg kinda dumb like they all talk like hags and seemingly unaware of the reality like the audacity to demand more scrt and complain about it when heâ€™s in top 3 for line distribution ðŸ˜€ itâ€™s even funnier when i encountered some jw akgae like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ bruh what ur fav got hard carried by ot9 what yall not see? they berated someone for changing their bias from jw to hao (deserved ngl). and those mistreatment tags too? itâ€™s not like bro has a whole ass boring show and brand endorsement, itâ€™s not like wk1 tried to prove his innocence doing everything possible even directing it to other members? ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i rlly want to be neutral i think hating on a member that my bias is kinda close to (pls matthew, the interactions stiff as fuck ik u need that bag but pls god, i have secondhand embarassment the time he handed matt his mic) is pretty exhausting but fck i cant do this anymore lord 
itâ€™s kinda funny everytime his global fanbase/protect tells his fans to report the angddakjung comments on their socmed posts as if it aint your favâ€™s fault? sr for the rant this has been bottled up for a while i just need him and his fan to stfu for a while for my inner peace</p>
