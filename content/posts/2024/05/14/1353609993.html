      <p>I only follow a few kzeroses and they're just confused because wakeone isn't sharing much about the song itself and its just the same beat repeating itself. At first when they saw the cowboy concept they were worried it's going to be Crush 2.0 and were mad af because they wanted something like In Bloom and YuraYura then wakeone dropped sunshine concepts and they were happy and excited and then they dropped Eclipse concept and they were back to doom posting about it being Crush 2.0 but confused because the beat sound cute. 

Maybe this is a new pr strat wakeone is doing because no one knows how the song is gonna sound so you have no choice to tune it because it can go either way Crush 2.0 or In Bloom and Yura Yura' sister</p>

      <p>I kinda got concept that's fun. Aliens attack the Earth and turn the world into strange things and the boys act as rangers/cowboys I'm not sure about the desert tho but it's not out of place</p>
