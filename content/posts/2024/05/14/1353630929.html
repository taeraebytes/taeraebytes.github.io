      <p>I really donâ€™t understand how Gucci still wants JWs dumbass.. Get my boy in there instead. I read that they are GucciFriends of the House or something. I have no idea what it means but I know that I want my bias to be that instead of JW ðŸ™„ Iâ€™m sorry I really canâ€™t stand his ass.</p>
