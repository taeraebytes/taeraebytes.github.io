      <p>Fashion anon must be an oracle or something because Gucci sent woongsungz gifts from their cruise collection and their tags had #guccifriends so the might be friends of the house as of now. Which makes sense because that’s the closest they can get without the official ba role so they still have freedom with other brands. Also it must be serious if they were going to get invited to their cruise show in London had the comeback not fallen on the same day.</p>

      <p>I was shocked too 😂. I’m really suprised Gucci decided to keep working with him considering his imagine really is in the gutter and it’s not like he’s bringing much in over other members. Again this is speculation so please don’t take anything I say as what actually happened, but my guess is they said to the brand if you don’t work with jw anymore you can’t have hb. Now wakeone can’t force a brand that big to work with any of their artist they don’t have the power or connection for that, but they can say at this point “hey if your going to drop jw its not a good look and can damage his reputation and the group especially because it will be obvious why he was dropped since your still working with hb, so if you want to still work with hb you have to keep jw” obviously Gucci don’t have to agree and it would be very easy for them to move on and find a new idol they might want to sponsor but in my opinion they clearly still really wanted hb so were willing to still keep working with jw despite his reputation. It might also explain why hb was the only one at the ancora event but seeing how that made a lot of people speculate jw got dropped they possible said after that it’s either both or none. It’s interesting to see the friends of the house though, I wonder when that will be officially announced. Their recent global ambassador was a friend of the house for 1 year before he was ‘promoted’~ fashion anon</p>
