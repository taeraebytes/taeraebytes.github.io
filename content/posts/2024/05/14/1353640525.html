      <p>Fashion anon must be an oracle or something because Gucci sent woongsungz gifts from their cruise collection and their tags had #guccifriends so the might be friends of the house as of now. Which makes sense because that‚Äôs the closest they can get without the official ba role so they still have freedom with other brands. Also it must be serious if they were going to get invited to their cruise show in London had the comeback not fallen on the same day.</p>

      <p>I was shocked too üòÇ. I‚Äôm really suprised Gucci decided to keep working with him considering his imagine really is in the gutter and it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs bringing much in over other members. Again this is speculation so please don‚Äôt take anything I say as what actually happened, but my guess is they said to the brand if you don‚Äôt work with jw anymore you can‚Äôt have hb. Now wakeone can‚Äôt force a brand that big to work with any of their artist they don‚Äôt have the power or connection for that, but they can say at this point ‚Äúhey if your going to drop jw its not a good look and can damage his reputation and the group especially because it will be obvious why he was dropped since your still working with hb, so if you want to still work with hb you have to keep jw‚Äù obviously Gucci don‚Äôt have to agree and it would be very easy for them to move on and find a new idol they might want to sponsor but in my opinion they clearly still really wanted hb so were willing to still keep working with jw despite his reputation. It might also explain why hb was the only one at the ancora event but seeing how that made a lot of people speculate jw got dropped they possible said after that it‚Äôs either both or none. It‚Äôs interesting to see the friends of the house though, I wonder when that will be officially announced. Their recent global ambassador was a friend of the house for 1 year before he was ‚Äòpromoted‚Äô~ fashion anon</p>

      <p>I think before it was 50/50 to me because there‚Äôs loads of people they sponsor and invite to things that don‚Äôt amount to anything and I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it was so serious had they dropped jw post scandal but to keep him after his reputation is quite honestly one of the worst amongst 5th gen idols just to (imo) keep hanbin is very telling they want want a further relationship with him. I‚Äôd be very surprised if we didn‚Äôt get a BA announcement towards the end of the zb1 contract or soon after disbandment. Wakeone are lucky though that Gucci clearly wanted Hanbin bad enough because they could have fumbled it for the both of them and regardless of what people think word travels around between brand and had Gucci not thought Hanbin was worth it and dropped them both word easily could have been spread that wakeone is hard to work with or pulls these kinds of things and that would seriously turn brands away from working with any of the other boys too. I‚Äôve seen it happen before and suprisingly even though the brands are different these circles run closer that one would think and word travels quickly. ~ Fashion anon</p>
