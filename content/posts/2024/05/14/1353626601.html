      <p>I donâ€™t even hate jiwoong but Iâ€™m so confused as to how he ended up in top 3 for sweat and ftp. He quite literally has the worst voice / tone in the group ( yes imo even gyuvin is better) and Iâ€™m not saying other members donâ€™t deserve lines but nothing justifies him getting more lines over Hanbin or Taerae</p>

      <p>He has the worst tone by far and I've thought this since bp and I'll never understand even pre scandal he had no core fandom and failed to gain any kind of fandom like he's not profitable either or well liked by the public LIKE WHAT IS ITðŸ˜­
