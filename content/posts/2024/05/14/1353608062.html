      <p>The first one is so generic it could be anyone 
The second one is too vague like rejected from what?
The third one is also generic 
And I was kind of guessing hao for the last x just based off of vibes but it sounds like a recent thing? like this members been at qualms recently but idt it's Matthew either cuz it's one x per member maybe hanbin? Idk I have no idea it's a tarot reading this means nothing
what if it's gyuvin like he just seems out of itðŸ¤”

      <p>I donâ€™t think hanbin is the 2nd to last imo he was the spoiler one because heâ€™s given loads of spoilers for the cb that no one clicked onto until after the news dropped</p>
