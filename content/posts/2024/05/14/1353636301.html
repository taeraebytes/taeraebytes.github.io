      <p>This might make no sense but I genuinely feel like most people don’t recognize how hot Gyuvin is. Like yes he’s literally known as the “visual and proportions” member but I feel like his goofy ass personality and very, almost kid like styling from WakeOne (hats that don’t fit right, shorts that are too big, etc.) makes most people not realize it. It’s like his personality paired with the meh styling disarms people outside of his fandom (aka most zeroses and the public) from even thinking he could be attractive. It’s like a weird paradox where his personality is so Gyuvin-y you forget he’s hot. People will agree his height is tall and face small but that’s the extent of their feelings about him. Him bulking up made me realize that if he ever became serious, matured, and was styled maturely he would be incredibly handsome, like incredibly. And his personality will likely mellow out in the future (everyone’s does as they get older and experience more things) so I’m interested to see what happens to him.</p>
