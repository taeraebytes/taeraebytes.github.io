      <p>has been having so many arguments with his members, he has a hard time fitting in 

matthew? I mean bro is going through it with his status in zb1 and his old homie found new friends leaving him behind and maknae line are tight af so he doesnt really fit in either. I rewatched the anniversary video when they were all playing the party hat game trying to guess the polaroid he was standing off to the side alone while everyone else was messing with yujin and jiwoong. I wonder what happened</p>

      <p>unrelated but I always find it weird when other members are the one mentioning a member is going through something when the said member said nothing about it and now we have ppl speculating and overanalyze everything</p>

      <p>Usually only big mouth members do that for me it's 50/50 sometimes it's prompted in the comments and an obvious thing that they just confirm other times not so much and yea agree it can get so annoyingly speculative
