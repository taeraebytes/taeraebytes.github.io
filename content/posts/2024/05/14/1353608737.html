Our intl fanbase has grown a lot, we used to be not much compared to debut era. And promotions are yet to start so let's see. I also need wakeone to make a zb1 stationhead, that way I think a lot more people would stream on spotify and the boys can interact. And they should do the same with kchart streaming,  remember sweat streaming with the jebis had like 15k people? Yeah I need them now cuz rn its just 9k i think.",
