  tweeted that the ssng thing isnt true and they are making things up even if there is literal proof so it got ratioed by krosins asking op things like “how did u know is it because ur a ssng too” bc apparently its noir_hb’s alt account. qrts were full of ss too of noir joining a bbsngee space lol also krosins are mad bc allins are inserting themselves on hao’s ssng issue when krosins didnt even say anything about hanbin’s pluschat message even tho got antis to attack hao. its just a whole mess</p>
