      <p>itâ€™s kind of funny how solos or akgaes on here think that their bias wonâ€™t be flopping after the disbandment. all members will lose fans. some more than others. hao and hanbin will lose the most fans. most of their fans donâ€™t actually care about them as idols, they stan what they represent (being 1st/2nd, them being rivals, one being the center the other a leader). by my predictions hao will have it even worse than hanbin. thatâ€™s solely due to the fact that alot of his fans stan him for being the center of the group and wakeone actually making sure it stays that way no matter what. it pushes those fans egos up and makes them feel better about themselves. once that feelings is gone, those fans wonâ€™t stick around for longer</p>
