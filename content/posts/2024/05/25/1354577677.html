      <p>it’s kind of funny how solos or akgaes on here think that their bias won’t be flopping after the disbandment. all members will lose fans. some more than others. hao and hanbin will lose the most fans. most of their fans don’t actually care about them as idols, they stan what they represent (being 1st/2nd, them being rivals, one being the center the other a leader). by my predictions hao will have it even worse than hanbin. that’s solely due to the fact that alot of his fans stan him for being the center of the group and wakeone actually making sure it stays that way no matter what. it pushes those fans egos up and makes them feel better about themselves. once that feelings is gone, those fans won’t stick around for longer</p>

      <p>it's always the people who have the most nonsensical fans that suffer the most because these people come from token stanning

      <p>Tbh zeroses arent really stanning these men after 2026 too. We talk about akgae and solo a lot but the majority of fandom a lot of them like the whole group , which is why they dont really sway with these miniscandals akgaes poke at. Theyre already saying things like im not here after disbandment like damn y’all forgot these men careers will carry on😟 What i think will happen is they will stick with the
most popular product of zb1 which is most likely yuheua team or if there is a miracle and a new label wants to take on most zb1 members. If yuehuaz doesnt go to plan well its been a nice 2 years✌️</p>
