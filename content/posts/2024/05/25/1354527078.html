      <p>I mean there's nothing more to say hanbins just an extreme victim of his environment and it's not rlly gonna stop so long as their promoting ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but maybe I'm desensitized or smth im so used to hearing this from my previous groups ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ nct and even tbz used to get wicked about weight

      <p>ik he was trying to be funny but saying 'stop eating' like the nth time is just so annoying. And I understand why he behaves that way but like its starting to irk when you know how much of a food lover hao is and has expressed how he doesn't like when someone says to stop eating in his bubble live. And ik hao is a grown man who can tell him to stfu when it offends him but still it's just so annoying to watch. funnily hao said he was concerned about hanbin and asked to stop dieting very much just yesterday</p>

      <p>It's probably annoying to see and hear on a fans end but I'm sure it translates differently for them idk my advice is to just brace urself cuz I can see this being a reoccurring thing
