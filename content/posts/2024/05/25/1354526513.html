if these schizos in the comments are right does that mean wonyoung is actually 3/4 chinese taiwanese or even fully taiwanese chinese?!?!??!!? i dont know shit about politics and i know u have some sensitive anons so imma just say taiwanese chinese. 

dad 1/2 korean 1/2 taiwanese chinese or fully taiwanese chinese
mom is full taiwanese chinese but she naturalized so thats why her mom is considered 'fully' korean but her dad didnt naturalize and explains the wonyoung being 3/4 korean 1/4 taiwanese chinese rumor. So if her mom didn't naturalize she's actually 3/4 taiwanese chinese 1/4 korean or fully taiwanese chinese yall this is crazy

      <p>This rumors always been going around about her (but it's just that she's 1/4 Chinese/Taiwanese) and it came out of a place of malice there's never rlly been official or like solid rumors about it so I think she's mostly Korean if she is part Chinese she's definitely not fully or close to it it would've been very out and public if she was
