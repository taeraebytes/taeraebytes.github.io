they fucking rich so they dont gotta work so their life is lowkey pointless because everyone else need to school/ work in order to function in society so theyre just tryna find the one thing to keep them going. I noticed rich ass ppl are always obsessed with one thing because its the one thing they have to keep them going so they always turn extremely physco over it and being a sasaeng is something they can do and there's a thrill to it which keeps their boring rich life interesting.</p>

      <p>I believe in you!!!! but for that you rlly have to go back to learning the basics I took a drawing fundamentals class with a famous illustrator and he srsly drilled that into my head I just got ass cuz I stopped drawing consistently. But find YouTube videos where you basically do a bunch of fast paced exercises and life drawing it helps sooo much, heavy on life drawing there's no better learning tool than what's in front of you! and for perspective I was never rlly good but there's videos out there about 1/2/3 point perspective that would probably help
