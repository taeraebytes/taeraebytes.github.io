      <p>i remember that one tiktok of a fan who went to korea and said they didnt see or hear zb1 that much in there while they saw riize everywhere bc of advertisements and promotions like it really boils down to a good marketing team which zb1 doesnt have so the only thing they are known for in the gp rn is that they are a survival show group and jiwoongâ€™s group ðŸ˜­</p>
