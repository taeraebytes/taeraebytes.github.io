      <p>this is my personal opinion so don't jump me and i also ult hao and gunwookðŸ˜­ gunwook was really intimidating and scary in the first episode i liked him in star level test but wasn't interested in getting more into him because of that scary image and then i saw him crying during kill this love ngl it made my heart melt a little. but hao saying how sweet and cute gunwook actually is kinda sealed the deal for me from there on i haven't looked back. been stanning gunhao since that episode. hao's comments did have an impact on people but it wasn't the major or only reason gunwooks popularity increased, he became popula for being such a good performer and being insanely talented. you have to be crazy to credit hao for it</p>

      <p>BFBFNJDFJFEJJD?????? Wow some brown pomade and a concept will really spook y'all huh.. for me haos comment didn't change much and I also didn't notice a shift after people found gunwook cute before that episode it just came at a rlly good moment and just like u said you cant give any credit to hao when gunwooks popularity came from his talent ðŸ˜­
