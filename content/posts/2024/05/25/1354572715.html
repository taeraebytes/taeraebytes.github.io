      <p>If it was a diff member that said it i would probably be more annoyed. But bc its hanbin,,,, given his past and his deep insecurity we just had to roll our eyes and ignore bc its so obviously projection and hao is obviously skinner than him</p>

      <p>thats such a fucked up way of thinking. just because he had issues in the past it doesn't justify projecting his issues on to someone who also struggles with unhealthy dieting habits. hanbin was trying to be funny but he needs to understand the shit he says is rude and weird and he needs to tone it down. since he's super concious about his perfect boy persona i hope he notices the discussions surrounding this and stop making insensitive jokes like that</p>

      <p>unrelated but i was actually looking through zb1/boys planet ccs earlier and wowwwwwwww it was lit last year, now they've all disappeared and those ones are inactive. there's like no ccs.... all the haobin ones are dead and they were the closest ones to have tea or be gossipy like this one 😔 pretty sure all the ones that exist now are run by akgaes or just annoying ppl. thank u for all u do queef</p>
