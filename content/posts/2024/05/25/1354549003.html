 u can see where his natural lip line is which has always been fat af but then the mua's also overlip past his lipline with lipstick to make it look thicker/ plumper

and then this is him without the overlip makeup

the last two links was last week on the 17 & 19th and anons link was their sweat performance on the 16th so if he did get lip fillers it should stay extra plump but it didn't because its makeup. sorry I'm just tired of being accused of getting lip fillers myself so I'm defending ricky no matter what.</p>

      <p>the first no over lined lip link sent does look like filler (just in terms of how they look i donâ€™t pay attention to his face) and everyone gets filler before a cb so itâ€™s not wrong to assume he gets them filled. lip filler in korea is usually very subtle</p>
