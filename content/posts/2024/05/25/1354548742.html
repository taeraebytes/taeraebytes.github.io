      <p>bada and her crew signed under his company recently so i've wondered if they'll choreograph or work as his backup dancers. to me that also made it more obvious that he probably won't leave, even if he gets opportunity to, like i thought that might be possible before but now? nah (i could actually see members joining his company tbh - or maybe i just like the idea of members sticking together - but i guess we'll have to see how things progress with the members and their own companies towards the end of their contract). also i watched the video he did with bada that was filmed at the l1ve and she was pointing out that there were numbers placed on the dance practice room floor to keep track of things and hanbin was just like "what a great company" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
