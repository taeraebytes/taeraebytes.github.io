      <p>he's popular for a kpop idol in china and being the center I feel like a good chunk of his fanbase will leave once he's no longer the center

      <p>obviously they're solos but it's just a common trend with survival show groups and he gained a sizeable amt of fans for simply being the first foreign center I'm not saying it's a solidified future but it's likely

      <p>Yeah as a veteran more than half are going to leave unless he got a good contract with good projects coming up and that's borderline impossible if he goes to China, also Hao doesn't have a super idol like personality if he goes to China and gets more socmed freedom he WILL be beefing with fans</p>
