  tweeted that the ssng thing isnt true and they are making things up even if there is literal proof so it got ratioed by krosins asking op things like ‚Äúhow did u know is it because ur a ssng too‚Äù bc apparently its noir_hb‚Äôs alt account. qrts were full of ss too of noir joining a bbsngee space lol also krosins are mad bc allins are inserting themselves on hao‚Äôs ssng issue when krosins didnt even say anything about hanbin‚Äôs pluschat message even tho got antis to attack hao. its just a whole mess</p>
