      <p>deleted bc it got ratioed but an allindan (
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

  tweeted that the ssng thing isnt true and they are making things up even if there is literal proof so it got ratioed by krosins asking op things like “how did u know is it because ur a ssng too” bc apparently its noir_hb’s alt account. qrts were full of ss too of noir joining a bbsngee space lol also krosins are mad bc allins are inserting themselves on hao’s ssng issue when krosins didnt even say anything about hanbin’s pluschat message even tho got antis to attack hao. its just a whole mess</p>

      <p>lmao in her replies you can still see the post
…? 하오 배달받는거 나도 배달 와서 내려가서 음식받는다고 봤는데 아무일도 없었는데 중국온냐들 망상이 너무 심하시네.. 언니들 하오 지나갈때 폰들고 짱하어 짱하어 이지랄만 하셨잔아요 ㅋㅋ
...? Hao, I also saw that I was going to receive food when I came down for delivery, but nothing happened, but the delusion of Chinese people is so bad.. Sisters, when you pass by, you're doing it with your phone. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's just crazy.
idk how accurate the google trans is but ig she’s trying to say she was there too and nothing happened even though the saesang said it did? 😭 so ig she was stalking them on a different day or smth and outed herself??</p>
