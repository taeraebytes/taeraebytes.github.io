      <p>the saddest part is sweat’s greatness was downplayed bc its a pre-release, so ppl have greater expectations for the cb😭 its actually such a catchy song and it would be perfect for a summer release....</p>

      <p>Now that I think about it... Is Sweat supposed to be their title track until Max came and suggested another song which might "trend" and blow up in Tiktok, the reason why there's a fast version. But the members liked Sweat so they requested for it to be a pre-release so they can promote it like a title track in the hope that it will be more popular. I mean, it looks like the entire production team is more prepared for Sweat than FTP. Look at their stage fits. More efforts are exerted for Sweat than FTP, aside from the ugly cowboy. Even the concept photos and MV. Sweat was shot outside while FTP are just green screen and offices.</p>

      <p>No sweat was always gonna be a bside I feel like, they were choosing tts as they were hearing demos probably and I don't think max as the second producer has that much authority that's up to their a&r exec no? Even tho sweat was shot outside it obviously cost way less to make than ftp 😭😭😭😭
