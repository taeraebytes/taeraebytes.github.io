they fucking rich so they dont gotta work so their life is lowkey pointless because everyone else need to school/ work in order to function in society so theyre just tryna find the one thing to keep them going. I noticed rich ass ppl are always obsessed with one thing because its the one thing they have to keep them going so they always turn extremely physco over it and being a sasaeng is something they can do and there's a thrill to it which keeps their boring rich life interesting.</p>
