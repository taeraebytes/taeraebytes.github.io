      <p>i remember that one tiktok of a fan who went to korea and said they didnt see or hear zb1 that much in there while they saw riize everywhere bc of advertisements and promotions like it really boils down to a good marketing team which zb1 doesnt have so the only thing they are known for in the gp rn is that they are a survival show group and jiwoong’s group 😭</p>

But its defo the era of the girlgroups, last time I visted it was exo popularity peak and they literally were everywhere  SM works hard lol</p>

      <p>Wow that made me so sad and fucking mad like i saw someone tweeted what happened with gp towards zb1? it‘s just one song (crush) and then they proceeded to blame wk1 for using crush as title. NO BITCH YOU‘VE GOTTA ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM jiwoong was right there in front of you faking cute shit with his veneer and face full of fillers 💀💀💀💀 goddd i thought my hatred for him was tamed then i saw this discussion and my blood pressure spiked again 💀</p>

      <p>Inshallah i will pray Jiwoong does something unforgiveable in the eyes of international fans and everyone hates him and petitions him to leave and it works. Then we can at least have 6 months of Ot8 greatness and family without this evil presence🙏🙏🙏🤲🤲</p>
