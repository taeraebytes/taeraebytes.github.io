      <p>it will eat trust me the duality of good and bad magic
do we remember back when we thought they had Greek god lore, ugh I wish we went with that over whatever the hell we have now 
like we had dionysus ricky, eros matthew and demeter hanbin and then wakeone decided to pull the plug.. we could have had immortals/mortals duality</p>

      <p>Okay wait yes that eats but I was thinking of the magical girl concept aspect that's kinda like precure and dokidoki like hard pass 😅😅 but I rlly like this I also like their actual game concept too it rlly seemed like with in bloom era they were rlly gonna stick it down but they gave up and ftp was such a weak connection can they connect back to their roots.... like I would kill to work for free up in there whatre these ppl doing😑
