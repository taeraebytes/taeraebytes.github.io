      <p>if there was an attempt to put him in for commentary then I'm not sweating it. I found it cute that they added hao into the thumbnail and made him do pause commentary like they filmed content when he couldn't be there like filming schedules are pre planned and pre booked inconveniences happen and filming is rarely stopped like it's two yt vids I'd live sure I'd be salty but that's rlly it
