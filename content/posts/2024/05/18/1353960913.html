    "question": "i never saw the translation of haoâ€™s music show comment was he referring to the music bank they just performed at yesterday or during this comeback in general? bc if itâ€™s referring to not winning at yesterdayâ€™s iâ€™m like 99% sure itâ€™s basically impossible for groups to get nominated in the 1st week (i heard that bts did but that makes sense considering they were everywhere both korea and worldwide in 2018-19), someoneâ€™s gotta let him know thereâ€™s still a bit of hope ðŸ˜­ also if it was in relation to yesterdayâ€™s then i get why it was deleted bc not only could it be taken as against the fans but also against svt since they were the ones who won even tho iâ€™m sure he didnâ€™t mean for it to be taken that way ðŸ˜­",
    "reply": "Uhhhhh from what I saw (one translation) he sounded general about it? maybe he's just that scared but the person who posted the translation I saw I'm pretty sure is not fluent in Korean so idk some anons here are so they can say their piece if they saw"
