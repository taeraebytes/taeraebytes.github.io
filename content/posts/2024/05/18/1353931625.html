      <p>i really hope that the newjeans members and their parents wake up from whatever spell theyre under. min heejin is def getting kicked out of hybe. will they listen to mhj telling them nj is nothing without her or will they actually start thinking for themselves and realize they were being manipulated. saying things like "the members are exchangeable but im not" as a ceo is CRAZY</p>

      <p>but u have to consider what future they have after that like mhj at least has the intention to continue on with the group hybe is gonna set them on some long hiatus then disband them. It's not like their parents can rlly do anything on corporate level and if they let their kids fall under mhjs care oh sis they're not gonna wake up esp hyein with that stage momðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ if some third company could take them that would be nice but their only choice is mhj atp
