      <p>Rating of ZB1 OSTs according to floppery on charts
1. Luvluvluv. Tanked so bad when it's a duet of a former Izone main vocal and supposedly the most popular ZB1 member
2. MTE. Taeraes fans only focused on Genie and the streams from other platforms like YT are mostly from QoT fans who are streaming the OSTs.
3. I Wanna Know. Charted on melon, genie, bugs, circle, and instiz chart. Streams and ULs are decent.

I still believe that they should have released an OST where all members of ZB1 are involved, instead of having Hanbin sing alone. It was BND and Riize's strategy.</p>

      <p>Well hanbins did have the shortest time between announcement and release and for a less popular show dnnrngnrmmgmrkgm sorry it's a fact he was the most popular in korea at the time and he's still the most known by casuals but he's not the most popular now 

I wish they'd do a group ost too im rmbring the group one tbz did for that racket kdrama IT WAS SO GOOOOOOOOOD but seeing as how I never heard ab riizes or bnds not like it was effective
