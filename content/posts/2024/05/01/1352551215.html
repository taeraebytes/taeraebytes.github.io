      <p>Rating of ZB1 OSTs according to floppery on charts
1. Luvluvluv. Tanked so bad when it's a duet of a former Izone main vocal and supposedly the most popular ZB1 member
2. MTE. Taeraes fans only focused on Genie and the streams from other platforms like YT are mostly from QoT fans who are streaming the OSTs.
3. I Wanna Know. Charted on melon, genie, bugs, circle, and instiz chart. Streams and ULs are decent.

I still believe that they should have released an OST where all members of ZB1 are involved, instead of having Hanbin sing alone. It was BND and Riize's strategy.</p>
