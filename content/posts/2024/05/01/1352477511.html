      <p>you know i'm now re-evaluating all the things I saw as an army before. why does bts have such... philosophical concepts? I remember they even sold various philosophers' books like carl jung in either the weverse or bighit shop (this was a few years ago so I don't remember exactly when but it was after they released those love yourself the notes books) I used to think it was just world-building but what economical benefit does it really have?</p>
