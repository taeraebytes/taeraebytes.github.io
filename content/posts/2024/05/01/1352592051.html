      <p>as for jzerosetwt he trended more only member who was getting recognized by pedestrians reported some of the loudest cheers and his fans dominated at the fancons and the fansigns. That's not to say other members weren't getting it good but he was also selling out at in person stores like think what u want but try to come up on here and act like there's a definite 1 and 2 and there's a large gap. Gunwook has been reigning as the most popular in japan since the beginning of zb1 while hao has grown considerably you can't beat out consistent popularity just like that don't sit up in here and lieðŸ˜­
