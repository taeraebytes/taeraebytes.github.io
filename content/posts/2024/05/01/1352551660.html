      <p>I'm gonna ignore the smiling part bc like yeah it hurt that it seemed like they weren't also upset, but they're idols, what do you expect them to do? Plus do you think WK1 would allow them to look like they weren't on board with their decision?
The "ZB1 will ALWAYS be one" was shady bc WK1 had previously never acknowledged the existence of Always during In Bloom promotions and Hao wasn't even there. I can for the most part ignore the fancon except for the shady part about skipping Always in the online waiting room bc besides Hao it would have been a lot more work and it was a group thing. During promotions Hao only sang a few lines during radio shows and it was usually when other members brought it up.  From what I remember, those fan signs were the only ones where Always was played in the background (cmiiw). Not sure what solos/akgaes at the time expected bc I wasn‚Äôt tuned into them before the whole fansign debacle, but I thought like a video or something of Hao singing Always wasn‚Äôt that much to ask.
Like I used to get trying not to splinter the fandom (I was ot9 back then), so at first I wasn‚Äôt that upset by the lack of promotions. But then they decided to upheave everything by only giving Hanbin solo promotions and a lot were revealed during that period (ost, mcountdown MC, AAA MC), which made it even worse.
I‚Äôm over it now and should stop visiting your cc when that time gets brought up bc it was depressing, but it was really not as trivial as you guys make it out to be.</p>

      <p>so what are you nowü§î? And I get that 2023 was a shit time for me as well I pretty much stopped being a zerose but I'm over it. I get harassed on the daily ab the things that used to upset so those don't even phase me anymore lol I'm not saying it's trivial but since it's something even you could forget about then I don't think talking ab it is bad or anything. Like for me I just look back at that time and cringe cuz it was just a culmination of bad calls and neglect but we move like it's possible to see the positives simultaneously that's just me tho

      <p>(I‚Äôm assuming this got lost under all the asks about the asia tour and concept pic, otherwise I‚Äôll assume that you‚Äôre ignoring it for some reason)

I‚Äôm the anon that said that they were rosin-leaning and ot8 when I was talking about the whole Gunwook all-rounder and Hanbin main dancer thing. Like after that whole fan sign debacle I started seeking out akgaes and solos on twitter, but I mute them on the tl and keep them on a list to check into when things get bad and I feel like I just need an echo chamber. I don‚Äôt agree with everything they spew (eg the whole Hanbin choreo thing or calling out ‚Äúhaobinists‚Äù that seem more like allin akgaes pretending to be haobinists), but it‚Äôs nice to have a space where you feel like issues that you‚Äôre upset about are being heard. I do like other members and have been pretty good at blocking and not touching twts from akgaes of all subfandoms on twt, so honestly I can ignore a lot of the irrational toxicity rosin solos/akgaes bring up as it doesn‚Äôt really feel widespread. 

I‚Äôve been lurking here since dec? but I‚Äôve only replied a couple times because writing out paragraphs is exhausting and I know that if I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs gonna devolve into useless arguments. This space is nice bc gossip and it‚Äôs a space with differing views, even if they irk me at times. Like there‚Äôs general things that this space doesn‚Äôt remember or things that rosins have complained about that this space misremembers, but there‚Äôs things like the jiwoong stuff and stuff on the k/c side that aren‚Äôt talked about much, if at all, in other spaces I visit or have curated. Honestly the most toxicity I deal with is from this cc and Splatbin‚Äôs cc, but it‚Äôs the trade off for being able to hear outside my own curated bubble

I agree that 2023 was bad and I don‚Äôt think (I hope) that nothing is worse than that. This year has been better, but there‚Äôs always the worry about WK1 pushing other members over Hao especially bc it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll get a regular gig that can‚Äôt be given/taken at WK1‚Äôs whim. On the topic of being a zerose, I honestly tried to stop stanning them then and again when crosins were blamed for Hanbin‚Äôs trucks because I know that incidents that feel related to his race or the ethnicity of some of his fanbase are going to keep happening so long as ZB1 is under WK1 and the fandom has a lot of racists, but I was too obsessed by that point to stop. Of course it‚Äôs not bad to talk about it since it was a pretty pivotal event for fandom dynamics and it‚Äôll keep being brought up regardless when people accuse rosins of never being ot9, but a lot of people misremember what happened or why certain things were as bad as rosins say they were and it‚Äôs just not worth the effort to rehash the arguments of that era.</p>

      <p>Ok pewioddd curating ur space I fw that I fw that AND UH- NEGATIVE üòï? I mean I guess it gets irksome a lot but wow yea even if u didn't clarify what u discussed here before I probablt wouldve recognized not a lot of people write like u. I don't think it's that iiiii myself misremember if it's smth I was there to experience I don't think I do? but otherwise if I do it's smth I wasn't a part of or aware of but for me maybe it's cuz I don't share the same feelings of gravity. I had my own issues of stanning AND being a fan like I was getting lit up 24/7 ugh. But ultimately I try to understand what drives people to these outcomes and I've always been sympathetic or I try to be and I stated this previously I never once had an issue with rosin solos and they've always peacefully existed here. Since you e been here a while you've probably noticed my recent annoyance but before that all was well but this was just a little discussion ting and since I do see rosins who remain currently as zeroses I think it can bring perspective to some behaviors. Ngl I don't even know what I'm saying anymore but yea differing opinions a lot of ppl do misremember things get lost but eventually it circles back and I guess we're just bored af since nothings happening

      <p>"WK1 pushing other members over Hao" no shade to anon but i dont like how solos (from any sfs) think like this. imo other members are being promoted just like normal idols. But whenever they get schedules solos would always like omg theyre pushing xx. the same thing happens to taerae, im not even his fan but the ost is one of the few gigs he had since debut and they promote him as they should.. so hao not being promoted well as center ‚â† wakeones pushing other members</p>

      <p>Glad you said that since it gives me more words to write a reply and explain better. When I say pushing other members over Hao, I don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre getting opportunities that would for sure go to Hao. There are solo opportunities that I think Hao could get, but ultimately I can reason why other members might get it instead. I‚Äôll bring up 2 recent examples and you can judge where that puts me. 

For Taerae‚Äôs ost, I don‚Äôt believe Hao would have gotten a 2nd ost before Taerae got one. I actually expected the first ost to go to Hao or Taerae, with it more likely to be Taerae. We say constantly this on here, but Hanbin isn‚Äôt a main vocal, so I don‚Äôt know why he got an ost first and therefore I see that as pushing. Would I be upset if Hanbin ever got an ost? Maybe not, but it would probably depend on how I think they‚Äôre treating Hao in comparison at the time. Of the osts from groups I know, osts aren‚Äôt only for main vocalists, but I think they should & do get them first.

(I trust requeef will read this fully before she becomes upset) The other example is Gunwook mcing for Kcon Japan. Unlike Kcon Hong Kong where we had Chinese members that have an advantage in speaking the local language (cantonese, not mandarin), ZB1 doesn‚Äôt have any japanese members. The next consideration is Japanese speaking proficiency, but ignoring Jiwoong, I don't remember any member being significantly more fluent based off an instiz post I saw (can‚Äôt find it rn, but I don‚Äôt think what it said was super biased) & no way WK1 is going to push Jiwoong even more after the reactions to Sweat. Last consideration is popularity in Japan. Hao is the most popular and has his duo with Hanbin, while Gunwook is 2nd most popular, but ultimately Hao just mced for Kcon Hong Kong so I can accept it.

I‚Äôm running into the character limit in the next paragraph, so I‚Äôll add the second part after you post this</p>

      <p>Yea I would've expected hao or taerae for the first ost but hanbin also made sense in a way it's not like it was a shocking thing he got one first. And I think it's impressive 3 members got one within the same 12 months. As for gunwook special mc for japan the popularity thing between him and hao has always been up for debate and that aside while neither are Japanese or fluent gunwook is a much better speaker and suits mcing. He's always been their spokesperson so for that he makes more sense to me at least

      <p>Hanbin suits his ost for imo for two reasons, one the more heavy vocal part was sung by yuri and two it was a sweet, light type of ost, i feel hanbin's vocal suits this type of song more than hao and taerae, hao especially taerae's voice suits heavier types of songs, which in fact is not for hanbin's vocal tone</p>

      <p>Also want to add on that we would never know/agree if another member suits it better because you've already heard it with Hanbin's voice and see that as the original. It's not like Hanbin can't do his part. If another member did the same part and both versions came out at the same time, the most people could agree on is that they sound different. "Better" is subjective</p>

      <p>That's also true since hao and taerae would just adjust and adapt their voices but even if I heard an ai version or imagined it I'd still say hanbin cuz that's just me and I think his airy tone matches

      <p>Why are you arguing about who should get to sing Luvluvluv? 1st of all, CJ has a production team meant for OSTs. They have looots of OSTs. If CJ wanted Haorae to sing an OST first, they can just pick other songs that would suit their voices. CJ wanted Hanbin to have the 1st OST since it's a kinda promo for him as Mcountdown MC too & he's also the most popular in SK during that time. Unfortunately, the song flopped which I cannot fathom until this day...</p>

      <p>I think it flopped because it was released without any teasers or promotions + it was right in the middle of their debut when they had so many contents coming out</p>
