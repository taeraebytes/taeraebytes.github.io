      <p>ever since crush he started being weird about things. he probably thinks nobody is noticing. i have a whole list of things he did that were shady or just disrespectful. fame and fan opinions do get into some idols heads</p>

      <p>calling taerae monkey even tho crosins use that word to make fun of taerae

being more and more vocal about hating wakeone since he knows his fans love hating/shitting on wakeone. enables his fans even more to do the same.

hao always looking done or like he doesnt want to be there when the group is having group lives (they dont even have alot of group lives). i get being an introvert but this is your job, he is just putting the mood down for everybody.

being mean to whatever jw does or says in general. i dont like that guy either but cmon, he is your group member.

he can also never really compliment a member without making it about himself. "i like xys member because they like me" "i like that member because they are nice to me"

saying "why are you lying" to jaehyun when he was complimented hanbins looks. he (by now) must know that crosins make fun of hanbins weight/visuals

revealing whenever him and hb would have a fight, which resulted in hb mnet plus chat/bubble tag being flodded with hate. after that he stopped mentioning fighting with members tho.

hao saying he would do a better job than ricky for sweat.... which is still an insane thing to say till this day.

saying that ricky likes the song teaser since its his own part thats being revealed. sounds like hes projecting his own feelings onto the member. which tells me he likes or has the same thoughts as his solo fans. its normal to like something your voice is apart of but saying that he must be liking it just because of that... i dont know about that.

the newest thing is already being talked about. hao saying he is sad becauae he is at home while the other members have schedules. he knew exactly what he did with that.

im sure that there will be more i can add on here in the future</p>

      <p>Well I'm not the biggest rosin I'm actually one of the biggest rosin hater in this cc that gets hated on by rosisn but I'm anti parasocialism and stantwt craziness in general and this is also exactly that, it's a lot of psychoanalysis, projection on anon part or straight up misinformation:

Taerae was called a monkey as a term of endearment at first !

non issue, other members also hate W1 and actively push him to be a hater

Non issue, he just doesn't get hype in groups settings and that's fine, when he's next to a member he likes he's also more lively, like when he's next to Hanbin he usually jokes around and interacts more 
I also don't see how he spoils the mood? You have to be hyper focused on him cause I liked every group lives we got and want more

Jiwoong deserves and I hope he continues 🤷‍♀️I would stand on business and not even pretend I'm getting to know him like sungchan but more seriously he has been straight up mean to jiwoong only one time when he jokingly asked if he's drunk, jiwoong has been rude to him more and if were talking about him LOOKING like he doesn't like him well that includes a lot members too

thats also very much psychoanalysing and projection on your part like who cares first of all and just from memory I can remember several times that he complimented the members for being good looking or skilled at something without involving himself (yujin first ep of BP, has complimented hanbins dance, visuals etc a lot has said Matthew is cute bin is too nice etc)

Immediately after he was like I'm joking X3 bin is very handsome 🤦‍♀️in any other groups this wouldn't even be worth discussing wk haobin are very close obviously they're gonna joke around like this

No he said that they had a fight one (1) time on live and spent the next 10 min saying it's not a big deal and friends fight all the time? The only other times they've mentioned fighting is them both saying they had a big fight after the finale but that hao became a better person thanks to him 

Its a joke, I didn't like it either but given that literally no member including Ricky cared a little bit I don't think it's our place to judge whether it was ok to make, the members actually seem to prefer his humour when he's more blunt and crude 

This is straight up just psychoanalysis and projection and even if true..who cares?😭 I promise you a lot of idols will like their own parts the best or get excited at their part

Last thing already got debunked</p>
