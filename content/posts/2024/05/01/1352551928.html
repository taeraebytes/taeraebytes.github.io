      <p>I'm gonna ignore the smiling part bc like yeah it hurt that it seemed like they weren't also upset, but they're idols, what do you expect them to do? Plus do you think WK1 would allow them to look like they weren't on board with their decision?
The "ZB1 will ALWAYS be one" was shady bc WK1 had previously never acknowledged the existence of Always during In Bloom promotions and Hao wasn't even there. I can for the most part ignore the fancon except for the shady part about skipping Always in the online waiting room bc besides Hao it would have been a lot more work and it was a group thing. During promotions Hao only sang a few lines during radio shows and it was usually when other members brought it up.  From what I remember, those fan signs were the only ones where Always was played in the background (cmiiw). Not sure what solos/akgaes at the time expected bc I wasn‚Äôt tuned into them before the whole fansign debacle, but I thought like a video or something of Hao singing Always wasn‚Äôt that much to ask.
Like I used to get trying not to splinter the fandom (I was ot9 back then), so at first I wasn‚Äôt that upset by the lack of promotions. But then they decided to upheave everything by only giving Hanbin solo promotions and a lot were revealed during that period (ost, mcountdown MC, AAA MC), which made it even worse.
I‚Äôm over it now and should stop visiting your cc when that time gets brought up bc it was depressing, but it was really not as trivial as you guys make it out to be.</p>

      <p>so what are you nowü§î? And I get that 2023 was a shit time for me as well I pretty much stopped being a zerose but I'm over it. I get harassed on the daily ab the things that used to upset so those don't even phase me anymore lol I'm not saying it's trivial but since it's something even you could forget about then I don't think talking ab it is bad or anything. Like for me I just look back at that time and cringe cuz it was just a culmination of bad calls and neglect but we move like it's possible to see the positives simultaneously that's just me tho

      <p>(I‚Äôm assuming this got lost under all the asks about the asia tour and concept pic, otherwise I‚Äôll assume that you‚Äôre ignoring it for some reason)

I‚Äôm the anon that said that they were rosin-leaning and ot8 when I was talking about the whole Gunwook all-rounder and Hanbin main dancer thing. Like after that whole fan sign debacle I started seeking out akgaes and solos on twitter, but I mute them on the tl and keep them on a list to check into when things get bad and I feel like I just need an echo chamber. I don‚Äôt agree with everything they spew (eg the whole Hanbin choreo thing or calling out ‚Äúhaobinists‚Äù that seem more like allin akgaes pretending to be haobinists), but it‚Äôs nice to have a space where you feel like issues that you‚Äôre upset about are being heard. I do like other members and have been pretty good at blocking and not touching twts from akgaes of all subfandoms on twt, so honestly I can ignore a lot of the irrational toxicity rosin solos/akgaes bring up as it doesn‚Äôt really feel widespread. 

I‚Äôve been lurking here since dec? but I‚Äôve only replied a couple times because writing out paragraphs is exhausting and I know that if I don‚Äôt it‚Äôs gonna devolve into useless arguments. This space is nice bc gossip and it‚Äôs a space with differing views, even if they irk me at times. Like there‚Äôs general things that this space doesn‚Äôt remember or things that rosins have complained about that this space misremembers, but there‚Äôs things like the jiwoong stuff and stuff on the k/c side that aren‚Äôt talked about much, if at all, in other spaces I visit or have curated. Honestly the most toxicity I deal with is from this cc and Splatbin‚Äôs cc, but it‚Äôs the trade off for being able to hear outside my own curated bubble

I agree that 2023 was bad and I don‚Äôt think (I hope) that nothing is worse than that. This year has been better, but there‚Äôs always the worry about WK1 pushing other members over Hao especially bc it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll get a regular gig that can‚Äôt be given/taken at WK1‚Äôs whim. On the topic of being a zerose, I honestly tried to stop stanning them then and again when crosins were blamed for Hanbin‚Äôs trucks because I know that incidents that feel related to his race or the ethnicity of some of his fanbase are going to keep happening so long as ZB1 is under WK1 and the fandom has a lot of racists, but I was too obsessed by that point to stop. Of course it‚Äôs not bad to talk about it since it was a pretty pivotal event for fandom dynamics and it‚Äôll keep being brought up regardless when people accuse rosins of never being ot9, but a lot of people misremember what happened or why certain things were as bad as rosins say they were and it‚Äôs just not worth the effort to rehash the arguments of that era.</p>

      <p>Ok pewioddd curating ur space I fw that I fw that AND UH- NEGATIVE üòï? I mean I guess it gets irksome a lot but wow yea even if u didn't clarify what u discussed here before I probablt wouldve recognized not a lot of people write like u. I don't think it's that iiiii myself misremember if it's smth I was there to experience I don't think I do? but otherwise if I do it's smth I wasn't a part of or aware of but for me maybe it's cuz I don't share the same feelings of gravity. I had my own issues of stanning AND being a fan like I was getting lit up 24/7 ugh. But ultimately I try to understand what drives people to these outcomes and I've always been sympathetic or I try to be and I stated this previously I never once had an issue with rosin solos and they've always peacefully existed here. Since you e been here a while you've probably noticed my recent annoyance but before that all was well but this was just a little discussion ting and since I do see rosins who remain currently as zeroses I think it can bring perspective to some behaviors. Ngl I don't even know what I'm saying anymore but yea differing opinions a lot of ppl do misremember things get lost but eventually it circles back and I guess we're just bored af since nothings happening

      <p>"WK1 pushing other members over Hao" no shade to anon but i dont like how solos (from any sfs) think like this. imo other members are being promoted just like normal idols. But whenever they get schedules solos would always like omg theyre pushing xx. the same thing happens to taerae, im not even his fan but the ost is one of the few gigs he had since debut and they promote him as they should.. so hao not being promoted well as center ‚â† wakeones pushing other members</p>

      <p>Glad you said that since it gives me more words to write a reply and explain better. When I say pushing other members over Hao, I don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre getting opportunities that would for sure go to Hao. There are solo opportunities that I think Hao could get, but ultimately I can reason why other members might get it instead. I‚Äôll bring up 2 recent examples and you can judge where that puts me. 

For Taerae‚Äôs ost, I don‚Äôt believe Hao would have gotten a 2nd ost before Taerae got one. I actually expected the first ost to go to Hao or Taerae, with it more likely to be Taerae. We say constantly this on here, but Hanbin isn‚Äôt a main vocal, so I don‚Äôt know why he got an ost first and therefore I see that as pushing. Would I be upset if Hanbin ever got an ost? Maybe not, but it would probably depend on how I think they‚Äôre treating Hao in comparison at the time. Of the osts from groups I know, osts aren‚Äôt only for main vocalists, but I think they should & do get them first.

(I trust requeef will read this fully before she becomes upset) The other example is Gunwook mcing for Kcon Japan. Unlike Kcon Hong Kong where we had Chinese members that have an advantage in speaking the local language (cantonese, not mandarin), ZB1 doesn‚Äôt have any japanese members. The next consideration is Japanese speaking proficiency, but ignoring Jiwoong, I don't remember any member being significantly more fluent based off an instiz post I saw (can‚Äôt find it rn, but I don‚Äôt think what it said was super biased) & no way WK1 is going to push Jiwoong even more after the reactions to Sweat. Last consideration is popularity in Japan. Hao is the most popular and has his duo with Hanbin, while Gunwook is 2nd most popular, but ultimately Hao just mced for Kcon Hong Kong so I can accept it.

I‚Äôm running into the character limit in the next paragraph, so I‚Äôll add the second part after you post this</p>

      <p>Yea I would've expected hao or taerae for the first ost but hanbin also made sense in a way it's not like it was a shocking thing he got one first. And I think it's impressive 3 members got one within the same 12 months. As for gunwook special mc for japan the popularity thing between him and hao has always been up for debate and that aside while neither are Japanese or fluent gunwook is a much better speaker and suits mcing. He's always been their spokesperson so for that he makes more sense to me at least

      <p>(part 2)
This is tinhatty and maybe slightly irrational, so I‚Äôm open to reasoning and facts as to why I‚Äôm wrong, but I feel like WK1 is always trying to push Hanbin and Yujin to be more popular than Hao so that they can push them as center and receive less lash back. At the beginning it was more Hanbin since we had the whole ‚Äúduo centers‚Äù thing (I actually didn‚Äôt mind the duo centers thing till I realized how obnoxious allins were getting with it since they match well and it was nice for them to switch lines for NKotB; I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt do it for In Bloom bc the 1st line for the chorus was too high for Hanbin but idk) with them sharing the chorus and then strangely giving high notes to Hanbin even though he‚Äôs a lead vocal + the whole solo job stuff around debut. Since Crush they‚Äôve switched to Yujin since Hanbin gets a lot of pushback and people are nicer to Yujin since he‚Äôs young. Events that I see that affirm this are Yujin getting the starting line and ending center position of Crush, the fashion events he‚Äôs been allowed to go to, and the recent inkigayo mc position. Yujin being pushed as center isn‚Äôt as solid of a theory as Hanbin being pushed, so maybe I‚Äôll be disproven by the upcoming title track and promotions afterwards. It‚Äôs not so much that these jobs would go to Hao, it's that WK1 accepts offers for them and denies the offers Hao gets.

Perception is such an interesting thing. Popularity is hard to estimate (especially in Korea where any good indicators are easily affected by ifans), but one of its measurements is the number of solo schedules a member does get. In addition, solo schedules allow for exposure that usually goes to whoever gets the schedule. Think back to how Mnet showed all those Haobin posters during Kcon Hong Kong. To someone who doesn‚Äôt know of Hao‚Äôs cbar numbers compared to everyone else's', they would think that Hanbin is just as popular as Hao in China since they never showed the number of lightsticks rosins had specifically for Hao.

Still running into the character limit with the last paragraph, so I‚Äôll wait till you post this</p>

      <p>oh of course but I don't think it's necessarily to drown out haos popularity even if they tried it's just not going to happen the three of them are super solid in popularity domestically and kind of tap into different things. Hanbins always gonna be the sweet leader cj son marketed for the general public, hao is the most profitable and popular within in the fandom but even though he's been a breakthrough Chinese idol he's always going to be set back it's just how it is and yujin is the best for that crazy young kpop demographic and their real visual. That's just how I see it so it's not surprising that wakeone would promote them harder I understand that people expect hao the most but when there's other members with dominating popular it's inevitable it happens to ever group. Hanbin was most obviously shelved for a bit because it was 1 member with exposure vs the rest of the group at home if it wasn't like that wayyy less people would've been upset. And fashion/brand events are actually completely up to the people who invite them I'm sure company's have a little sway but it's almost a guarantee it's invite basis. I don't deny that yujin was nibbling the center plate cuz when crush was happening I was laughing so hard at that one person about rotating centers being kinda rightüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I personally don't mind it it's a waste not to tap into yujin he rlly has the best potential rn and brightest future. But I was justttt on the phone w jang about this it's true wakeone has denied offers for hao but realistically we don't know every gig that's been accepted or denied and over booking is a thing its not possible to do everything. 

Yea perception is strong but maybe it's cuz I'm soooo deep into this stuff that I feel like I can gauge popularity pretty well. but mnet has always highlighted those two and their chemi think back to the extreme haobin exposure and timeline on bp. I cant speak for casuals but I guess it would look that way if they had no previous knowledge of numbers and popularity in china

      <p>i feel like alot of yall dont realize that mnet LOVES haobin as a duo. those two kind of carried the show, of course they would emphasize the two together or use them to get promo for things. its how the industry works. haobin as a duo/ship reaches even non zb1 fans as far as kpop fans. mnet of course will delve into that, they are a business. nobody in those headquarters has a secret agenda, they are doing their work.

rosins and allins should be happy their faves get all these promomotions/schedules, even if its linked to the other, but they hate seeing these two together thats something i cant wrap my head around.

i also dont think that wakeone is trying to erase haos center position. if they wanted to, they would.</p>

      <p>Like nobody loves haobin more than mnet them showing the haobin lights didn't surprise me at all they die by that duo. And I agree I don't think they tried to erase hao as center they definitely could've had him go out like chaehyun if they wanted but they definitely wanted to have others in the spotlight at times which I mean every company does it's normal but it was so insanely stark at the beginning of zb1 

And fans hating the duo is inevitable also like this is prophetic p1 p2 beef üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ but also in their case haobin almost became the dominating identity over the two individually the amt of ppl that thought they were one person was insane and alot still do

      <p>diff anon I think regardless if mnet loves the duo or not og anon was talking about something specific which was them pushing hanbin more than hao at the beginning of the group's formation which was just nasty work that caused a mess in the fandom like if anyone deserved mnet's resources the most during debut it was hao because he had literally just won the show. And the point about kcon Hong Kong was real asfk i was shocked seeing the camera trying to focus on haobin kiss (?) signs and so obviously trying to avoid to show the massive difference in their individual banners so idk, it's good that hao had a strong fandom and brings in the most profit so they can't completely sabotage even if they wanted to but yeah</p>

      <p>no it's true I agree hanbins solo push while everything was silent was turrible but it's also just a fact mnet we're always so involved into turning haobin into what it is today but yea ig they were avoiding it I mean I get it why would they show 95 hao banners and 5 hanbin banners when they're both up thereüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ but yea I don't think they're trying to squash hao they would be obvious if they wanted to but it's almost impossible to at this point so
