      <p>I don't understand how anyone is saying Hao is more popular based on what? Hanbin still has the most searches on naver, Google Korea, YouTube Korea, and twitter is very simple to influence using Vpns and still hanbin trends higher or the same as Hao, hanbin is the only one who trends on kforums, just because y'all want hanbin to be less popular does not mean that it will happen.</p>
