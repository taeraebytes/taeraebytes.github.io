      <p>ever since crush he started being weird about things. he probably thinks nobody is noticing. i have a whole list of things he did that were shady or just disrespectful. fame and fan opinions do get into some idols heads</p>

      <p>calling taerae monkey even tho crosins use that word to make fun of taerae

being more and more vocal about hating wakeone since he knows his fans love hating/shitting on wakeone. enables his fans even more to do the same.

hao always looking done or like he doesnt want to be there when the group is having group lives (they dont even have alot of group lives). i get being an introvert but this is your job, he is just putting the mood down for everybody.

being mean to whatever jw does or says in general. i dont like that guy either but cmon, he is your group member.

he can also never really compliment a member without making it about himself. "i like xys member because they like me" "i like that member because they are nice to me"

saying "why are you lying" to jaehyun when he was complimented hanbins looks. he (by now) must know that crosins make fun of hanbins weight/visuals

revealing whenever him and hb would have a fight, which resulted in hb mnet plus chat/bubble tag being flodded with hate. after that he stopped mentioning fighting with members tho.

hao saying he would do a better job than ricky for sweat.... which is still an insane thing to say till this day.

saying that ricky likes the song teaser since its his own part thats being revealed. sounds like hes projecting his own feelings onto the member. which tells me he likes or has the same thoughts as his solo fans. its normal to like something your voice is apart of but saying that he must be liking it just because of that... i dont know about that.

the newest thing is already being talked about. hao saying he is sad becauae he is at home while the other members have schedules. he knew exactly what he did with that.

im sure that there will be more i can add on here in the future</p>
