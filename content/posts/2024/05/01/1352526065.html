      <p>I actually get annoyed when they do this like the only complaint Iâ€™ll accept was the mp dark photoshoot where they fucked his eyebrows but other than that you guys are basically just saying you find the other members pictures nicer to look at and thatâ€™s why you blame it on non issues for being bad</p>
