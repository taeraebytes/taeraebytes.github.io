      <p>apparently jimin's nevermind tattoo had nothing to do with the concept but bang pd met with an artist and stole her idea to make it part of their concept

      <p>She's been claiming it since a year or two too and since it's a female artist bang pd was getting sacked bad, unfortunately the cult thing made everyone forget about it but bts are actually getting massively criticized for the first time in years I can't link articles from pann but there's a lot about them</p>
