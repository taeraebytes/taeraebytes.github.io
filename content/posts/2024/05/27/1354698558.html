Also that gyuvin live where yujins pop exploded we heard yujin and ricky laughing while cleaning it up and if jiwoong was there as the eldest wouldn't we hear him? atleast to ask if everything is okay? or if they need help cleaning or even to scold them since hes the oldest?\n\n His fans are just stupid and choosing to ignore the obv facts because they dont want to accept that their beloved jiwoong aint that close with the members and fucked up all their idol careers.",
