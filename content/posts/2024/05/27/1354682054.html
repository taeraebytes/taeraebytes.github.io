      <p>itâ€™s kind of funny how solos or akgaes on here think that their bias wonâ€™t be flopping after the disbandment. all members will lose fans. some more than others. hao and hanbin will lose the most fans. most of their fans donâ€™t actually care about them as idols, they stan what they represent (being 1st/2nd, them being rivals, one being the center the other a leader). by my predictions hao will have it even worse than hanbin. thatâ€™s solely due to the fact that alot of his fans stan him for being the center of the group and wakeone actually making sure it stays that way no matter what. it pushes those fans egos up and makes them feel better about themselves. once that feelings is gone, those fans wonâ€™t stick around for longer</p>

      <p>Lmao most of zeroses wont last the waiting era while members are training for debut or signing contracts.ðŸ˜‚ But i do think that yuehuaz if they do become a group, will actually retain most of the zeroses for a short time. Its then up to yuehua if they give them good music and good promo. They can defo be on cravity level which is good enough to tour and have medium-nugu success in Korea. If luck strikes they can even get The boyz trajectory and be bigger in Korea. Its all up to luck and the concept that is trendy</p>
