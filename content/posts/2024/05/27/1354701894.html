      <p>he is fan bingbing's little bro (fbb was like THE top actress back then) anyways  he participated in the cn ver of produce and ranked 3rd. he's also from yuehua ent. after the produce group disbanded he was quite successful with his solo stuff in china and then shortly after he left yuehua. oh he was also part of the chinese equivalent of bive (but from yuehua) will the produce group was still on going but that groups a mess lol never heard about them ever since 2021 
idk if any jebes will follow that kind of path tho</p>
