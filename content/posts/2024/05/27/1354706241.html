      <p>I hate rosins and allins cause the fandom had been so united and strong recently and they always have to bring dumbass drama..why do you react with sm vitriol to someone acknowledging his mistakes omg🤦‍♀️and why are you bringing the saesaeng drama NOW instead of taking actions that could've led her to not getting into the fs more effectively 🤦‍♀️these people do not stand by anything or care about anything at all</p>

      <p>1M views on that post and hao even talking about it i think if wakeone dont want to get flamed they would not let that girl in esp that a lot of people knows her face already and they are not even fansites just regular girls so its easier to blacklist  🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
