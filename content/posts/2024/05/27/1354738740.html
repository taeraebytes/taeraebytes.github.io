      <p>I am sad that zb1 did not go to any university festival this year, this is all Jiwoong's fault, i am getting mad just thinking about this thing bc zb1 is enough popular in korea to get an invitation, but he ruined everythingÂ </p>

      <p>there are a bunch of smaller university that smaller idols perform at but the thing is , you have to be invited to go its never the other way around. Also they really dont like inviting boy groups. You have to be a rookie or extremely GP famous to go, theres too much hassle with regular boygroups and their fans Riize fans were getting a lot of criiticism for the way they acted recently in regards to camping. So smaller university opt to invite Stayc, Weeekly, billlie, woo!ah. Not boygroupsðŸ˜‚</p>
