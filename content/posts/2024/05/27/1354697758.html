      <p>itâ€™s kind of funny how solos or akgaes on here think that their bias wonâ€™t be flopping after the disbandment. all members will lose fans. some more than others. hao and hanbin will lose the most fans. most of their fans donâ€™t actually care about them as idols, they stan what they represent (being 1st/2nd, them being rivals, one being the center the other a leader). by my predictions hao will have it even worse than hanbin. thatâ€™s solely due to the fact that alot of his fans stan him for being the center of the group and wakeone actually making sure it stays that way no matter what. it pushes those fans egos up and makes them feel better about themselves. once that feelings is gone, those fans wonâ€™t stick around for longer</p>

      <p>yibo became that famous first bc of the untamed unexpected popularity, unless hao and ricky get on a drama that popular i dont see them having that much success over in china but anything is possible honestly but dont expect too much yall</p>

      <p>Also we won't see a danmei like this adapted for a while and hao can't get cast in a danmei for obvious reasons, but he'll also struggle in a het drama because of his accent 
Ricky I could see take the acting route but I doubt they will promote in China tbh his parents are millionaires (at least) living in the usa that usually means big scandal in the future if he stays in China</p>

      <p>i dont think hes ever going to act but if he did it wouldnt matter much bc almost all cdramas are dubbed so some voice actor would replace his voice. for example dylan wang has a heavy sichuan dialect so someone else always dubs his voice in his dramas while some other actors do their own dubbing after they get more experienced</p>
