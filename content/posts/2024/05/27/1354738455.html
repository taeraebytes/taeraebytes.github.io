      <p>hao replying to a comment that was like "i hope you and bin stay together" (or something like that idk it was already reported for being against community guidelines) and him being like "which bin" BRUH this timing is horrendous üò≠ get these men some media training please for the love of god they have to be aware of their akgaes... or do they do this shit on purpose and laugh about it</p>

      <p>the question was "will you date bin? or maybe you're already dating him" üò≠ the literal translation is different from the implied meaning you'd know if you're fluent in korean</p>
