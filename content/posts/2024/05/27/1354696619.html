The younger members redebuting in groups have a better chance at staying afloat than the older members just cuz ageing out is very real and hanbin would most likely redebut in a group alone where strength in numbers would be key. and I say dance/variety for hanbin because that's just what his company specializes in and since they're cj affiliated they can snag him jobs which would keep him afloat"
