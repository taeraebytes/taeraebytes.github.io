I don't even stan him but hes literally one of the funniest members which elevates our variety content and prob why we aint one of the boring groups because like queef said he bounces of the other members and the members bounces off of him. I mean I never would of imagine enjoying and laughing at two dudes and 3 girls having a competition but I did. \n\nhe isn't even my type visually but I'm so close to stanning because I really like his personality (I just have no time and energy rn for another member) and I think that's what ppl mean by 'push', just more variety content so ppl can see past his visuals because every time he shows himself like on his bday live/ kid show etc he gains more fans because theyre seeing more of his personality hence why so many of his bday clips are going viral not internationally but even in korean and japan where his fandom is prob the weakest because theyre finally seeing more of himself.",
    "reply": "smth was off w him in the winter but I feel like he's come out of himself in recent months and I said in a previous cc he seems more likened to idol life. But they're also not wrong about what he can be utilized in Ive always like Ricky's personality it's kinda why he's always been a top member for me but for variety appearances idt he should be by himself. I do have to agree with the weaker core fandom part also It's mostly seen that way just cuz of his insane volume of casuals that do not match up in the slightest I think his cores decent now but it rlly was small a few months ago. But like I said I don't think out of group variety is smth wakeone would invest in for him he's just not one of the top members you would think of but YouTube content/collabs/shows I think yea he could get a push"

      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed ðŸ˜”</p>

      <p>Yeah I'm not a Ricky Stan but he should be amongst the most pushed, he has the it factor they should let him do more English lives with gyuvin and Matthew and send him to variety shows</p>

      <p>I mean he kinda walked into the dungeon willingly he's the best for socmed marketing but he only posts things he rllllly likes I knew from the start he was never gonna be really active and idt he's well enough for variety so it's up to more self made content and a push that comes from his side to engage in posting more

      <p>sorry but like the only thing ricky is good at is social media engagements and his visuals that attract non fans, unfortunately he doesnt have variety content character and he (no offense) isnt that great of a singer/dancer plus he isnt the most passionate about being an idol so idk what people mean by push, he doesnt even attract core fans for himself (he goes viral for his looks but his core fandom is still small), so only thing i can think of is more social media presence, and maybe fashion gigs (?) but these are also by invitation so idk what will work for a guy like him</p>

      <p>That's all I can rlly think of as well I think what ppl want the "push" end goal to be is he gets big enough casually that he brings in fans but that's almost impossible for where we're at and even in his early days it didn't do much? but yea more for socmed and smth for fashion/modeling

      <p>? first im a gunhao stan but how can u say he's not passionate ðŸ˜­ members are always complaining about him singing all the time telling him to shut up at 3am and he's the only one that really puts effort when it comes to fashion how are we gonna ignore all that just because he doesn't like to talk about himself and doesn't post? so if you don't post about urself u have no passion?

idk if anon realizes because ur obviously not in his spaces but riyangis like him because of his personality i mean yeah his visuals attracted them at first but they stayed because of his personality which is discovered through his variety/ bts content so idk what u mean by small core fandom when i think he probably has one of the biggest core fandom internationally despite all his style changes. I don't even stan him but hes literally one of the funniest members which elevates our variety content and prob why we aint one of the boring groups because like queef said he bounces of the other members and the members bounces off of him. I mean I never would of imagine enjoying and laughing at two dudes and 3 girls having a competition but I did. 

he isn't even my type visually but I'm so close to stanning because I really like his personality (I just have no time and energy rn for another member) and I think that's what ppl mean by 'push', just more variety content so ppl can see past his visuals because every time he shows himself like on his bday live/ kid show etc he gains more fans because theyre seeing more of his personality hence why so many of his bday clips are going viral not internationally but even in korean and japan where his fandom is prob the weakest because theyre finally seeing more of himself.</p>
