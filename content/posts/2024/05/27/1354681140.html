they fucking rich so they dont gotta work so their life is lowkey pointless because everyone else need to school/ work in order to function in society so theyre just tryna find the one thing to keep them going. I noticed rich ass ppl are always obsessed with one thing because its the one thing they have to keep them going so they always turn extremely physco over it and being a sasaeng is something they can do and there's a thrill to it which keeps their boring rich life interesting.</p>

      <p>But like if the idol seem uncomfortable and everybody hates you how do you not feel shame😭? I really need to befriend one and get into their head like remember when that one Hanbin akgae followed him and watched him close his lights? what do you gain from that and how do you have the confidence to post about it</p>

      <p>obsession is a dangerous thing, ofc they're semi aware too but I feel like they just rationalize everything to feel better about it. Also the whole tier thing probably plays into how crazy they are cuz I'm sure some just like being in proximity while others have motives

      <p>yea most do but a lot of what we consider sasaengs isn't even the worst of it and usually dedicated fans that contribute to ex. Top fansites or just bored girls who like proximity they usually don't rlly hate those ones maybe the girls that are at everything but I'm sure to be a sasaeng that's smth you learn not to gaf about

      <p>Nah most idols def make it very obvious that they hate saesaengs but I don't think ssngs act like this FOR their idol usually they have a love hate relationship with them even</p>

      <p>I feel like usually the top fansites aren't necessarily the biggest saesaengs so they're bearable for the idol 
I will always remember that wanna one live where they said saesaengs are annoying but at least they're easy to sleep with 😭</p>

      <p>They're not I just said what ppl around us consider sasaengs like if I was rich and bored enough I'd probably be that and go to all their schedules even the private ones and get into fansigns and stuff maybe buy info like that's chill imo AND THEY SAID EHAT😭??????????

      <p>it was debunked lol and the rumor was it was said by sungwoon not guanlin, swing ent had a whole investigative team analyzing the audio and confirmed it wasn’t said at all (kinda similar to the jiwoong situation but i believe wannables conducted their own investigation too and came with the same conclusion cmiiw)</p>
