      <p>"girl you dont even know anything about cfans loyalty especially his fanbase ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and those fans he gained after winning the show stuck around till now despite wakeone so u dont even know what ur talking about"

Anon sorry to burst your bubble but Hao will lose the most fans. I know how Cfans can be, I also know how many of them token stan Kpop Group Centers. The actual normal Cfans stan Cactors or Csoloists. The ones that stan Kpop groups or Cgroups are looking for one common thing and that is the "Groups Center". The more said member gets pushed as Center the more fans they will get. This works well for the "Center" idols who are in groups that donâ€™t have an expiration date. Their Cfans will continue supporting them since they are the Center and deserve being treated like one by the Company. Zhang Haos case is different because he will not stay the Center. If he goes Solo in China he could still have alot of fans but if he stays in South Korea and decides to go solo alot of them will leave him. The same thing goes if he were to redebut in a Group. If he stays the Center he will keep most of his fans but if he isnâ€™t the Center anymore, fans will become new fans of the new Center. This is how actual Cfandoms work. Sorry that this is so long but I donâ€™t like seeing people act like they know how the CEntertainment industry works or how Cfandoms work.</p>

      <p>"Fans will become new fans of new center" lmao do you really think crosins will unstan hao and stan the members like yujin gyuvin and ricky?? If anything they'll just unstan and find other kpop group to stan, you have a point they will unstan if he choose to debut as a solo in korea but that's because they want him to focus in china not because he's not a center anymore please from where this center discourse come fromðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I think they meant cfans in general would become fans of the new center not necessarily rosins they would rather die than switch to yujin
