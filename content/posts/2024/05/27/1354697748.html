      <p>why do you keep saying Hanbin won't succeed either as a soloist or in a group like genuinely asking what are your arguments? not saying he could be next Taeyeon but he could absolutely achieve yena chungha eunbi woodz etc standard soloist success imo ðŸ¤” like you keep insisting on him dedicating to dancing or variety like why...?</p>

      <p>ur naming post produce soloists who came from groups zb1 cant even hold a candle to ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ in general every member is going to flop and going solo is a head first dive into flopping. The younger members redebuting in groups have a better chance at staying afloat than the older members just cuz ageing out is very real and hanbin would most likely redebut in a group alone where strength in numbers would be key. and I say dance/variety for hanbin because that's just what his company specializes in and since they're cj affiliated they can snag him jobs which would keep him afloat
