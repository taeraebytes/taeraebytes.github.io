      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed 😔</p>

      <p>Hanbin also trends a lot on pann with several posts gaining 50k+ views. The post about him attending his sisters graduation alone got 100k+ views and he doesn’t only trend in instiz, pann, he’s the most searched member on every Korean forum so..</p>

      <p>"he’s the most searched member on every Korean forum" clearly not on theqoo like ricky BEEN outdoing him since last year, and that trending with 50k or 100k views is literally a few times, i always see his chart account tweeting "pann 🔥 knets praise hanbin for x" and when i click on the article it barely cracks 5k or 10k views with 20 comments 😭😭 no offense but i've never even seen a fandom brag about instiz trending and i've been in kpop for years</p>
