      <p>I do believe that wonyoung has pretty strong Chinese ancestry that much is obvious not just by the evidences (father side of the family at least+never being first in the br list) but I find it funny that Korean are like super racist towards Chinese people but the features they desire and their standards of beauty is way easier to attain for a southern Chinese girl than a south Korean girl..if you don't want "foreigners to steal Koreans opportunities" try to highlight natural Korean women and their features a bit</p>

      <p>I think she has some descent too not cuz of the rumors she just always looked kinda Chinese to me but if she was truly anything more than a quarter we would know!!!!! And I noticed that as well the features so loved and regarded rn are more natural for Chinese women than Korean womenðŸ˜­

      <p>There were times she wasn't in the top 10 br list at all which is kinda ridiculous considering she's definitely the biggest and most marketable female idol currently</p>

      <p>we've had a debate about that before but the br list is ran by like one guy who will base it off of his personal feelings majority of the time jiwoong probably would've been #1 for February cuz of his scandal but he wasn'tðŸ˜­ also they have a history of purposely writing out idols from gwangju or lowering them
