they fucking rich so they dont gotta work so their life is lowkey pointless because everyone else need to school/ work in order to function in society so theyre just tryna find the one thing to keep them going. I noticed rich ass ppl are always obsessed with one thing because its the one thing they have to keep them going so they always turn extremely physco over it and being a sasaeng is something they can do and there's a thrill to it which keeps their boring rich life interesting.</p>

      <p>But like if the idol seem uncomfortable and everybody hates you how do you not feel shameðŸ˜­? I really need to befriend one and get into their head like remember when that one Hanbin akgae followed him and watched him close his lights? what do you gain from that and how do you have the confidence to post about it</p>

      <p>obsession is a dangerous thing, ofc they're semi aware too but I feel like they just rationalize everything to feel better about it. Also the whole tier thing probably plays into how crazy they are cuz I'm sure some just like being in proximity while others have motives

      <p>Yeah idk how much I can say cause I don't have their consent but the last thing I was updated on that was insane is there a weird company that several huge American celebrities invested in and the CEO that us written on the legal document claims that he's homeless and hes been drugged and force to be the ceo of that company, i think it was a crypto thing in the British government or something, wild stiff</p>

      <p>Toronto has huge trafficking rings it's just that human trafficking isn't what most people imagine it's not that you get kidnapped in a car and force to do sw you're usually groomed like you get an invite to a party at 14, start dancing in the VIP parts of clubs at 15 and being pimped out at 16 etc it's a slow process 
Everyone is siding out Baka because of Not Like Us but he's far from the only trafficker in Ovo</p>
