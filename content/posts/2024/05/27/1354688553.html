      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed ðŸ˜”</p>

      <p>Yeah I'm not a Ricky Stan but he should be amongst the most pushed, he has the it factor they should let him do more English lives with gyuvin and Matthew and send him to variety shows</p>

      <p>if he ever goes to variety show alone its better send him to bambams or yuqis or whoever funny foreign idol there. i dont expect him to be very funny at first but i think i would rather kill myself than seeing him receive racist comment.</p>
