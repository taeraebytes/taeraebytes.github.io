      <p>Probably not a popular opinion but don't you hate when idols (or shows) take recommendations for what they should cover and people suggest the latest iu song or some recent vocally not that challenging song they have semi covered in lives already!! Out of all the options ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Listen to cry for love and all I got his vocals go crazy there but I feel like UN village is very pleasing to the ears with no big sm high notes and should be attainable for our main and lead vocals</p>
