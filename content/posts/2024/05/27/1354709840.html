      <p>Aespa wayy more talented and likeable than bp but if we compare careers bp were way ahead of them just in their first year, their impact was crazy (and they+bts ruined a lot of things in kpop tbh)</p>

      <p>i have to disagree, aespa may be vocally talented but they could never command presence like blackpink were doing 4 years into their career. likeable? is debatable, but i dont really know about the members rlly going viral for solo things compared to blackpink</p>

      <p>I just cant stand bp anymore but it's true they had so much presence aespa simply don't have but I think winter has potential and it's crazy cuz majority of bps aura came solely from jenlisa we did not care ab jisoo or rose back then!!!!!!

      <p>Oh yeah I agree that BP had crazy charisma and presence on their debut immediately that aespa didn't have, but aespa are WAYYYYY better singers and honestly have actually been improving their stage présence, charisma and confidence a lot while bp members have degraded a lot</p>

      <p>singing isnt the most important thing in kpop, blackpink are more well rounded . lets be fair and compare blackpink 4 years in to aespa now 4 years in, bp have different circumstances which made them lazier. blackpink in the album era (hylt and lovesick girls) werent lacking at all and they were peaking performance wise. aespa is great but they cant do huge stages like blackpink</p>

      <p>and who in aespa is beating lisa in rap, dance or stage presence? surely not karina😭 i live aespa’s vocals but to downplay blackpinks skills is crazy they defo were not just lucky, if anything aespa are lucky with the fact they could barely give a good performance for two years and lipsycned the majority of their career</p>
