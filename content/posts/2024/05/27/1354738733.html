      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed ðŸ˜”</p>

      <p>He has great potential I want him to have better promos too and I think I can wish for gunwook to have the same in their next cb like it doesn't rlly matter I'm not gonna wait during the middle for things tk get good for him we don't have time and he's always had potential but agree we need a switch up I'm tired of this

      <p>i feel like the only barrier keeping ricky from getting that same push is his korean speaking skills like korean people love korean idols and if you can't be that you need to be really diligent about learning korean and make it known to everyone that you're seriously dedicated to it, that's part of why hao is so popular in korea. wakeone can do whatever to push him but it's also up to ricky to do the work and i don't think that's something he's really interested in or he would have been doing it already</p>

      <p>even though u donâ€™t actually need to study to learn a language like i woke up one day speaking english bc i was so used to consuming english content all the time it should be much easier for him bcs he lives there and has the opportunity to talk with other members all the time so why isnâ€™t he getting better</p>

      <p>NRNJFJEMFKKDKDMDðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ok that's not fair how come I didn't wake up speaking korean but also this would be Ricky's 3rd language and English and Korean are opposite in structure so his head probably gets mixed up a lot. but Ricky is not even bad for where he's at he's better than a lot of korean diaspora idols like felix STILL ISNT GOOD AT KOREANðŸ˜­ also korea has a lottt of English that would crutch him from learning and lowkey comparing English is unfair it's an international language
