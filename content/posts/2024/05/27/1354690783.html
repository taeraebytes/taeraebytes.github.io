      <p>i think it's basically their valentine's day but how would they know that the gift is for hanbin? it could be a last minute birthday gift for ricky since his birthday is on 520. or maybe he was buying a little treat for himself lmao</p>

      <p>He was seen carrying a loewe bag and today in a fs Hanbin said hao recently bought him loewe shoes, I have no idea if we can confirm whether it was taken on 520 or why it started spreading now I had never seen it before today might have been posted on xhs</p>
