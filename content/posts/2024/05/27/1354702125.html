      <p>ABSOLUTELY NOT. He has the skill for it but the scrutiny and pressure he'd face I'm all the way good

      <p>For gunwook it doesn't matter if he would be better or not he would get it worse no matter what he doesðŸ˜­ even as a regular member he walks on eggshells and still gets dragged. I think I would've killed myself if they picked him as the leader HES TOO YOUNG HED GET GRAY HAIRS AND BE A BAG OF BONES

      <p>you guys can talk about fan war fights and all that shit but hanbin has never done/said anything that gets the group dragged by the GP, even when he commented on that Hao post and agreed with it he didn't get dragged either. He had fulfilled the leader position pretty well, and the things other members have done aren't things that he can control.</p>
