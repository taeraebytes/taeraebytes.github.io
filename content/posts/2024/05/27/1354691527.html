      <p>I am sad that zb1 did not go to any university festival this year, this is all Jiwoong's fault, i am getting mad just thinking about this thing bc zb1 is enough popular in korea to get an invitation, but he ruined everythingÂ </p>

day 1: tws, gidle, aespa, illit, day6 
day 2: ive, riize, zico, itzy, ateez 

lowkey no idea how ateez got the invite they were prob only invited bc they went to coachella bc the crowd was dead silent during their set</p>
