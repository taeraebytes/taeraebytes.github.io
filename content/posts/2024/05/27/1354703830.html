      <p>why do you keep saying Hanbin won't succeed either as a soloist or in a group like genuinely asking what are your arguments? not saying he could be next Taeyeon but he could absolutely achieve yena chungha eunbi woodz etc standard soloist success imo ðŸ¤” like you keep insisting on him dedicating to dancing or variety like why...?</p>

      <p>ur naming post produce soloists who came from groups zb1 cant even hold a candle to ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ in general every member is going to flop and going solo is a head first dive into flopping. The younger members redebuting in groups have a better chance at staying afloat than the older members just cuz ageing out is very real and hanbin would most likely redebut in a group alone where strength in numbers would be key. and I say dance/variety for hanbin because that's just what his company specializes in and since they're cj affiliated they can snag him jobs which would keep him afloat

      <p>i need yâ€™all respectfully to stop bringing up woodz like the guy has been in the industry for years, and has always been known for being a all rounder and musical prodigy, hanbin just doesnt have that skills or even niche of doing rockðŸ˜­ and like reaueefiem said comparing zb1 to izone and ioi is just insane work</p>

      <p>mhm Yena isn't as skilled and yet her career have been better than woodz career opportunity wise. skills doesn't matter, good music and a good company push matter more. woodz skills only matter in this case bc he's the one producing his music, but if he had mid vocals and mid rapping but good music he would achieve the same. 

like idk maybe hanbin comes with some good producers and gag us a bit.</p>
