    "question": "Hmmm. About Ricky, he'll be more accepted in SK since he's presented as LA guy. He can organically trend in Kforums with real Knetz talking about him. Meanwhile, hao is a chinese gay guy who was living in China before Korea. Koreans would eat anything American. It's similar to how Koreans like African-Americans living in the US, but slander the Africans living in Africa when they're the same ethnicity. Different treatment to a Korean who came from other country like Matthew. He'll be treated almost simiral to Hao. Same situation in China where Ricky would have a hard time penetrating the market because he's Americanized. Chinese would be like, why would we give you money when your family left the country?",
    "reply": "this paragraph wow but yes he has an advantage"
