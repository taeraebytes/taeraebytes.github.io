      <p>not to be messy but i noticed that tweet about hao being stalked/harassed in belgium was posted very closely after hanbin addressed the stop eating thing which then caused rosins and allins to go schizo in hanbin and hao’s mnet comments. like in the screenshots u can see the original exposing of that sasaeng happened april 24th yet they’re spreading it now and yeah it’s terrible it happened but the timing is so suspicious like omg these girls know no rest</p>

      <p>yuppppppp and when i went in the qrts of the tweet when it was first making rounds someone said something like "and he kept this from us/didn't tell us/want to make a fuss" (probably getting it wrong) but IDK something about the way this was worded it just made me think "is this hanbin shade???????????" bc this was happening when hao/hanbin's mnet comments were blowing up with the most vile shit which stemmed from hanbin's message that was about drama concerning hao's fanbase (much like how the sasaeng thing is something to do with hao concerning hanbin's fanbase. u can argue about which is more serious or how it's not the same thing but idk it's both akgae shit). could be forgetting tho since that was last night and now it's the morning</p>

      <p>i'll be real it's been a while so i kinda dk what i was going on about either (and also what exactly ur asking) but

"and he kept this from us" -> rosins reacting to ssg who harassed zh
zh/hb's mnet comments blowing up -> happened bc of hb's mnet plus 'stop eating' message. zh was getting them bc allins felt hb didn't have to apologise and hb was apparently sent hate from them, hb was getting them bc rosins felt like he was setting up zh through his message or not addressing the situation the best? idk
how ssg thing relates to allins -> the ssg(s?) were allins and i think one was a haobinist who actually hated zh

but also i found out later that this ssg stuff was spread bc one of them planned to go to an upcoming fansign and then they did digging into their posts 🤷‍♀️ i still find the timing of it being posted to twt one hour within the hb mnet plus drama crazy but hey</p>
