      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed 😔</p>

      <p>Hanbin also trends a lot on pann with several posts gaining 50k+ views. The post about him attending his sisters graduation alone got 100k+ views and he doesn’t only trend in instiz, pann, he’s the most searched member on every Korean forum so..</p>

      <p>those 50k views are a rare occasion tho and it gets passed around on his intl fandom for views i really find it funny when they post the link on twt 😭 and i dont really get the most searched thing because theres an intl group dedicated for that and they are the only ones obsessed with it lols</p>

      <p>Intl clicks or searches actually do not count cause if it were counted hao would be on top considering he has a dedicated and bigger intl fandom</p>

      <p>anon what? they literally do count i'm crying you just stay on the page for a few minutes and refresh the article it does count on both pann and instiz... pretty sure a lot of people create/buy memberships too to comment but most i-rosins do not give that many fucks about kforum trending they're the same forums where he gets racist and homophobic remarks so most would rather not get into those spaces</p>

      <p>dont wanna start shit but ricky trending on theqoo multiple times in one week with positive results just debunked everything anon said... cuz to me anon is just giving excuses why hao isnt trending on those kforums because if ur interesting enough the dgaf about race i mean yeah there'd be a few comments but the overall majority will be positive.... idk just saying dkm</p>

      <p>I guess? I think it's more of a surprising thing to ppl that Ricky can trend despite ethnicity but also he just wasn't chosen as the target of Sinophobia but also Ricky is just trendier material than hao
