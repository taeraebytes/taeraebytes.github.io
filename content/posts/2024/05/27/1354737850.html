      <p>it’s really funny how stupid rosins can be jdhswgwgwytw to me it was obvious he was basically telling them to chill (not the first time this happened btw) but they just push the same narrative that they want</p>

      <p>I think that this was about the Hanbin issue and not the sasaeng one. Cause for the sasaeng one he already kinda thanked them for worrying. This time he seems kind of dumbfounded his 'fans' act like that towards members. That fan knew what they did when they asked him that. They probably thought Hao was gonna talk about another fight he had with Hanbin or something which would make things even WORSE. Thank god he didnt fall for that and actually called them out by saying "dont you know me"... Oh honey most of those people do not actually care about you, those people just want to hate</p>
