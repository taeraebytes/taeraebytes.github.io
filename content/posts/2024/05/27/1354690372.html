      <p>The hybe fiasco really did wonders to Aespa's comeback. Like, the GP loves them now despite of their nonGP music. Supernova happened to be good too and their CDp has been trending. Tsk! Aespa is about to be the top top 4th gen GG soon. It's not that embarassing to lose to them ü§£</p>

      <p>They are still bigger in the aspects that count with popularity like spotify streams, melon streams, PAKS. Nobody cares that people drool over Karina in china New jeans surpassed all the competition already, thats a fact‚úåÔ∏è</p>

      <p>Aespa wayy more talented and likeable than bp but if we compare careers bp were way ahead of them just in their first year, their impact was crazy (and they+bts ruined a lot of things in kpop tbh)</p>

      <p>i have to disagree, aespa may be vocally talented but they could never command presence like blackpink were doing 4 years into their career. likeable? is debatable, but i dont really know about the members rlly going viral for solo things compared to blackpink</p>

      <p>I just cant stand bp anymore but it's true they had so much presence aespa simply don't have but I think winter has potential and it's crazy cuz majority of bps aura came solely from jenlisa we did not care ab jisoo or rose back then!!!!!!

      <p>This grandma opinion but I think when it comes to stage presence no one can reach 2ne1s back in the day. Watching their stages even at the start of their career, it's crazy that it hasn't been replicated yet</p>
