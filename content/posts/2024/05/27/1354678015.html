if these schizos in the comments are right does that mean wonyoung is actually 3/4 chinese taiwanese or even fully taiwanese chinese?!?!??!!? i dont know shit about politics and i know u have some sensitive anons so imma just say taiwanese chinese. 

dad 1/2 korean 1/2 taiwanese chinese or fully taiwanese chinese
mom is full taiwanese chinese but she naturalized so thats why her mom is considered 'fully' korean but her dad didnt naturalize and explains the wonyoung being 3/4 korean 1/4 taiwanese chinese rumor. So if her mom didn't naturalize she's actually 3/4 taiwanese chinese 1/4 korean or fully taiwanese chinese yall this is crazy  

장원영은 혼혈이 아니에요 아버지는 대만화교 어머니도 대만화교에요 어머니 혼자만 귀화하셔서 국적을 한국으로 바꾼거뿐이에요 그러니 혼혈은 아니고 순수대만 혈통이지만 한국에서 태어난 한국인이이에요~</p>

      <p>This rumors always been going around about her (but it's just that she's 1/4 Chinese/Taiwanese) and it came out of a place of malice there's never rlly been official or like solid rumors about it so I think she's mostly Korean if she is part Chinese she's definitely not fully or close to it it would've been very out and public if she was

      <p>diff anon and shes half chn for sure I rmb seeing something on theqoo about her dad owning a chinese restaurant in seoul and knets dug up his facebook so they found out he studied in the states when he was younger, his facebook name was chinese and had chinese friends/ family which explains wonyoung living in the states for a bit and going to a english korean kindergarten in korea</p>

      <p>nope og anon got it mixed up, her mom is the one thats half but knets dont know if her mom is half or full chn but they know for sure she aint full korean because her mom naturalized so whether ethnically shes half chinese or not her moms nationality is korean but her father, grandfather and grandpa never naturalized even after living in korea for 2-3 generations so theyre still chinese and some knets are saying it's so they can avoid military service and keep their chinese identity. knets also found docs of her dad and grandpa being apart of some chinese korean association in korea to advocate for chinese rights living in korea such as voting etc.

oh and there was also this recent scandal that blew up with wonyoung she went on a show recently and was talking about the books shes currently reading and one of them was about Confucius wisdom or something and Confucius is of chinese origins so that was sussy</p>
