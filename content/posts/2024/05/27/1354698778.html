      <p>For gunwook it doesn't matter if he would be better or not he would get it worse no matter what he doesðŸ˜­ even as a regular member he walks on eggshells and still gets dragged. I think I would've killed myself if they picked him as the leader HES TOO YOUNG HED GET GRAY HAIRS AND BE A BAG OF BONES
