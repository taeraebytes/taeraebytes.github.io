      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed üòî</p>

      <p>Yeah I'm not a Ricky Stan but he should be amongst the most pushed, he has the it factor they should let him do more English lives with gyuvin and Matthew and send him to variety shows</p>

      <p>I mean he kinda walked into the dungeon willingly he's the best for socmed marketing but he only posts things he rllllly likes I knew from the start he was never gonna be really active and idt he's well enough for variety so it's up to more self made content and a push that comes from his side to engage in posting more

      <p>sorry but like the only thing ricky is good at is social media engagements and his visuals that attract non fans, unfortunately he doesnt have variety content character and he (no offense) isnt that great of a singer/dancer plus he isnt the most passionate about being an idol so idk what people mean by push, he doesnt even attract core fans for himself (he goes viral for his looks but his core fandom is still small), so only thing i can think of is more social media presence, and maybe fashion gigs (?) but these are also by invitation so idk what will work for a guy like him</p>

      <p>That's all I can rlly think of as well I think what ppl want the "push" end goal to be is he gets big enough casually that he brings in fans but that's almost impossible for where we're at and even in his early days it didn't do much? but yea more for socmed and smth for fashion/modeling
