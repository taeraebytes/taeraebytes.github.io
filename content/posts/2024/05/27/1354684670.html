      <p>I'm surprised he didn't because even Ricky went back to LA so it wasn't like it was a problem with their schedules or a problem with flight being too long because both LA and Vancouver are west coast so its prob 9-13 hours max. Even if it was for a few days just being in a familiar environment is so healing</p>

      <p>Ricky was only able to go because they already had tickets booked to la for krazy which got cancelled so the other members probably decided to just take an easy trip to the next door country for their break
