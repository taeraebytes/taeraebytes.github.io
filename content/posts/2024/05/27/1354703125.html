      <p>no I was being a creep trying to understand their dorm layout and only saw two doors in the hall way. think of it like a box with four rooms like this

12
34

1 is the living room
2 is the kitchen (living and kitchen is open concept no wall separating those two 'rooms')
3 is room 1 with a bathroom inside the room
4 is room 2 with a bathroom inside the room

in between 3 and 4 is the hall way with bedroom doors on each side 
and i think the entry is on the wall between the kitchen and living room only logical sense. The managers prob live in another dorm and have a key to their dorms cuz the dorm itself looked way to small and we all seen their rooms theres only two beds in both rooms, mattew and yujin bunk beds, gyuvin and ricky one bed on each side so no extra bed for jiwoong or manager</p>
