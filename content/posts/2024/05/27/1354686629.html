      <p>members that will lose the most fans after zb1

1. hao and hanbin - like anons said it's true that a lot of their fanbase stans them because one used to be n1 during bp and a leader and the other one is a center , 1st chinese to win a survival show etc. their entire entire image built on being number 1 and "better than others" hence why their fans take so much pride in comparing them to other members and constantly re-establishing their superiority. but once we take out other members out of equation, or the haobin rivalry, they doesn't have anything special. for lot of these fans it's not abt them but abt being a fan of, what they perceive, best most popular member
2. yujin - many of his fans stan him simply because he's a maknae and will unstan him once he grows up. also he's bland asf and if it wasn't for wakeone doing active effort to make him stand out in their content, he would be unnoticed
3. gyuvin, matthew - both of their images are dependent on they relationship with other members, esp gyuvin. and matthew is riding that chronically english speaking member archetype so hard. he will be b.m 2.0
WALL
4. gunwook - I have seen people say they stan him only because of his image as the ace of the group
5. ricky, jiwoong, taerae - most people who weren't true fans have already unstanned them due to scandals, image change, broken expectations etc</p>

      <p>Agree a lot of why ppl can never wrap their head around why certain ppl act out this bad is cuz they actually don't care!

I saw gunwooks noona fandom exit in real time same will happen to yujin unfortunately ðŸ˜­ but his visuals are strong enough to keep majority around imo 

PLEASE NO I SEE IT COMING BUT I CANT HAVE MATTHEW BE THAT BASTARD ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and gyuvins fandom has already left by large what's left will probably stay since they're bonded to him but he'll still shed a good amount due to inactivity 

Yea the price of talent fans but he'll also keep majority his fandom is genuinely trauma bonded to him it's crazy 

Well yea jiwoong no fans and the other two are for casuals so

      <p>this ended up being way longer than i meant to write but what do people think 

agree on hao and hanbin. hao will still have a strong core fandom but it is going to be a drastic change no matter what. if he stays with yuehua he will do a lot in china and his fame could rise again, but if he is serious enough about staying in korea he might find another company. hanbin will mid out maybe get a rise later on but i only see him debuting solo and i don't think it will go that well. he could get more casuals interested in him if he does variety and mcing stuff, personally i hope to see him follow a chungha path even if it isn't as successful. yujin i have a lot more opinions on i won't dive into but i do agree he will lose a lot of his fans who like him for the image he has now. depending on what he does he could get a lot more though.
gyuvin matthew agree. if gyuvin ends up in yuehua bg with yujin he will do better but if that doesn't pan out i can't see him doing anything but a nugu bg, modeling or acting. matthew is the biggest question mark for me because i think he would flop as a solo artist in korea and would fit a group better but i don't know what group is there for him. i hate to say it but i also can see him becoming bm 2.0 or even someone like eric nam with a podcast talking to other english speaking idols. maybe ending up in that crowd..... please matty no you need to be better than that. i think gunwook will lose the noona fans like you said but a lot of his core fandom will stick around wherever he redebuts, while i think he is most fit for a solo career as he can do everything i don't know how successful it would be. he would be great in a group as the ace again but i don't know what group he could be in. 
for jiwoong he does have like three fans on the kside but he still has his intl fans it depends on what he does after how many will leave. the hag fujos following him from his BL days will follow him for life tbh and some of them are rich. i think taerae will lose most of the casual fans he has but his core fandom won't change much, there are less of them but i think those that have stuck around will follow him pretty much wherever even if he's a nugu solo or with wakeonez. if he becomes a ballad guy or something he could get more casuals into him again because the GP likes ballads. ricky will do fine whatever he does he will always have attention for his aura alone but i don't know how his core fandom will hold up kinda like jiwoong it will depend what he does, i wonder if yuehua would include him in the bg or if they even have plans for him at all.</p>

      <p>yuehuas plan for hao and what he wants conflict and figuring that out will probably put him on some kind of hiatus which is bad for his fandom 

I guess hanbin going solo makes sense but it's so obvious he won't do well so if his company rlly cares they should ditch that idea and if they do a group centered around him I don't rlly see it having success either his best bet is going back to dancing and entering host/variety

yujin I just weirdly see doing well he just has good luck 

I only see gyuvin getting into acting when he's older he's just too childish and probably not good at it and modeling I don't think he'd get far he rlly should just redebut imo maybe he can be a bit like cravity or below them idk 

Matthews only shot is a group debut like deadass..

oh gunwook already lost his noona fans well they're still a good 50% of his fandom but those ones will stay they're obsessed with him and also his fans went through his year long hate train I think he might retain his fandom the most out of everyone. And I think he fits being a solo artist but he doesn't want that at all and I wanna see him in a group he can go solo in 7 years
Jiwoong please just get a civil job and go to the military then get married or smrh

      <p>Hao is a question mark, I honestly don't see him staying with yuehia unless he has an excellent contract and no other offers

I actually think Hanbin will be in a group, his company has been seeking boys around his age and not as young as other companies are searching (then again that might be due to the lack of male trainees in general)

Gyuvin is toooo loyal to yuehua I'll be shocked to see him leave but then again he's super ADHD lol I also see Ricky staying, I think yujin could have a better offer but idk I'm betting on him staying still 

I don't see Matthew staying as a kpop idol,  or jiwoong obviously 

Gunrae redebut in a group in their respective companies for sure</p>

      <p>I think hanbin could be in a group but that's not gonna be the best route for him I think Ricky won't redebut gyuvin and yujin most likely tgthr I feel like yujin would do his best outside of yh but they like him enough matthew is gonna stay a kpop idol he doesn't have any other prospects taerae post wakeonez we know that and I'd rather shoot myself in the head than gunwook redebut with jelpi but he probably will sigh...
