      <p>matthew is a sneaky lil bitch cause why is he always chosing dance tiktoks that benefits his own dance style ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ he probably learns the dances a day or two before filming them with the other member too. he fell off HARD when it comes to dancing to zb1 songs. he is barely clinging onto that 3rd best dancer title. with yujin close behind. this comeback will make or break him.</p>
