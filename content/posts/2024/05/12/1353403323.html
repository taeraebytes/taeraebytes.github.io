      <p>If Matthew wasn‚Äôt an idol he‚Äôd be such a good f*ckboy, and not the toxic frat boy ones but the progressive, left leaning ones that have emotional intelligence so they can easily make emotional connections but that‚Äôs almost worse because he‚Äôd actively choose to break hearts understanding the weight of his actions but proceed to surrender to his own selfish pleasure and ruin people‚Äôs lives.</p>

      <p>Dorks always be slinging the most dick, why do you think nerds always have the biggest body count, do polyamory, and are swingers? They‚Äôre just more socially correct fuckboys ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Also that‚Äôs why bandkids fuck and interbred like rabbits</p>
