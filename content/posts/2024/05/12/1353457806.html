      <p>New drake tea: I'm listening to an audio from Kendricks friend and he said a lot of people in the industry started disliking drake after he went after Pharell and that all the Kendrick tracks we've heard so far were from one session and only the surface of what he has to say, he also says that it's true that umg wants to stop the beef and that ovo asked him 150k for Kendrick dirtðŸ‘€</p>
