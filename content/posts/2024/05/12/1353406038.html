      <p>the way anon sent in a tweet of a known akgae (jjangdriod) and is acting like their word is absolute baffles me ðŸ˜‚

they were throwing around balls and interacting with fans hence why some of them missed to sing their part or were late to sing it.

hao and taerae are singers that sing in a loud voice by default. you cannot compare them to yujin who just started getting confident about his voice or gunwook who thought to stick to the backtracks volume.

the membets had time and knew that the song was going to be put in the background while they interact with fans. they already performed this song once, the second time was solely go interact with the fans and maybe sing here and there.

if you want to drag zb1 get a lil more creative next time.</p>

      <p>LIKE DONT SEND THAT BRUDDA IN HEREðŸ˜‚ 

like no one is gonna miss their lines on purpose ðŸ˜­??
and yea like this was a big step for yujin anyways he used to choose not to sing period and gunwook sounded fine just quiet like?

right right that's why hao wasn't even singing the whole time he was trying to talk to the fans on mic like I'm not rlly sure why everyone cares so much it was supposed to be cute and fun ending for the audience
