      <p>If Matthew wasn’t an idol he’d be such a good f*ckboy, and not the toxic frat boy ones but the progressive, left leaning ones that have emotional intelligence so they can easily make emotional connections but that’s almost worse because he’d actively choose to break hearts understanding the weight of his actions but proceed to surrender to his own selfish pleasure and ruin people’s lives.</p>

      <p>Dorks always be slinging the most dick, why do you think nerds always have the biggest body count, do polyamory, and are swingers? They’re just more socially correct fuckboys 🤷‍♀️  Also that’s why bandkids fuck and interbred like rabbits</p>

      <p>JFJNFNFNNDNDNDNNDNS ok that's like a minority of dorks most aren't like that but Matthew would probably only have like 3 bodies
