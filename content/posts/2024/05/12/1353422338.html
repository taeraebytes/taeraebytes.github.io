      <p>Thereâ€™s a tea account mainly focused on female idols and according to them haechan and ryujin are nasty, both have poor hygiene, they rarely took showers when lived togetherðŸ¤®. They probably donâ€™t even brush their teeth, Haechan said he had 9 ulcers in his mouth. their relationship was toxic, he treated her like shit even when they broke up and ryu was dating another guy she was still visiting him. Ryujin canâ€™t stay single, all her bfs are male idols, when she starts dating she completely loses herself in men. Her current bf is rumoured to be I.n., heâ€™s a fatphobic bully, he made all types of fatphobic remarks about changbin but skz members and fans are too busy babying him and ignore his disgusting behaviour.</p>

      <p>I mean that account also makes things bigger than they are they said that she was smoking some vape  with nicotine that equates to 1 pack of cigs but when you search for the vape the one who looks the most similar to hers only has 3% of nicotine. and it makes me cackle bc they act like ryujin is the antichrist but their fave is karina who is always all up ryujin ass</p>

      <p>they have a whole cc dedicated to discussing her so yeah ðŸ˜­ like i can agree with some of their points like her being careless about being spotted at nct dorms and also the way that her fans exaggerate her dancing talent but there's a bunch of things that get exaggerated over there just to make things bigger like they were also saying that she was posting those feet pics to be complacent to the male gaze and all that bullshit when they are just judging that shit from their western perspective like the whole feet fetishist movement isn't something big in korea and that's why you see those idols posting feet pics 24/7 without any issue. and even if you dislike her acting like she's the antichrist when you have your fave even saying that they thank for the fact that ryujin was born, it's kinda crazy.</p>
