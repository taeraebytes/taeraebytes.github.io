      <p>i think theres like. huge gap in terms of proximity between hyung line and maknae line

jiwoong - doesnt fw anyone and vice versa, trying so hard to give the impression of madmakz duo but failed (miserably at that)
hao - only close with hanbin gyuvin
hanbin - only close with hao gyuvin matthew. good thing he cares about gunwook yujin ricky
taerae - only close with matthew because of same age. evnne at most huh
matthew - only close with hanbin gunwook thank god he can get along pretty well
ricky - girllll its clear hes only friends with maknae line ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­its always painfully awkward seeing him interacting w hyungline esp when wakeone tries to push minamz agenda STOP
gyuvin - almost close with everyone except jiwoong and taerae and matthew
gunwook - closest w gunwook and gyuvin. nice try simping on ricky tho hes indeed cute
yujin - this kid really *smh* hes no longer that close w gyuvin but good thing he gets along well with ricky. theyre neurodivergent rep of the group</p>
