      <p>?? Heya is literally always top 3 on melon wdym no noise ðŸ˜­ (unless anon talking about internationally then idk I'm on ktwt more)

Yea the visuals were nice but there were also some controversy on the Chinese side with the whole copying Chinese culture stuff but I'm not knowledgeable about it so ill just stop here. 

I don't know about the other members because idrc about them tbh but Wonyoung been going viral every day with her 'Lucky Vicky' mindset (someone QRT'd Jiwoongs ssibal comment and got like 20k likes or something and it was pretty recent too so I fear that ssibal is going to stick with him the rest of his life ðŸ’€). She also went on the Psick show and been blowing up on ktwt too. Queen is thriving and that's all that matters ðŸ’… Not good news but this also made noise, Wonyoung got a pretty serious death threat a few days ago and it was serious enough Starship intervened and got the police involved, I hope the popo gets their ass.</p>
