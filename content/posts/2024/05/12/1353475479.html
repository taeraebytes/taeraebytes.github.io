      <p>i think theres like. huge gap in terms of proximity between hyung line and maknae line

jiwoong - doesnt fw anyone and vice versa, trying so hard to give the impression of madmakz duo but failed (miserably at that)
hao - only close with hanbin gyuvin
hanbin - only close with hao gyuvin matthew. good thing he cares about gunwook yujin ricky
taerae - only close with matthew because of same age. evnne at most huh
matthew - only close with hanbin gunwook thank god he can get along pretty well
ricky - girllll its clear hes only friends with maknae line ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­its always painfully awkward seeing him interacting w hyungline esp when wakeone tries to push minamz agenda STOP
gyuvin - almost close with everyone except jiwoong and taerae and matthew
gunwook - closest w gunwook and gyuvin. nice try simping on ricky tho hes indeed cute
yujin - this kid really *smh* hes no longer that close w gyuvin but good thing he gets along well with ricky. theyre neurodivergent rep of the group</p>

      <p>I wonder why yujin and gyuvin become so distant, wanting them to interact, you can literally feel they are not as close as before, what did gyuvin do?</p>

      <p>I think they've kinda grown out of each other all I hear now is about how they clash they're still gonna have that closeness but it's not what it used to be ig + they played it up for votes in bp

      <p>theyâ€™re literally kids itâ€™s normal for their feelings and emotions towards things to change as they grow older and form opinions, yujinâ€™s literally a teenager that wants to grow up so bad and those kinds of ppl stick by their opinions a lot (so if heâ€™s had a certain thought about gv during this puberty period itâ€™s probably gonna stick way harder) + yujinâ€™s too mellow for gyuvinâ€™s too hyper. itâ€™s rly not that strange or hard to figure out why they got distant like iâ€™m sure if uâ€™re a shipper uâ€™d be sad but this is actually a really natural thing to happen among pubescent teens</p>
