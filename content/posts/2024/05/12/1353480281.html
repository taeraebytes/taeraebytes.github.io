      <p>Melon always edits groups like this.... they cut out whoever was in the middle so they can split the group into two, one on top of the other. Also I don't understand why it's such a big deal it's just a small banner😭 spamming tag lines to a poorly worked melon intern who is unaware of the situation isn't going to do anything but agitate urselves further</p>
