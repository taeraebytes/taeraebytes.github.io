      <p>nobody is saying anything towards intl riyangis calling for an actual boycott of zb1 merch and shit but when rosins or allins were dissatisfied about the mv screentime, they were getting thrown bricks at them ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ is it like this because those two have the power to actully do some damage or what? cuz people are being hypocritical rn. the same people who were bashing people for not streaming sweat are saying people should boycott the actual comeback</p>

      <p>The contrasts are funny but it's two things riyangis obviously don't have the numbers like rosallins and their fandom does not have crash out akgaes by the masses and are typically group fans so while yes they're annoying they don't piss people off they're just slow
