      <p>New drake tea: I'm listening to an audio from Kendricks friend and he said a lot of people in the industry started disliking drake after he went after Pharell and that all the Kendrick tracks we've heard so far were from one session and only the surface of what he has to say, he also says that it's true that umg wants to stop the beef and that ovo asked him 150k for Kendrick dirtðŸ‘€</p>

      <p>According to a Kendrick affiliate it's OVO XO (the weeknd) beef, makes sense since both are based in Canada, the timeline is:
2021: Abel and Drake make up after a lot of signing, women drama
2023: Drake takes shots at Abel in FOATD
2024: -The Weeknd heavily involved in the two fuck drake alvums
-The Weeknds Manager house got shot
-Kendrick Vs Drake beef all week
-In one of Kendricks song he says "Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak"..."Have you ever thought that OVO was working for me?" Cash is Abels manager, he's saying it's not him leaking the infos
-Afer Drake pretty much lost, his house got shot 3 times</p>
