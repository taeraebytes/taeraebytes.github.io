      <p>Sharing the reading bcs I was surprised when I read it I cant imagine being the mattbin fan who requested itðŸ˜­:
How does Hanbin view the relationship?
Knight of Cups H, Three of Cups R, Ten of Wands, Knight of Cups R

He definitely doesn't think they are friends. This relationship is like a burden to him; it stresses him a lot. 
And he doesn't think it's a successful relationship. 
He feels good sometimes, but with all the other cards, I'd say that most of the time, he doesn't feel good.
How does Matthew view the relationship?
Page of Swords R, Three of Swords R, Nine of Cups

He thinks it's okay. There isn't the feeling of "yeah we friends" but it's more of a "yeah, we know each other, and there isn't anything else. That's totally okay."
Matthew also thinks that there is a lot of rudness and sarcasm surrounding this relationship. 
Like he knows they aren't close, and I do get the feeling that there was some gossiping, insulting at the start. However, he got over it and, like I said, thinks that things are okay now.</p>
