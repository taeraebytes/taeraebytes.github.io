      <p>these r just a few things off the top of my head but 
1. a fan sent her w pride phone case as a gift and she used it for and also posted a pic with it. her biggest fb rted a post where someone said it was a pride phone case and within a few days she changed it 
2. she sat on a rainbow pride bench (i think it had some historic significance for the queer community in that country but im not certain) and posted pictures with it but put a b&w filter over it so you couldnâ€™t see the rainbow. 
3. she just talks like a femcel also not related but sheâ€™s also stinky asf sheâ€™s admitted to not washing her hair</p>
