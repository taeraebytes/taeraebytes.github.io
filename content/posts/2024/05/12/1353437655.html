Ricky is the funniest for me during their variety shows, but he has different persona without a camera rolling. Gyuvin, Hao, Matthew & Taerae are the dgaf type of funny. They're similar on & off cam. Yujin is funnier off cam, but the weird type. Gunwook's ass is too smart for dumb people to laugh. I think, if you make a Gunwook, Hao & Gyuvin show, you will get the nerd society laughing of their jokes. Hanbin is that one friend who isn't funny, but he laughs a lot and gives best reaction on everyone's joke so you still want him around",
