      <p>he's obviously mean behind the camera interactions I feel like he's homesick + tired + problems with his own fans etc both gunwook and hanbin are the ones who mentioned that he feels lonely lately</p>

      <p>the way he had to go to hanbin and ask him why he wasn't paying attention to him as before. like the shippers are also annoying but let's not be dumb, it must be sick to see hanbin being all up gyuvin and zhang hao ass when he was supposed to be your best friend like i would actually be sick</p>
