      <p>I watched some fancams from yesterday and yeah the k gp does not like jiwoong AT ALL dead silence when his part comes on and I'm worried because their cheers in general weren't as loud as before (comparing to bof)... I really hope it was just the cams not picking up the cheers because I'm actually gonna cry if their reputation as zb1 is ruined because of him</p>
