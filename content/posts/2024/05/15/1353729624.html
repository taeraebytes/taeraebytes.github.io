      <p>I was just discussing zb1s socmed team w my friends and it goes so deep like wow were rlly fucked INSTA TIKTOK AND YT SHORTS ARE SO IMPORTANT UGHHHHH they need to just abandon twt too but I wish they'd quit the stupid challenges picked by staff and make the acc completely member owned they probably won't get it right the first time but they'd do trendy fan requests
