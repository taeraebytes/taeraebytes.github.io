    "question": "I fear that Hanbinâ€™s generic kind personality is starting to get annoying. Like even tho Hao can get a little entitled and insert himself when he doesnâ€™t need to, at least he has super funny moments and can joke around and make fun of himself. But Hanbin is soâ€¦ one dimensional? Itâ€™s like, showcase something else that just that Princess Diana smile and softness. Be actually angry for once PLEASE. Even Jiwoong, god rest his career, can be funny in an uncomfortable unc way. I get Hanbin is super repressed and probably doing this constructed personality out of his own choice but tap into your old roots please. Even half of the personality he had during his waacking days would be amazing ðŸ˜­ as more time goes on it feels more and more fake, at least the extent of it does",
