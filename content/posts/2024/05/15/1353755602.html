      <p>it isn’t about the hair only, it is about outfits etc., which ngl they have a right, cause why are they dressing him like a toddler, yes he is the shortest member but that does not mean you can only dress him as a child with the same john cena shorts 

afaik they want to send two trucks, one for their demands and companints, e.g. styling, schedules, promo and the other is with positive messages for matthew</p>
