      <p>Based on what Hao just said I wonder how much the members know about Jiwoong scandal affecting the group... I hate to think that they blame themselves for the outcome</p>

      <p>for them we have to consider they actually have a relationship towards jiwoong it's definitely a weird disconnected one since he has no presence in the group and spends his time apart from them but they're probably somewhat aware they're probably on his side about it OR they're fed a delusion that his scandal isn't responsible for the outcome and that's why they've been so down in the dumps cuz they think it's their fault
