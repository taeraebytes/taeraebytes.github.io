      <p>it cracks me up how quick ppl believe pann full of trolls and hao/zb1 antis op knew what she was doing posting it before cb the article flopped bad no evidence and even if it was true thereâ€™s no way they are dating they wouldnâ€™t eat out in the public if they were so this means they are just friends who are not afraid to hang out publicly cause there is nothing to hide</p>
