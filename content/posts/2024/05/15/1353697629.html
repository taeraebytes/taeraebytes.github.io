      <p>ok but why are riyangis saying that ricky has no schedules, he's got the hello82 thing and now this npop thing.. like that's 2 when most members have 1 or in jiwoong's case 0 (unless i'm missing some schedules?), and that's pretty good. if they're expecting solo shit sorry that's just probably not gonna happen and the more members doing stuff together, the better like we already have enough solo stan problems as it is. not saying ricky's being treated well bc obviously not, same goes for all members in varying aspects, but like let's at least be factual in our complaints</p>

      <p>they think if the world isn't bowing to Ricky then everything else doesn't count and he's being abused and tortured
