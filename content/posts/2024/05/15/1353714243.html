      <p>It's been awhile since I came on your cc and I'm sorry I don't know if you want to hear this because it's not good news, I'm more active on the Korean side than international side and sadly our reputation is completely ruined because of Jiwoong's scandal and a big chunk of the fandom left for other groups. Who wants to stan a group that's always the punching bag from the Korean public? 

I'll compare us to Riize because similar situations happened, although they were hit with one scandal after another they were ultimately debunked, Seunghan, Antons girlfriend, Eunseok Theonly etc. and if it wasn't debunked SM still handled the situation. For Eunseok, his scandal was debunked but still left a lot of speculations so SM handled it by pushing him to the back where he isn't visible for their latest comeback and they put Seunghan on hiatus. Whereas for us Wakeone tried to debunk Jiwoong's scandal but it only led to more speculation even involving other members and that caused internal conflict between Korean zeroses because they do not want their bias to associate themselves with Jiwoong because whoever he interacts with will undeniably be hit with hate by the Korean public but Wakeone keeps pushing duos/ trios despite this. Also not only did the Dispatch article led to more speculations which led to even more hate Wakeone never provided a follow up leaving the speculation up in the air when everyone already knew Jiwoong did swear further angering the public. Netizens already know he did so why not just make him apologize? How hard is it? See the difference between SM and Wakeone? At least for SM there was an answer even if they didn't like it they could at least close the chapter and move on but Wakeone did the exact opposite leaving the door open for speculation and hate and despite all this they continued to push Jiwoong instead of hiding him. That was the last straw for Korean zeroses, it showed them that Wakeone does not care about the reputation of the group or the members who are innocent in all this.

Some of the fandom left because of this, time is short why stan a group the company obviously do not care for and treat them as an atm? A lot of zeroses are students so school is already stressful enough imagine them going home after a long studying day only to see trolls and hate posts about their group when they can stan another group with a positive environment and is liked by the public. Were seeing the results right now, unless Wakeone gives an answer to the scandal which is unlikely the public will never move on and the most innocent of them all are the members who are working so hard to win the public back.</p>

      <p>hi old friend ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

and it's fine lol I appreciate insight I don't have even if it's negative I'd rather be realistic than anything else. And I get that I was doing my own trip down memory lane like a large large chunk srsly left it's shocking everytime I look back on stuff everything's been cut in half it sucks. Agreeeeeeeeeee the handling of jiwoongs situation was by far the most abysmal move I've seen in terms of pr they genuinely made it worse than it was initially. This genuinely stresses me out and I'm ngl I pretty much knew it's not hard to tell at all it's just so disheartening seeing how the innocent members are affected like wow I rlly need this bastard to croak asap

      <p>Nothing makes me sadder, and nothing makes me angrier towards him, I despise him and his fans now because the other members have worked so hard and so rigorously only to be met w constant ridicule from the gp.:( I just canâ€™t understand jiwoong either, is he just not ashamed or is he too prideful to just take one for the team and either go on hiatus for the greater good or admit and apologise GOD</p>
