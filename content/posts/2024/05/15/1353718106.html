      <p>the members drink coke zero by the bucketload tho and the boycott has been known for months, i can't see them stopping now unless it's true that this is the members' doing and therefore this is what finally made them aware??????? ðŸ˜­ whenever they'd talk about coke zero i'd just kinda be like "..."

unrelated but i saw that both illit and newjeans are gonna be at that inkigayo festival too #awks</p>
