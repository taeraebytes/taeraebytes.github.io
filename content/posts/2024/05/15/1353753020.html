      <p>Wakeone stupid mistakes while managing zb1

#1 the gap period btwn bp final and debut - zero contents/schedules besides kcon Japan making some bp viewers lost interest 

#2 the gap period btwn in bloom and crush had zero group contents and kept sending hanbin for solo schedules while other members had none making the fandom more divided 

#3 that fuckass fancon 

#4 releasing crush and very bad group promotions  focusing too much on solo/unit schedules

#5 bad at handling jiwoongs scandal and keep showing him

#6 sweat era jiwoong 

#7 ftp is better than crush but other than that same as #4 

#8 40 years old man handling their social media 

#9 ignore the VALID fans demands and concerns (not the stupid demands from solos and akgaes tho)

these can be avoided if zb1 under big co poor my kings 😞</p>
