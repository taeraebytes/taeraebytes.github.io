      <p>"i noticed haos been amping up the haobin yaoi lately and with how desperate he sounds on bbl it all makes sense" another anon and tbh i dont think he is. its more like wakeone is showing us more haobin footage which they would have normally cut out.

wakeone needs to tap into that more so we can be royalty again. jiwoong fucked everything up. he has to be mon existent while those two are front and the first thing people see when they look at the group. look at how sm and hybe are using their groups ships... thats how people get into groups. wakeone also has to put out more group content. its comeback time so why tf is zbtv not putting out episodes??</p>
