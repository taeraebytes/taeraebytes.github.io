      <p>Yujin is neurodivergent, Why do I get the impression that Yujin is being ghosted by a fake phone number? Why is Wonbin going to connect with a high school student? They emphasized hierarchy in Korea, and you cannot be friends with someone younger. I'm scared that if Wonbin confesses he didn't contact Yujin, SM Stan will accuse him of leeching on RIIZE fame ðŸ˜”. I hope this is just my imagination.</p>

      <p>Well, most of the zerose, if you look at their history, come from a background of stanning nugu idols like Verivey and Oneus. These fans have never seen their idol gain this much fame, so they don't want to create drama. The way they butter other idol group stan specially rosins lol they are currently buttering MOAS lol, I think for rosins the idol they stan previously before stanning hao never gained any fame in their lives, so they wanted hao to be the center. In analogy rosins are most likely poor people who won the lottery for ten million dollars but had never seen such a large sum of money before, because of money they behave aggressively and arrogantly.</p>
