      <p>So I’ve been lurking the knetz, cnetz and jnetz  😮‍💨 and these are how (most) people feel about it:
Knetz: meh, it’s cute and the mv is good quality but it’s just meh 🫤 
Cnetz: people hate how disconnected the cowboy and tennis themes are in the mv, they prefer Sweat over it
Jnetz: it’s cute! They like it more than both the knetz and cnetz but it’s not like breathtaking

I’d say the most common theme of criticism from all of them (not from trolls or antis, but genuine criticism) is that the song is trying too hard to have its Fifty Fifty Cupid moment, it lacks unique vocals or synth highlights, and is too bland. I’d say about 1/3rd of people really don’t like the styling and confusing mv and I haven’t seen many people saying it’s amazing.

Imo I agree with most of the sentiment (outside the MV criticisms, I think the MV is nice). I feel like in response to the criticisms Crush got WakeOne swung too far back into the generic territory in order to be safe. But, the song sounds like something any group can do. It doesn’t highlight the group’s unique tones or skills. Sure it does sound like a ZB1 track but a b-side, not a title.
