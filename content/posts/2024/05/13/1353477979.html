      <p>Sinophobia is always going to be a thing that's present and there's nothing we as intl fans can do but support cn (and sea) idols but for Ricky in particular I think his lack of social skills and the fact that he's not that good in Korean yet plays a big part in why he doesn't get schedules, he needs those fashion schedules and magazines shoots because no one else looks like him and his looks always go viral, invertedly I would give less fashion schedules to hao who seem completely uninterested and put him in more variety and singing schedules (which is TBF what they do for him)</p>

      <p>ok but the fashion events do not just nod and agree on who comes, hao will obviously be prioritized for fashion events magazines because he has a hell of a lot more social media presence and sells more</p>

      <p>I haven’t had much time to look at airport fits so if anyone has individual pictures or better quality ones that the group pictures please send the link. Based on the group pictures alone it looks like Hao (Dior) Hanbin and Jiwoong (Gucci) were definitely sponsored. I was going to say Ricky too but his is an already  released piece from Versace, it is possible that he’s being sponsored but he wears designer in that style anyway so it’s harder to know with him unless he was wearing an unreleased line. Also I think some may have been gifted the Jennie X gentle monster line because from my own experience it was super hard getting it and both Hanbin and Gunwook were wearing it with the extra clips ons too. I do think more members could be wearing sponsored fits because a lot of them did look quite coordinated and put together but I’d have to find better quality pictures because it’s hard to tell from shots so far back ~ fashion anon</p>
