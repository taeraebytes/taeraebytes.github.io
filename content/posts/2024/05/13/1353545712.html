      <p>I just scrolled thru the lee mujin channel and WOW Hanbin is definitely one of the worst singers theyâ€™ve had on the show. (Im not saying hes bad, but the idols that get invited are lightyears better than him). He feels so out of place miskeen</p>

      <p>ALRIGHR BRUHðŸ˜­ he's not there are clear non singers on there I guess at first there was a focus on top vocalists in the group but at this point not rlly he's definitely not on the high end but he's not the absolute worst

      <p>tbh iâ€™m not a specialist so sorry for the lack of professional terms but just from listening i think itâ€™s not even his skills, but his voice is very weak and airy and nothing can really change that i think? so i would prefer to listen to a weaker singer who has a nice strong voice unless they fuck up the notes completelyâ€¦ or like gunwook whoâ€™s afaik at around the same level skill wise but just has a fuller and more energetic tone</p>

      <p>Yea that's my preference as well his tone is always going to be super light and airy with a good song selection he can sound real good but idt this cover was the right choice

      <p>no you can control how much air you let out while you sing (speaking as someone with raspy voice) he just didn't have enough training on it he didn't sound this airy in bp i wonder how it got this bad :/ cut down on zero cola and coffee please hanbin</p>
