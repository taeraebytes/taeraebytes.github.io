      <p>i think people are more mad that she acted like she was a hanbin stan when she just isnt?? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ if she were like yeah i dont like hanbin nobody would be batting an eye. her username is literally sung hanbin. people like that should just accept what they are and not cling or hide onto the "im a ot9 zerose" thing.</p>

      <p>I don't know this user so I won't speak for her but personally I tend to be more critical of artists I actually love than the ones idc about, also sometimes you look an idol for something else I love Taemin but he isn't a very skilled singer for ex</p>

      <p>these people move like a cult if you're not worshipping their fav and dont think he's the best singer in the world you're an anti but like anyone with good functioning ears and unbiased can tell how much of a weak vocalist hanbin is like i'm sorry even that magnetic snippet with the auto-tune and editing he still sounds messy and weak idk</p>

      <p>To put it quite bluntly they are overworked, all have / borderline have eds, never rest, are constantly travelling and promoting. This is a temporary group and unfortunately itâ€™s not going to slow down were lucky that as of right now only 1 person has had a physical injury (the hand thing with hb) and that didnâ€™t interfere with schedule. If you look at kep1er even physical injury will not stop wakeone overworking them, a member lost her parent and within less than a couple weeks was promoting again.</p>

      <p>the fact that when mma 2023 last year, hanbin left first and the members stay still until the awards ended. it was when hanbin mom's suddenly collapsed and she was being hospitalized. and the next day, zb1 has a fansign schedules and hanbin came to the fansign to, but hanbin eyes were swollen at that time (but no one noticed it excepts allins), hanbin's lil sis who always update about his brother winning at awards, suddenly didn't upload anything until hanbin came to the fansign... wk1 really treated their idols like a robot not as an human...</p>
