      <p>If Matthew wasn’t an idol he’d be such a good f*ckboy, and not the toxic frat boy ones but the progressive, left leaning ones that have emotional intelligence so they can easily make emotional connections but that’s almost worse because he’d actively choose to break hearts understanding the weight of his actions but proceed to surrender to his own selfish pleasure and ruin people’s lives.</p>

      <p>Dorks always be slinging the most dick, why do you think nerds always have the biggest body count, do polyamory, and are swingers? They’re just more socially correct fuckboys 🤷‍♀️  Also that’s why bandkids fuck and interbred like rabbits</p>

      <p>JFJNFNFNNDNDNDNNDNS ok that's like a minority of dorks most aren't like that but Matthew would probably only have like 3 bodies

      <p>I explained to oomf but lemme summarize this was back in January but basically the two were pretty close and spent so much time tgthr 1on1 and Ricky would send her pics of himself at midnight and ask for fit rates but they were selfies 😭 it was kind of cute actually but they played games tgthr did he tgthr she said he stopped contact w everyone around summer 2020 but she said just the two of them had contact recently I'm inferring a lot of this just cuz this girl was so dense but I need to find the chars
