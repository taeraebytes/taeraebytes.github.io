      <p>As much as it pains me to say this, Matthew has to lose some of his muscles. His dancing has become sloppier(?) or not as sharp as it once was? It’s hard to describe. Seeing those dance studio videos of them dancing to sweat solidified that fact for me.</p>

      <p>Well he has short arms so he never really looked good holding them up, it's worse now he's even more bulky. Personally I think his moves are still sharp and his expressions are good, but his hair gotta go</p>
