      <p>we talking about jiwoong right? hmmm tbh I can see him leaving from guilt for the horrible rep the jebis are getting because of him. in the recent voice recording thing didnt hanbin say while deciding the title track and listening to feel the pop jiwoong wasn't there? he also wasnt there in the sweat dance practice behind zepisode because of an 'event' but he has no schedules. its as if theyre slowly starting to do things without him so maybe theres some merit to this rumor? i dont know either just weird how this rumor suddenly popped up but now that i look back at certain situation it kinda adds up?</p>
