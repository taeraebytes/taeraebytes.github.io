      <p>Yujin is neurodivergent, Why do I get the impression that Yujin is being ghosted by a fake phone number? Why is Wonbin going to connect with a high school student? They emphasized hierarchy in Korea, and you cannot be friends with someone younger. I'm scared that if Wonbin confesses he didn't contact Yujin, SM Stan will accuse him of leeching on RIIZE fame ðŸ˜”. I hope this is just my imagination.</p>
