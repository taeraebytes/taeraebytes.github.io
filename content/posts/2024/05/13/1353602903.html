      <p>Fashion anon must be an oracle or something because Gucci sent woongsungz gifts from their cruise collection and their tags had #guccifriends so the might be friends of the house as of now. Which makes sense because that‚Äôs the closest they can get without the official ba role so they still have freedom with other brands. Also it must be serious if they were going to get invited to their cruise show in London had the comeback not fallen on the same day.</p>
