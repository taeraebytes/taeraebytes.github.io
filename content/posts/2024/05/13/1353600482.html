      <p>completely objective here, song is avg

-no 'killing part' as in no suspense just lowkey boring throughout the entire song, even the rap and bridge part gave nothing
-no unique vocals and tones so makes the song even more avg/ boring, idk what it is but something about this songs vocals is missing, I'm not talking about members belting notes, there's just something missing
-same drng drng drng beat gets repetitive and once more adds to the boring-ness

I get this song is suppose to be chill/ cute which may explain the boring-ness, blandness but yea idk</p>

      <p>Their missing good production and vocal layering also the vocals and the beat are the same volume so a lot has already gotten muddle from the mixing 

It's just an average feel good song but I can't deny it's a fun listen as well at least the replay value seems to be there but it's interesting that sped up version has better care for the vocals than the og
