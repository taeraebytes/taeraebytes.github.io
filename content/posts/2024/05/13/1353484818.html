      <p>I was watching soundbomb360 behind and some music show fancams where they are on stage interacting with fans, and I noticed he barely says anything which I wouldnâ€™t find strange if I didnâ€™t know his personality like he normally loves yapping sm but he looked so small on stage i felt bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ yujin for example didnâ€™t utter a word, but that's who he is and the with the way he carried himself he looked confident can't say the same for matt tho</p>
