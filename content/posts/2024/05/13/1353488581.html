    "question": "I’ve had some interesting meetings today and coming back to this is made me re think some things about zb1 in relation to luxury brands. I don’t know if the premise of zb1 contracts will allow for individual ambassadorships, I know that a kep1er member has one but it’s for a cosmetic brand in Japan so I don’t know what the likelihood of a luxury brand being allowed. But using hb as an example I do think Gucci want to work with them / him. It’s been nearly a year and they are still consistently dressing him for events and appearances and this I found interesting https://x.com/86400shb/status/1789692073966526550?s=46 because his shorts and trainers are from the new Lido collection that dropped recently. Usually that’s the stuff a brand would want them to wear on the way to a destination it’s not often they wear sponsored clothes when flying back (any of the members) so this definitely piqued my interest and I noticed his MC suit was Gucci too. I’ve been here a while and I remember someone mentioning that they wanted to pursue an ambassadorship with one of the two early this year (hb/jw) my professional opinion is if the current climate around jw doesn’t improve they will drop him and focus on hb. The only thing with ambassadorships though is they usually require the artist to have individual social media to promote and post about the brand which is why I find it highly unlikely that for the duration of ZB1 any of the members will be allowed to become official ambassadors for a luxury brand unless it’s a whole group thing. Another member whose dressed in different brands a lot of hao but again the heavy rotation of brands makes me think ambassadorship is getting less likely for members because at first he wore a lot of Loewe and in my eyes that showed him building a strong business relationship with that brand, now again whether or not they offered a Ba role and it was declined because of the nature of this being a temporary group I don’t know but I think the step back may be an indication as to why he’s wearing a lot of different brands more recently~ fashion anon",

      <p>Sinophobia is always going to be a thing that's present and there's nothing we as intl fans can do but support cn (and sea) idols but for Ricky in particular I think his lack of social skills and the fact that he's not that good in Korean yet plays a big part in why he doesn't get schedules, he needs those fashion schedules and magazines shoots because no one else looks like him and his looks always go viral, invertedly I would give less fashion schedules to hao who seem completely uninterested and put him in more variety and singing schedules (which is TBF what they do for him)</p>

      <p>ok but the fashion events do not just nod and agree on who comes, hao will obviously be prioritized for fashion events magazines because he has a hell of a lot more social media presence and sells more</p>

      <p>I haven’t had much time to look at airport fits so if anyone has individual pictures or better quality ones that the group pictures please send the link. Based on the group pictures alone it looks like Hao (Dior) Hanbin and Jiwoong (Gucci) were definitely sponsored. I was going to say Ricky too but his is an already  released piece from Versace, it is possible that he’s being sponsored but he wears designer in that style anyway so it’s harder to know with him unless he was wearing an unreleased line. Also I think some may have been gifted the Jennie X gentle monster line because from my own experience it was super hard getting it and both Hanbin and Gunwook were wearing it with the extra clips ons too. I do think more members could be wearing sponsored fits because a lot of them did look quite coordinated and put together but I’d have to find better quality pictures because it’s hard to tell from shots so far back ~ fashion anon</p>
