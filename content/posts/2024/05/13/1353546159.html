      <p>I really don't understand Kpop stans wanting their faves to be gay so bad... It's going to be hell for them in Korean entertainment if they're outed. International fans should seriously learn the Korean culture and how fucked up their mindset is. South Korea isn't for the gay. Just enjoy the music and artistry. If you want gay contents, Thai entertainment industry is waiting for you.</p>
