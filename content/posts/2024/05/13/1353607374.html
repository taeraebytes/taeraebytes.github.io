      <p>has been having so many arguments with his members, he has a hard time fitting in 

matthew? I mean bro is going through it with his status in zb1 and his old homie found new friends leaving him behind and maknae line are tight af so he doesnt really fit in either. I rewatched the anniversary video when they were all playing the party hat game trying to guess the polaroid he was standing off to the side alone while everyone else was messing with yujin and jiwoong. I wonder what happened</p>
