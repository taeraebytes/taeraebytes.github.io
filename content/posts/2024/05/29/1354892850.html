      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>I don’t get the logic of rosins thinking every single offer he gets will go through. If that were the case you might aswell stan a soloist and even then because of scheduling it doesn’t work. They are in a group which means. 99% of the time solo and unit schedules don’t have to fit just one member but also work around group stuff too. If hao went to every job he got offered he’d be missing from a lot of group stuff and then yall would complain about ot8.</p>
