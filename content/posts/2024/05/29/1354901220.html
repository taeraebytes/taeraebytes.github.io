      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>Girl zhanghao of zerobaseone didn't get invited to fashion week 😭 and someone informed me of that rumor months ago and lets say there was some universe he got invited it got rejected because of yura yura like there's usually reason behind rejection this show would've taken weeks to film he's a temp rookie

      <p>I’m more curious as to why the brands are contact the cbar instead of the artists actual company ? Like am I the only one finding it weird this sort of information isn’t going the management first. And then what the cbar just emails wakeone like btw here is an offer for hao.</p>

      <p>did y'all forget about what happened with l'officiel and wakeone, wakeone giving them very late reply when in china you must discussed some promotion stuffs about the magz, c ent industry is different, someone even said when the company pissed one brand or act unprofessionally it will spread to other brands too and they're gonna blacklist you</p>

      <p>no one said wakeone isn't unprofessional or bad either it was good that zhbar stepped in for communication but imo constant communication where the bar comes before the company isn't a great look either I'm sure zhbar is prioritizing hao but also u cant get or accept everything

      <p>I agree with this because if a brand is contacting the cbar about offers that were never going to be able to go through in the first place it looks worse after all that communication for wakeone to say no. Whereas if they went straight to wakeone a lot of that middle man convo could have been cut. You can tell they were doing most the communication with the cbar too because the promotion poster said rosin instead of zerose and wakeone would have never let that slide.</p>

      <p>it's better for communication to be between wakeone and these companies zhbar doesn't have haos full schedule and he's an idol operating in korea I don't see the point in putting pressure on wakeone to accept solo gigs he might have to miss schedules for or prioritize solo work in china over group stuff which is gonna stop in like 1.8 yrs

      <p>this is true and i agree with it but its an ideal situation like wakeone is really unprofessional with answering their mails or giving a proper response too i think its possible they already have a terrible reputation with brands and companies (on the cside)</p>

      <p>They could have terrible rep but if brands rllt wanna work w hao they will like that show is seriously begging it so bad. While wakeone is unprofessional it still was never gonna be a realistic endeavor and this understaffed company that can barely get by day to day I doubt they're getting through all the love calls

      <p>I’m going to be so serious and say wakeone is probably shit at responding to emails because they have 1 inbox and it gets spammed daily by multiple subfandoms and like 3 employees to work through it</p>
