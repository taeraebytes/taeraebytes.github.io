      <p>matthew is definitely not a kpop stan especially during early zb1 you could tell he didnâ€™t even know a lot of the big hits but obviously he learned after being surrounded by a bunch of kpop stans for over a year. he definitely did like jay park as an artist tho i mean he auditioned with his song ðŸ˜­ but his sister did clarify that he only liked his music and was aware of the fact that heâ€™s problematic and doesnâ€™t support him like that (something along those lines).</p>
