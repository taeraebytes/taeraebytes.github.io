      <p>I was stanning yujin earlier but I stop stanning him realizing I'm stanning a fucking robot he lacks emotion I have never seen him crying or getting emotional, he is not able to fulfill job of maknae, like maknae job is to cry that mf never shed a one drop of tears.</p>

      <p>funfact, some c-mullbokdans actually stan him because he's a maknae. maknaes are usually spoiled, crybabies and bratty (just like sehun). But Yujin isn't like that at all so they keep pushing their yujin princess agenda on him and they even hate hao for being a spoiled bratðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Once he opens up more I see the Jungkook vision too, Jungkook was pretty timid but he's kinda physco when he's around the proper ppl and sometimes when Yujin is with Ricky I really do see the mini Jungkook vision.

He lowkey looks like Jungkook too but longer face where Jungkook's is rounder and it's kinda trippy because I can see him walking down the same golden maknae path but in the 5th gen.</p>
