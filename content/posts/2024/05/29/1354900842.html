      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>
