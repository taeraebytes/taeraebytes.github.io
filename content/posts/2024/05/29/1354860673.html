      <p>its late and prob late for everyone else here but i gen know nothing bout zico so if anons can help a homie out and briefly summarize for me to understand why this isnt good I'd greatly appreciate it cause i was actually so excited we got a ot9 gig after being jobless ðŸ˜­ like i thought this was our way back into kgp hearts and maybe with this show theyd stop giving a fk about jiwoong and give us a chance and the reason i think this is cuz spot is doing well on the charts so i thought k gp opinions of zico is really good ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>korean GENERAL PUBLIC opinions on zico is great lol, majority of them dont actually believe hes involved in burning sun just like how they still support bigbang. there are knetz who hate them but the guy is extremely unaffected, the industry loves him he goes viral and his kusic is popular</p>
