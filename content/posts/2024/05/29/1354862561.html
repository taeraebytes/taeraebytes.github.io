      <p>LOL og anon here and since this anon asked I guessssssss I have no choice but to explain ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜œ well idk its just the vibes so I could be dead wrong. I've noticed he's just been extra affectionate with ricky since this year started but I also know he's been saying since zb1 formed that he wanted to get closer to ricky BUT the way he sometimes glances at ricky has me thinking like ðŸ˜³ there was this one clip of him glancing at ricky on a radio show i think in feb or something that really started to make me think this way plus that japan bubble live snuggle ðŸ¤¤ the vibes when hes with ricky its different from everyone else and im saying this as someone who rides the haobin/ riwook train</p>

      <p>u dumb bitches dont see the vision. hanbin is ur typical boy next door anime class president and ricky is the foreign introverted shy exchange student who has no friends since he just came here and being the class president its hanbins duty to make sure every student is happy and comfortable so he somehow makes ricky join their after school band club and ricky slowly opens up and before u know it hanbin started to feel some typa way</p>
