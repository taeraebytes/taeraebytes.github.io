      <p>I was going to sign this off fashion anon but I realise I have an account now and can just ask this publicly ðŸ˜‚. 

If itâ€™s Gucci sponsored it might be to promote a new line, in which it could be for a bigger magazine that Gucci is featuring on and chose to use him as the model. It was a similar situation for arena homme, they (hb,jw) were chosen to promote Guccis new line. So itâ€™s likely that Gucci already has a slot and wants him to represent them, if so I think it will further solidify my theory on them only really wanting to work with him.
