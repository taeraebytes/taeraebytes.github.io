      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>are there not multiple admins in zhbar but the way they act made me think one or more of them are probably from yuahua, my other chinese actress fav has ppl from her agency as admins in her supertopic</p>

      <p>There are ofc one person isn't running a bar but I just refer to zhbar as one person cuz it's not like they make it apparent that there's multiple admins and it just makes it easier but hmmmm that could be possible ngl
