      <p>Hanbin eats up Thursday for himself and Yujin Sunday. ZB1 adjust their schedules according to the MCing schedules of these 2,  but other members aren't paid, of course. So, Ii don't think it's wrong for other members to have side hustles too because Hanbin has been doing it regulary for 8 months now...</p>

      <p>Who said he couldn't have a side hustle but I'd honestly rather if most of the group did not have a side hustle
