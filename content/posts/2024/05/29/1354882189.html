      <p>What are the chances that Haobin will debut as a unit? Why am I getting a strong feeling that they will debut as a unit? Like,Â  I'm 80% sure both Hanbin Company and Yeuhua will capitalize as this duo? Because I don't think Hao is going to debut with Yeuhua, they probably added someone who was born in 2009 or 2010.</p>
