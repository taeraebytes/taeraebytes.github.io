      <p>its late and prob late for everyone else here but i gen know nothing bout zico so if anons can help a homie out and briefly summarize for me to understand why this isnt good I'd greatly appreciate it cause i was actually so excited we got a ot9 gig after being jobless ðŸ˜­ like i thought this was our way back into kgp hearts and maybe with this show theyd stop giving a fk about jiwoong and give us a chance and the reason i think this is cuz spot is doing well on the charts so i thought k gp opinions of zico is really good ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>korean GENERAL PUBLIC opinions on zico is great lol, majority of them dont actually believe hes involved in burning sun just like how they still support bigbang. there are knetz who hate them but the guy is extremely unaffected, the industry loves him he goes viral and his kusic is popular</p>

      <p>going on a tangent but do u guys think the other bigbang members knew what seungri was doing? I feel like at most they were suss at what was actually going on but never bothered or cared to dig into it.</p>

      <p>they did they didnt want to be the whistleblower even though they warned him PUBLICLY many times, bc they themselves had their own scandals. they wrrent close to seungri and he was jealous of them, so its plausible he could have blackmailed them seeing his strong ties to gvmt officials and even police.</p>

      <p>Diff anon and I saw an interview where they were asked how do u see each members in 5 years and they were like taeyang is married blah blah blah and that the four of them have been promoting well without Seungri and Seungri keeps asking to borrow money ðŸ˜­ I guess its their way of telling him to get his shit together and subtly warning him/ shading him.

I feel like they knew what was going on but at the same time didn't know the extent with the kakao rooms. Probably chose to just stay ignorant because Seungri prob got shit on them like this anon said and they're a group so like what can you really do without self sabotaging yourself.</p>

      <p>BFNFNNDJDMTMMGMFMDK NO WAYðŸ˜­ I don't think they had details details but they knew generally they probably were never gonna say anything if it got exposed like they might have been against it but still I mean I'm not gonna say they're evil but yea at least they seemed to be distant from seungri or not fw what he was doing
