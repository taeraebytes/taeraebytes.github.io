      <p>Aespa 500K 1st day sales... Why do I feel like KPop is about to lose the hype sooner than imagined... 3rd gen was the peak but they ruined the Pop in Kpop. Then 4th gen totally ruined it with the generic music to stay afloat. 5th gen is worst. I actually thought that ZB1 will save 5th gen, but Wakeone made ZB1 a group with questionable music. At some point, Kpop needs to go back to 2nd gen quality...</p>
