      <p>I was stanning yujin earlier but I stop stanning him realizing I'm stanning a fucking robot he lacks emotion I have never seen him crying or getting emotional, he is not able to fulfill job of maknae, like maknae job is to cry that mf never shed a one drop of tears.</p>

      <p>funfact, some c-mullbokdans actually stan him because he's a maknae. maknaes are usually spoiled, crybabies and bratty (just like sehun). But Yujin isn't like that at all so they keep pushing their yujin princess agenda on him and they even hate hao for being a spoiled bratðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
