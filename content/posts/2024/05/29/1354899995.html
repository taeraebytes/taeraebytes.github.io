      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>Girl zhanghao of zerobaseone didn't get invited to fashion week 😭 and someone informed me of that rumor months ago and lets say there was some universe he got invited it got rejected because of yura yura like there's usually reason behind rejection this show would've taken weeks to film he's a temp rookie
