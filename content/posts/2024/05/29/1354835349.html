      <p>LOL og anon here and since this anon asked I guessssssss I have no choice but to explain ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜œ well idk its just the vibes so I could be dead wrong. I've noticed he's just been extra affectionate with ricky since this year started but I also know he's been saying since zb1 formed that he wanted to get closer to ricky BUT the way he sometimes glances at ricky has me thinking like ðŸ˜³ there was this one clip of him glancing at ricky on a radio show i think in feb or something that really started to make me think this way plus that japan bubble live snuggle ðŸ¤¤ the vibes when hes with ricky its different from everyone else and im saying this as someone who rides the haobin/ riwook train</p>
