      <p>thought we knew by now solos are bipolar schizos but yeah they making that shit up I'm always on ktwt and it made no noise, the only kforum it kinda made noise on was theqoo but for theqoo standards the comments isnt even bad like they're saying stuff we as fans are saying ðŸ˜­ falsetto unnecessary, members off pitch even if hanbin and taerae did well their falsettos were questionable, they don't understand the song as in tempo is weird, why does the song have so many falsetto for a boy group, why giving weaker members more lines etc. the person who got it worst was yujin they kept calling him tone deaf and didnt get why he got so many lines.

that's it. if you know theqoo and how hard they go in these comments aren't that bad at all</p>
