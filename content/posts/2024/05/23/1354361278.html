      <p>I‚Äôve noticed that he use honorifics with hao and hanbin but he still call hao by his name without adding hyung sometimes which i find kinda endearing ig hao is the only one from the hyung line who the younger members can call by name and he seems fine with it idk if its bc hes a foreigner</p>
