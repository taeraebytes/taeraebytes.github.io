      <p>Idc about ricky and jiwoong, but I hope yujin and his parents see all of the negative comment and send his ass to good vocal coaching class like we are all rooting for him and he has bright future career ahead but he keep performing bad 👎  he will be next male sakura.</p>

      <p>seungeon is currently in top3 vocalists in all of 4th gen males just "can support" is downplaying him and ricky and yujin can support as well altho yujin is quite inconsistent with it oh and yunseo is pretty good too a little below gunwook but who cares about him tbh</p>
