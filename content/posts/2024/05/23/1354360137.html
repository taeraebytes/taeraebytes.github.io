      <p>I feel like song wise they always go to extremes with comebacks, either too noisy for the public (although I liked crush..) or too "bubbly" (feel the pop). They would do perfectly fine with bp style songs such as Hot summer which has 3rd gen or earlier vibes. But we will never get that</p>
