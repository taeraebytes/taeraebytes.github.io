      <p>(same anon about the heolkek cafe) they seem to REALLY dislike gyuvin, they see him as those weird religious and manipulative men and they also really like ricky, they dont mentioned yujin at all and gunwook its not mentioned that much either ig most of the people in there are women on their 20s or 30s</p>
