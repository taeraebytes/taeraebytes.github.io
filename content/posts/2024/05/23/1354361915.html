      <p>I actually think taerae is one of those rare cases where he has skill and tone because remember when he blew up for his one line in hot summer? ugh wakeone needs to cater some of their songs to his tone and stop giving him high notes and adlibs only ðŸ™„</p>

      <p>I just watched his cover posted in zb1 YouTube, this guy is a ballad singer through and throughðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's missing that training to make his voice more palatable for kpop that sm vocalists get but hes definitely not showing off what he has now</p>

      <p>Where do you get your confidence, anon? No, you do not NEED vibrato to belt. Vibrato is when the voice steadily vibrates/wavers on a single pitch. Belting is singing with full chest voice. While vibrato does serve some purpose in muscle engagement/relaxation, it is still STYLISTIC and singers can actively choose to employ it or not. There are also singers who just straight up don't have it naturally. Taerae doesn't use it much for whatever reason even when he belts. Meanwhile Ricky over-uses it.</p>

      <p>diff anon but this reminded me way back during in bloom when i first noticed ricky's use of vibratos which I thought was interesting


<a href="https://youtu.be/9NgznjE2boU?si=JpsiGHL9yhAGS3qF&t=459">https://youtu.be/9NgznjE2boU?si=JpsiGHL9yhAGS3qF&t=459</a>

at 7:40 u can clearly hear the difference between him and gunwook so this is a good example, ricky words flutters at end like ~ because of his use of vibratos but I think that's just his singing style and pretty common in rnb which I think his fans said inspired him so it makes sense. i aint no pro but it sounds good and its more of a stylistic choice which gives his singing style personality imo. Like aside from his tone u can tell its him singing just by the style BUT I can see it being 'too much' if it stands too much from a group song thats supposed to blend together but idt its at that point.</p>

      <p>Ohhhhhh I hear the difference and I think for his parts in inbloom it was perfect and everyone liked it I think the issue might be he applies it where it's not needed hence the overuse
