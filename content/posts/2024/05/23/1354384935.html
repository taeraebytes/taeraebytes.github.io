      <p>I actually think taerae is one of those rare cases where he has skill and tone because remember when he blew up for his one line in hot summer? ugh wakeone needs to cater some of their songs to his tone and stop giving him high notes and adlibs only ðŸ™„</p>

      <p>I just watched his cover posted in zb1 YouTube, this guy is a ballad singer through and throughðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's missing that training to make his voice more palatable for kpop that sm vocalists get but hes definitely not showing off what he has now</p>

      <p>Where do you get your confidence, anon? No, you do not NEED vibrato to belt. Vibrato is when the voice steadily vibrates/wavers on a single pitch. Belting is singing with full chest voice. While vibrato does serve some purpose in muscle engagement/relaxation, it is still STYLISTIC and singers can actively choose to employ it or not. There are also singers who just straight up don't have it naturally. Taerae doesn't use it much for whatever reason even when he belts. Meanwhile Ricky over-uses it.</p>

      <p>Ricky overuses it since he can't thread on notes for far too long and tapping vibrato would save him since it doesn't require you to hit a particular note. But he sounds good. Hao is the member who uses vibrato so well. He can even make one at the end of a long high notes. Gunwook can also deliver beautiful vibrato. He just need to learn 
when to use them. Airy voice like Hanbin's would have a hard time doing vibrato. Or it's just a skill issue for him. His voice is too thin and too airy. For Taerae, probably he wasn't trained to make vibrato since he has a wide range. But vibrato sounds good if use correctly</p>

      <p>I can see that I think? I see the overuse with Ricky and I noticed that point with hanbin like for ex his mp high note even the studio version I didn't like and taerae I think relies on a lot of his strength? rather than that idk I'm just getting the hang of thisðŸ˜­
