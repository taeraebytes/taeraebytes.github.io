      <p>everyone saying this is bad what do you mean they are not tearing them, yujin ricky are catching the most strays

      <p>Idc about ricky and jiwoong, but I hope yujin and his parents see all of the negative comment and send his ass to good vocal coaching class like we are all rooting for him and he has bright future career ahead but he keep performing bad ðŸ‘Ž  he will be next male sakura.</p>

      <p>seungeon is currently in top3 vocalists in all of 4th gen males just "can support" is downplaying him and ricky and yujin can support as well altho yujin is quite inconsistent with it oh and yunseo is pretty good too a little below gunwook but who cares about him tbh</p>

      <p>In 4th Gen absolutely not idt I rlly need to keep up to know I'm sure he's improved but there are genuinely great vocalists in that gen. I don't know much about vocals but I have ears if I find him unpleasant I'm gonna have my opinions still and 4th gen is a big big bigggg over estimation I can give it to you for 5th gen tho I still would rather hear a rodent sing tho
