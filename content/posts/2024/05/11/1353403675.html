      <p>these members are just not bright. ppl always laugh at the no media training jokes till one of them slips up. 
ranking the members from their need to be in full attendance and get a 100% in their media training class to get ahold of their phones:
1. gyuvin - no amount of lessons will save this guy. we will accept the controversies as we go 
2. ricky - was harmless till he had the freedom of contacting fans without supervision 
3. matthew - needs to learn how to censor himself even if it is an attempt at being funny 
4. taerae - everyday its evnne FUCK OFFFFFFFFFFFF
5. hanbin - enough with the constant coddling to fans. boohoo u didnt get ur 300th schedule
6. hao - again he does too much to try to be funny so it costs us controversies like bruh 
7. yujin - this boy doesnt speak 
8. gunwook - he's almost too careful that he gets caught up in controversies. poor guy</p>

      <p>Nah gunwook had that Japan football thing and was too much of a beg with fans at the beginning of zb1, I do agree he's the best at balancing humour and idol appropriateness now though</p>

      <p>what he said for the japan soccer thing was pretty neutral even tho the clip that was being posted was out of context he stated he wanted korea to win and it only blew up through troll accs that got enough attention. he's calmed down the flirting but they all pretty much had a concept at the beginning he just went too crazyðŸ˜­ but agree he's found his footing but even now he gets dragged for the most appropriate responses
