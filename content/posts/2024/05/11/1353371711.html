      <p>the half brother/step mom thing was spread by his fans who tried to hide it. him and his brother look identical and somehow very little like their dad + his “stepmom” has been his mom for at least 12 years + the person who originally said he was mixed was an old classmate not even a fan who apologized bc they didn’t think it was that big of a deal after getting spammed by his fans to delete the post not that it was false info + he gets commented on by surgeons for looking mixed race bc of his nose bridge, the space between his eyes, and brow bone (?) + someone straight up asked his dad at the fancon if the white woman was his mom and he said yes + he would travel to europe a lot as a kid</p>

      <p>I knew about his wasian brother since around October so I'm not sure but eunseok being told he looks mixed just reminded me of how they would say that kind of stuff to jihyo like an actual wasian a German one at that will always look way more white. But lemme ask lotus cuz his brother is like 16 years younger than him
