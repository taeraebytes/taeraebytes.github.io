      <p>great. kriyangis are acting up, criyangis were already acting up but now theyre even more insufferable ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ when will we be able to catch a break. its just a fucking teaser. we all know that the teaser never represents what the mv screentime distribution is looking like. i hope wakeone takes rickys phone away or something. he probably saw fans complain on plus chat and was like "yeah you guys are actually true" who tf does that. he fell off my bias list. he also couldnt even properly sing during yura yura
