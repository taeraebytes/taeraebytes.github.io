      <p>i think people are more mad that she acted like she was a hanbin stan when she just isnt?? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ if she were like yeah i dont like hanbin nobody would be batting an eye. her username is literally sung hanbin. people like that should just accept what they are and not cling or hide onto the "im a ot9 zerose" thing.</p>

      <p>these people move like a cult if you're not worshipping their fav and dont think he's the best singer in the world you're an anti but like anyone with good functioning ears and unbiased can tell how much of a weak vocalist hanbin is like i'm sorry even that magnetic snippet with the auto-tune and editing he still sounds messy and weak idk</p>
