      <p>I get it's upsetting but is it rlly that serious that it would fuck up their rollout 😭😭 I rlly don't think it will just another day of a kpop company making a bad move we'll live. I feel like we give too much power to negative emotions when this is the norm of the kpop fan experience but that's crazy

      <p>Im not a new to kpop (I've been here since 2013). I don't know if ur always this dense, but you guys sound stupid so let me break it down for you:

1- zb1 is a temporary group with limited time and content. They are not a 7-year-old group whose members missed a one-time thing; they only have about. a year and half left.

2. This is a schedule set by the company. They booked an entire amusement park knowing one member is not going to be here.

3. zhang Hao was away for 2 days, not 2 months. how hard can it be to reschedule ? 

4. even Kfans are mad in the yt comments, so why are you guys defending wakeone like that? It's embarrassing

It's always “unserious” when it comes to him. I hope your favorite will experience the same shit at least once; maybe then you'll get it.</p>

      <p>OH BROTHERRRRRR yes I'm gonna find ppl crashing out over a yt episode ridiculous genuinely the responses were reaching new levels of insane that's no longer simply being mad. you ppl have gotten too comfortable with ur obsession and insanity that u can't even recognize when it's too much you guys love to bring up kfans for reaction purposes yes they're mad too but they're not crashing out like irosins u guys should rlly take a page out their book😭😭
