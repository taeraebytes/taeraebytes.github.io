      <p>Sinophobia is always going to be a thing that's present and there's nothing we as intl fans can do but support cn (and sea) idols but for Ricky in particular I think his lack of social skills and the fact that he's not that good in Korean yet plays a big part in why he doesn't get schedules, he needs those fashion schedules and magazines shoots because no one else looks like him and his looks always go viral, invertedly I would give less fashion schedules to hao who seem completely uninterested and put him in more variety and singing schedules (which is TBF what they do for him)</p>
