    "question": "Hao serving twink is funny but itâ€™s a bit annoying he canâ€™t do anything else when he dances other than pop p*ssy or give facial expressions that are just cute or acting like a side twink. Like yes serving is a serve but add a bigger variety of dancing styles and facial expressions under your repertoire!!! I want femme dancers to passably do masc dances and Vice versa, this goes to Taerae too. Hanbin can do both well despite being twink #3 so there are no excuses and I ainâ€™t no homophobe for thinking this, just a gay dancer who pays attention to fancams",
