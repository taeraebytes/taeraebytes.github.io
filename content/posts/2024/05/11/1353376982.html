      <p>If anyone is interested in some Kendrick Drake beef tea: "All of Drake corporate partners along with UMG just finished their Zoom call and about to have lunch, emails were sent to pgLAng (Kendricks own label) management an hour ago

UMG executives watching us scream "A minorrrrrrrrrrrrrr" about their musician who is only second to Swift, dog, someone needs to step in and have a one on one with Dot come clean and say he won but money is starting to get compromised lol please stand down"

The rolling stone magazine calling Kendrick the winner was to motivate him to stop and not drop his other tracks, he's in a dangerous position now cause he's not against a person but an industry and if he goes too far they'll get him cancelled, set him up, put him in jail or worse, they might even do it now
I do want him to crash out obvs butðŸ‘€ some very big sponsors and names are on the line, the blind items about all this are very interesting</p>

My theory is that something happened in 2022 that made everyone switch up against Drake, or he did something and became paranoid because of his actions: After the Pusha t thing he came back very strongly with Scorpion and it was advertised as strongly as Taylor's TTPD aka lots of playlisting, ads everywhere, they clearly worked hard to rebuilt his untouchable pop star image, then while he had some sneak disses and arguments by 2021 he made up with two of his biggest music opps (ye and the weeknd) and had a very chill, pretty positive album (her loss), this is also when Kendrick makes his own label

He doesn't drop in 2022 but has an insane fatherhood pr run, Kendrick does drop Mr Morale, and then in 2023 Drake comes back ANGRY and extra bitter with foatd and vol 3 he starts dissing ye and Abel again but also riri, asap, and even his good friends Future. He also threatens everyone that he HAS compromising infos on everyone and asked for a Kendrick feature on FPS (that Kendrick rejected) looking back it looks like he was feeling something could be coming against him and was threatening in advance andd wanted to squash the beef with Kendrick 

Then in 2024 Kendrick drops Like that, Drake drops two records and then before Kendrick responds, The Weeknd managers house gets shot (obvs their beef got reawoken in foatd but the timing is interesting) then Kendrick drops two records and strongly implies that Drakes team were the ones that shot at cashs house and tell him his looking into the wrong people because the people leaking him infos are from OVO

Drake was also investing in some very weird companies 2021-2023 it looks to me he massively fucked up and pissed off all his artist friends (how come NONE of his friends defend him) and I also do believe he's in some shady trafficking things</p>
