      <p>i think people are more mad that she acted like she was a hanbin stan when she just isnt?? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ if she were like yeah i dont like hanbin nobody would be batting an eye. her username is literally sung hanbin. people like that should just accept what they are and not cling or hide onto the "im a ot9 zerose" thing.</p>
