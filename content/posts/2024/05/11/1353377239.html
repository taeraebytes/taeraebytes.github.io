      <p>i feel like hanbins popularity in japan has grown CRAZILY. i saw if being discussed by a jzerose today, and even just being on that side of twt u will notice the amount of hit tweets he gets (as do a lot of zb1 and kpop in general, but him in particular for his personality). ofc hes always been popular in the group too but i feel like he might be top3 now</p>
