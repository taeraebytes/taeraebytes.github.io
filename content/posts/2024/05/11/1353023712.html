      <p>If anyone is interested in some Kendrick Drake beef tea: "All of Drake corporate partners along with UMG just finished their Zoom call and about to have lunch, emails were sent to pgLAng (Kendricks own label) management an hour ago

UMG executives watching us scream "A minorrrrrrrrrrrrrr" about their musician who is only second to Swift, dog, someone needs to step in and have a one on one with Dot come clean and say he won but money is starting to get compromised lol please stand down"

The rolling stone magazine calling Kendrick the winner was to motivate him to stop and not drop his other tracks, he's in a dangerous position now cause he's not against a person but an industry and if he goes too far they'll get him cancelled, set him up, put him in jail or worse, they might even do it now
I do want him to crash out obvs butðŸ‘€ some very big sponsors and names are on the line, the blind items about all this are very interesting</p>
