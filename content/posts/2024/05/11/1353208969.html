    "question": "Do nawt get me wrong I think Gunwook is styled fine and he looks good but I wish WakeOne would style him differently sometimes, like do something interesting with his features and physique. I wanna see what he looks like in a shaggy mullet and a band t-shirt or like (yes imma bring it up again even though itâ€™s ages ago) the exact styling of BP ep. 1. Or do something neat with his big lips besides basic lipgloss, like a lip ring or like a special lip color. Idk, I feel like heâ€™s one of the members that have had the most basic styling that hasnâ€™t ventured out much compared to others. Iâ€™m not saying basic looks bad, I just wanna see a bigger variety for him from official schedules and concepts (aka the styling the company decides on, not his own personal styling choices).",
    "reply": "lip makeup in kpop is at ice age levels of advancement it's not going nowhere the glossy tanghulu lips is the best we're getting and I'm happy with it. But maybe I'm just a munch I've been liking his styling like stage wise sweat was soooo nice but ig his makeup is pretty basic ðŸ¤” they've only experimented with his eyes like once for the crush showcase stage but that's it idk how they'd do a summer look on him just no Ricky bullshit plz"
