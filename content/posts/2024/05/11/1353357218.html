      <p>I get it's upsetting but is it rlly that serious that it would fuck up their rollout 😭😭 I rlly don't think it will just another day of a kpop company making a bad move we'll live. I feel like we give too much power to negative emotions when this is the norm of the kpop fan experience but that's crazy
