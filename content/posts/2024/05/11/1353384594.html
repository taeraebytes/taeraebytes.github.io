      <p>If Matthew wasn‚Äôt an idol he‚Äôd be such a good f*ckboy, and not the toxic frat boy ones but the progressive, left leaning ones that have emotional intelligence so they can easily make emotional connections but that‚Äôs almost worse because he‚Äôd actively choose to break hearts understanding the weight of his actions but proceed to surrender to his own selfish pleasure and ruin people‚Äôs lives.</p>
