      <p>Versace was in China too, but conflict of schedule. Fashion week is domestic, seoul/shanghai. Not those opulent cities like paris or london. His CBar has connections with organizers and was made aware of things. This list came out to pressure wk1 since there are rumors of cancelling Gucci because of Japan debut</p>

      <p>Actually, japan debut was just a coy. more like because they wanted Gucci to focus on Hanbin. Their attendance wasn't finalized until late and they weren't even on the guest list. when hao was sent to Gucci, Stacey made a fuss and sent Hao to Loewe too in the middle of japan promo. this was so unplanned. the funniest thing is that, wk1 asked Hanbin to go back to korea the same day just to MC when the two other MCs are present because they don't want hao to be the 'hardworking' one for flying to other countries to work.this is so funny.</p>

      <p>Why are you lying anon, only myungjae was there and emka staff came to the airport to receive hanbin, so it's most probably emka who wanted hanbin to be there</p>
