      <p>They should've done a highlight medley instead of an album sampler ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I rlly liked it I think that's the post chorus rather than the actual chorus

      <p>i feel the same about the vocals anon lmao so far everything has sounded really drowned out by the instrumental it's weird. but also i feel like all we've heard so far is gyuvin and obv he's not a vocal member so maybe that's why? unless i'm wrong and it hasn't only been his voice. everything else about it sounds fine tho</p>

      <p>you guys think the person in ftp is gyuvin? but yea the instrumental is way louder and the parts the chose to leak are like unclear? Which makes me think they're hiding the best on purpose unlike crush where we pretty much heard everything pretty early or they're doing some experimental switch
