      <p>Most dancers are lean because of that reason (dance looking sloppy/not sharp) actually. If you have muscles or some extra few pounds you would have to dance in a way that’s still going to highlight your dance lines. Matthew dance lines rn are really undefined because of his muscles. It’s also harder to dance when your arms are bigger than your head 😂</p>
