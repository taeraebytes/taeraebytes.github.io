      <p>Most dancers are lean because of that reason (dance looking sloppy/not sharp) actually. If you have muscles or some extra few pounds you would have to dance in a way thatâ€™s still going to highlight your dance lines. Matthew dance lines rn are really undefined because of his muscles. Itâ€™s also harder to dance when your arms are bigger than your head ðŸ˜‚</p>
