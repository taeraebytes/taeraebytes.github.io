      <p>we have to hit top 200 to even be eligible for nomination, we could somehow be 100000 points ahead but if we aren't in top 200 of any chart it is for nothing. that's why everyone is pushing for bugs and last minute donations because it is the only chart we have a chance in at this point</p>

      <p>i'm at work sorry yes it's weekly chart and we only have a few chances for wins so if we don't get on the chart it's over. if possible donate to @zerobase1_vt they are accepting donations for bugs downloads until the 18th at 1pm kst. our digital points are terrible and our sns points are lower than the competition. along with tiktok we need to keep posting on youtube shorts using feel the pop we aren't even at 500 videos and aespa has 2k+. just an extra if you can also please donate to @frombaseone because we are trying to get 1 more week of ads for the mv and they need more funding to do so this will also help us with our points</p>
