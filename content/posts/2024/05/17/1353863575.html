      <p>after it got announced a lot of people were bringing clips from the episode with keeho and daehwi and they were really sassy and this is the humor most kpop stans love, but matt and ricky were also funny, but just more wholesome</p>

      <p>Just in general being sassy with kids can get distasteful if ur not careful so why watch ur tongue the whole time?? They were natural with the kids and it was fun the feedbacks rlly good too

      <p>I feel like English content is a viral gold mine and it is sad that majority of the group can‚Äôt participate but they need to send them more on stuff like that even if that means only two or three members</p>
