      <p>Counting on yujin atp for the group to hit daebak maybe he'll get some of the gp to tune in bc of his pretty face and mc-ing with leeseo but idk, cuz clearly that mcountdow mc-ing aint doing shit we been in there for months. But then again what if some people do actually tune in bc of someone and then they see they're in the group that has the shibal guy and decide they're not interested anymore ..</p>
