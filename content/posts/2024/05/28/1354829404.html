Chris Brown's abuse of Rihanna is most widely known by the demographic who were teens/young adults at the time it happened.

      <p>pick and choose what???? I troll ab him being wokeðŸ˜­ well I do think he's more morally correct compared to most teen guys but he's an idol we're never going to know things like that about him. and I'm being realistic is he a Chris brown super fan??? he likes his music like most of the world unfortunately but why would he know his history he doesn't keep up with western entertainment and hes 19..ðŸ˜­ he was a child a korean born and raised child at that when the worst things about him were being broadcasted here in America like what??? and he's never serious ab his role models I don't think there's a single celeb he seriously looks up to
