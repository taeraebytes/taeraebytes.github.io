      <p>Probably not a popular opinion but don't you hate when idols (or shows) take recommendations for what they should cover and people suggest the latest iu song or some recent vocally not that challenging song they have semi covered in lives already!! Out of all the options ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Ok but anon we shouldn't mix two things up. Hes one of the best vocalists and has a lot of challenging songs but on the topic of covering songs, the title tracks are rather easy if you have a decent tone (candy, un village) or if you can hit a few notes (bambi). But yes, the ballads require more</p>

      <p>un village is actually difficult. I have seen a lot of idols try singing it but it just doesn't sound good when they sing.</p>
