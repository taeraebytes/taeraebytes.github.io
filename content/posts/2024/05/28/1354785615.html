      <p>who do you think is not straight in zb1? Like Hao is obvious, but the rest?
Well, Hanbin may be gay, but there isn't really any evidence except for his demeanor and dance style.
Ricky also has a rumor with an older guy, right? But I'm not sure if that holds any credibility, and if I remember correctly, you said that he has slept with some girl that you distantly know.

Taerae acts super gay, but I feel like he's that type of super feminine straight guy.
Matthew might be bi, but idk
and the rest seems rather straight (but oftentimes the most straight acting dudes are really not that straight)

Does someone have some more tea???</p>

      <p>taerae I agree he almost got me he rlly did but I still don't think he's gay ik some Tartar fan will come in here and try to slap me but he just seems to have an affinity for gay ppl TO ME and my friends agreed to like we're not convinced 🤷‍♀️

and hanbin hmmmm honestly if I never saw those predebut videos I wouldn't even think hes gay in the slightest like it's past being "obvious" nothing ab him pegged me as queer so that's why I think hes gay but there's a high possibility he could be bi as well like hao I'm sure is gay

And Matthew hmmmmm he comes off as bi but I don't think he'd ever go into a relationship with a guy and everyone else is straight to me

      <p>oh so that ricky rumor doesn't hold any truth to it? and Hanbin is so confusing, like gosh. Without his predebut stuff, I'd say he's painfully straight (like gf after disbandment, he marries quite early and has 3 children all before he hits 30 kind of straight), but I guess it could all be an act</p>

      <p>it's just that the rumor would be the only thing making ppl think I can't say if there's truth to it since I've never seen the post myself and it's still common to be in that dance scene as a man and still have a gf I'm just gonna label hanbin as queer in my head
