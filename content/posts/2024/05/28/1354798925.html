      <p>i think it's basically their valentine's day but how would they know that the gift is for hanbin? it could be a last minute birthday gift for ricky since his birthday is on 520. or maybe he was buying a little treat for himself lmao</p>

      <p>anon that anon is replying to here nopeeeeeeeeee i love haobin and bias both it's just we've really been in the trenches lately and also i felt like it'd be logical to question if it was for hanbin bc there was no Actual proof at the time lmao. now there's apparently stuff that points towards the stuff he was buying being for hanbin as mentioned in cc asks that queefy replied to later so i stand corrected (probably)</p>

      <p>she was the one who posted that video on twitter it was doing numbers in weibo and her clout chasing ass posted it on twt. she also dmed an actress that video and asked if the guy with hao is her husband, that actress denied it and posted it in her story and caused articles to be written about it. they constantly air out hao's predebut business stalk and harass his irls because she and her friends are fucked in the head like that. her alt account had a whole thread exposing hao's predebut life like his bf friends and all which even included chat screenshots and their translations. please don't just dismiss them as funny harmless trolls</p>
