      <p>ZB1 having no fanclub seats alloted in The Show today when they're supposed to win and it's Matthew's birthday. Hoping that other fandom would cheer for them. Wakeone is seriously frustrating</p>

      <p>Then get a new set of fans and tell them the rules... Why deprive them of fans when today is a special day? It's up to Wakeone to negotiate</p>
