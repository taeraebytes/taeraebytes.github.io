      <p>he's popular for a kpop idol in china and being the center I feel like a good chunk of his fanbase will leave once he's no longer the center

      <p>Yeah Jun and yuqi only started actively promoting in both when they became really big in sk, he'd need to have a stable group in SK for a few years before promoting in cn</p>

      <p>his fanbase is only big FOR a kpop idol and there's no guarantee a good chunk will stay if he goes into cent while being a mid flop kpop idol he's gonna be unstable ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

      <p>You anons underestimate the real reason why crosins stan him, hate to break it to you but i'd say half if not 75 percent of his cfans stan him because he is the 'center'. I'm being as blunt as possible so you can understand. They stan him because of his status as. a. center. The reason why they go crazy with buying his merch and streaming etc is so he can MAINTAIN that status. I don't blame you guys if you guys don't understand but I've been in kpop a long time stanning groups with c members and I'm into cpop and cdramas so I've seen how things work.

Cfans are like a cult, they worship their idols/ actors because they think they're 'God' or a 'deity'. And right now Hao is 'God' to his fans by being first Chinese center in a Korean produce show. Once ZB1 disbands and Hao loses his status as a center he also loses his status as 'God' to them and if you realistically compare him to idols and actors already in China he's mid tier if not a nobody. And cfans are full of ego and pride, who wants to support a low to mid tier idol who 'abandoned' their country to work in another country? I'm sure some will stay and support him like crazy as in his hardcore fans aka the 25-50 percent but it won't surprise me if the other 50 leave.</p>

      <p>GYATDAMN I don't think it'll be thatttt bad? I've had my hand in cpop but not that much so it is true he'll lose a lot but idk. I feel like if they rlly force him into cent for variety and small acting maybe a song he'll be fine but that's just the best case scenario in my head. But yea I'm not gonna be surprised if a large chunk leave and it's only gonna be worse if he continues to be an idol (or leaves yh and tries to continue promoting in Korea) and that's like a guarantee he's not gonna be the center or he'll share like 30/70 ðŸ˜­

      <p>depends on what country he's promoting in and I think someone said before the music scene isn't developed in China so he'd have to dive into other things
