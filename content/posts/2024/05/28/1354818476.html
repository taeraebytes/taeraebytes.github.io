      <p>he's popular for a kpop idol in china and being the center I feel like a good chunk of his fanbase will leave once he's no longer the center

      <p>Funny because he has a chance to hit big if he works in china with some yuehua help rather than debuting with with other yuehuaz in korea</p>

      <p>Yeah Jun and yuqi only started actively promoting in both when they became really big in sk, he'd need to have a stable group in SK for a few years before promoting in cn</p>

      <p>his fanbase is only big FOR a kpop idol and there's no guarantee a good chunk will stay if he goes into cent while being a mid flop kpop idol he's gonna be unstable 😭😭😭

      <p>You anons underestimate the real reason why crosins stan him, hate to break it to you but i'd say half if not 75 percent of his cfans stan him because he is the 'center'. I'm being as blunt as possible so you can understand. They stan him because of his status as. a. center. The reason why they go crazy with buying his merch and streaming etc is so he can MAINTAIN that status. I don't blame you guys if you guys don't understand but I've been in kpop a long time stanning groups with c members and I'm into cpop and cdramas so I've seen how things work.

Cfans are like a cult, they worship their idols/ actors because they think they're 'God' or a 'deity'. And right now Hao is 'God' to his fans by being first Chinese center in a Korean produce show. Once ZB1 disbands and Hao loses his status as a center he also loses his status as 'God' to them and if you realistically compare him to idols and actors already in China he's mid tier if not a nobody. And cfans are full of ego and pride, who wants to support a low to mid tier idol who 'abandoned' their country to work in another country? I'm sure some will stay and support him like crazy as in his hardcore fans aka the 25-50 percent but it won't surprise me if the other 50 leave.</p>

      <p>GYATDAMN I don't think it'll be thatttt bad? I've had my hand in cpop but not that much so it is true he'll lose a lot but idk. I feel like if they rlly force him into cent for variety and small acting maybe a song he'll be fine but that's just the best case scenario in my head. But yea I'm not gonna be surprised if a large chunk leave and it's only gonna be worse if he continues to be an idol (or leaves yh and tries to continue promoting in Korea) and that's like a guarantee he's not gonna be the center or he'll share like 30/70 😭

      <p>depends on what country he's promoting in and I think someone said before the music scene isn't developed in China so he'd have to dive into other things

      <p>cpop idol culture is kinda looked down upon in china. they prefer more ballad soft songs like singers like zhou shen or li ronghao. even at end of year events they rather invite actors to perform tho they sucj at singing instead of gettig some idols</p>

      <p>yess which is y a lot of cpop idols drift into acting bc it is SO HARD to book idol gigs. it’s either they start acting or they rebrand themselves as ARTISTS instead of idols. that’s kind of the only way to stay relevant in the industry there. unless you are the top idol group, u won’t be invited to big events</p>
