      <p>Can you blame them, thats the only time the group goes virals is when they sing acapella cause nobody is acc tryna listen to their songs. I think theyre under some kinda curse atp</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ everyone liked dash tho they entered melon for the first time w that I think they'll just be veryyyyy slow growers. and it's unfortunate but true they're behind on the visual game compared to the other ggs they only rlly have sullyoon jiwoos rlly pretty too but ppl make fun of her weight too often

      <p>Sullyoon cant do nothing for herself theres no saving that sister, shes not popular internationally, not controversial enough to get a hate train. She's very shy not a variety character, doesnt seem to want to profit off her looks or body.</p>
