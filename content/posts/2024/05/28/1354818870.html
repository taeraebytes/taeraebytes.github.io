      <p>Hao was invited earlier this year but WK1 rejected. I think it's for the 1st episode which was filmed end of March. Probably got invited again after WK1 approved Xiaoting then added Ricky like what they did with Gucci.</p>

      <p>Youth Periplous: The show that shows Hao's photo is a type of road trip show, a group of friends will travel to a certain location. 
Keep Running, basically Running Man in China. 
These are two completely different shows, with no similarities at all. 
Running Man you can shoot in a day, Youth Periplous you have to film for a whole month. Only stupid people would think Hao would go back to China to film that show, like the show is not even that famous,   Because popular shows invite domestic artists, but no one cares about this show so they take advantage of kpop fans</p>
