      <p>he's popular for a kpop idol in china and being the center I feel like a good chunk of his fanbase will leave once he's no longer the center

      <p>Yeah Jun and yuqi only started actively promoting in both when they became really big in sk, he'd need to have a stable group in SK for a few years before promoting in cn</p>
