      <p>i think it's basically their valentine's day but how would they know that the gift is for hanbin? it could be a last minute birthday gift for ricky since his birthday is on 520. or maybe he was buying a little treat for himself lmao</p>

      <p>anon that anon is replying to here nopeeeeeeeeee i love haobin and bias both it's just we've really been in the trenches lately and also i felt like it'd be logical to question if it was for hanbin bc there was no Actual proof at the time lmao. now there's apparently stuff that points towards the stuff he was buying being for hanbin as mentioned in cc asks that queefy replied to later so i stand corrected (probably)</p>
