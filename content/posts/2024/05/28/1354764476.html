      <p>No jun and yuqi got offers early on too, were saying if he wants to have a career in both countries it's better to wait to have a stable career in Korea before like jun and yuqi, notice nn focuses in Korea too and she's the biggest Chinese idol we've seen in years, having half half doesn't work</p>
