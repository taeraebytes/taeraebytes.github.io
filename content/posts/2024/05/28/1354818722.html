      <p>it really depends anon.

if haobin redebut both of them will lose the same amount of fans with hao probably losing more on the cside.

if they redebut in groups both of them would still lose fans cause of the zb1 disbandment debuff. hao would lose another potion if he isnt center of his new group.

if they redebut as soloists both of them again would lose fans cause of the zb1 disbandment debuff.

hao could stay afloat and keep most of his cfans (the ones that stan him beyond his title) if he focuses and redebuts in china (really unlikely) but that would make him lose kfans and intl fans.

if he redebuts in skorea he would lose cfans (the ones that cling onto his title, the ones that wanted him back in china) but not as many as if he were to redebut in china (intl fans and kfans wouldnt leave as much)

hanbin is lucky that most of his fanbase is korean. eb knows that he will keep working in skorea which is a plus because his fans rn can chose if they want to stan another idol/group or if they want to keep staying at his side (even after zb1). haos kfans dont have that knowledge and thats why he could be having more people that will stan him for only these next two years and then move to another idol/group. hanbin will still lose kfans and intl fans during his enlistment.</p>
