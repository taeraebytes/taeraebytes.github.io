      <p>No idk about casual kpop fans but when I look at gossip Chinese kpop pages zb1 are known as the lgbt group lol they talk about other queer idols too but zb1 kinda just has this reputation in particular I wonder if it's the same in korea</p>

      <p>Ricky's rumors were so tiny compared to them and the average fan does not know them and matthews rumor was eeeeven smaller and I was the one who shared it here cuz it came from my gc through a mutual in vancity😭 and I'm still skeptical ab it cuz thru another friend I know he had an ex gf for fact not a rumor I just dk the timeline. And I feel like bp was rlly only super queer for certain parts of the internet for me it wasn't and it was obvious that the producers were using them for intl views and that they were never gonna make it
