      <p>I think the safest bet would be Hao and I could see a tan actually fitting him really well he's the best choice considering Hanbin and yujin are toooo Korean and safe and the other members would get shat on badly</p>

      <p>Hao's skintone is weird. His face is darker than his arms and legs. His arms are whiter than Hanbin, Ricky and Taerae who I thought are the palest of the bunch. Hao's legs are also whiter than Hanbin's but from the neck up, he's like one of the darkest. His probably given the slightly darker foundation than his actual color. Also, he has yellow skin tint/undertone while Hanbin and Ricky have blue which make them look like paler from afar. But if you put their arms side-by-side, you would see Hao's glowing.</p>

      <p>I've seen them at an arm's distance in daylight, sunlight and artificial light and I would say that the palest member is Matthew actually, followed by Ricky, Hao who is slightly paler than Hanbin but as the previous anon said he is warm toned while Hanbin is cool toned, then Jiwoong, Taerae, Gunwook , Yujin and Gyuvin. They are all tanner than what most of their official and fansites photos would suggest though but compared to their staff and the average east asian male skin tone, they are quite pale.</p>

      <p>At an arms distance..? Tell me more pleeeeeeek and yea I can agree with this sentiment but yujin being the second most tan is surprising rhey rlly do not play ab giving him the wrong foundation shade
