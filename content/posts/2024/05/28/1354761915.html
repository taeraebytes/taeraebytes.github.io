      <p>I swear 90% of what we discussed here about jebies will never happen. who knows what they themselves actually want but my personal wish for hanbin to be a news presenter, he would be really good since his major was kpop + broadcasting ; lots of presenters come from broadcasting majors; someone please suggest him news presenter as future job, and he himself said in lmj service that before idol he wanted to be performance director, he will also be good at that due to his company, and according to pre-rec goers, he already works with the staff on their stage coordination and gives suggestions to members. when they go on the tour, he will also have more experienceÂ </p>
