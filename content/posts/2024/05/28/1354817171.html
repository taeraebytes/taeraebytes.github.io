yo only 500k from 1mil last time is insane. i already knew that they didnt have a big strong core base fandom but wow. looks like our cbars did well in not revealing their numbers cause i doubt that crosins would be able to buy over 300k-500k albums this time around. the new regulation really hit them and no the aespa cbars are not boycotting, they are doing the same thing as our cbars > not providing links</p>
