      <p>Allins slandering Hao's tutting when the guy probably learned the dance few days ago compared to Hanbin who has been doing the dance for 10 years now. And Hanbin has been wanting to dance Naughty with Hao since July last year, but Allins making it about Yuehua pushing Hao to dance with Hanbin. Hilarious af ðŸ¤£
