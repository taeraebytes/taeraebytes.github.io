Mercari imo has a bigger kpop selling market than depop but it doesn't hurt to post on both. Idk ab depop but be sure that ur page is visible on mercari and that you use acronyms if u mention another platforms like ig they're anal Ab thatðŸ˜­. their algorithms make it easy for ppl to find u tho so it's good use them first

I also suggest selling ig though I've never sold on there I think that's where the biggest audience is. Look through kpoptag accts ex. zb1tags zerobaseonetags zb1tagged and see how ppl format stuff. It's easy if ur a bigger acc and have like proofs and stuff so this would be harder but still try
