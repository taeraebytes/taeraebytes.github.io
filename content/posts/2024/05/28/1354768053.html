      <p>who do you think is not straight in zb1? Like Hao is obvious, but the rest?
Well, Hanbin may be gay, but there isn't really any evidence except for his demeanor and dance style.
Ricky also has a rumor with an older guy, right? But I'm not sure if that holds any credibility, and if I remember correctly, you said that he has slept with some girl that you distantly know.

Taerae acts super gay, but I feel like he's that type of super feminine straight guy.
Matthew might be bi, but idk
and the rest seems rather straight (but oftentimes the most straight acting dudes are really not that straight)

Does someone have some more tea???</p>

      <p>taerae I agree he almost got me he rlly did but I still don't think he's gay ik some Tartar fan will come in here and try to slap me but he just seems to have an affinity for gay ppl TO ME and my friends agreed to like we're not convinced ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

and hanbin hmmmm honestly if I never saw those predebut videos I wouldn't even think hes gay in the slightest like it's past being "obvious" nothing ab him pegged me as queer so that's why I think hes gay but there's a high possibility he could be bi as well like hao I'm sure is gay

And Matthew hmmmmm he comes off as bi but I don't think he'd ever go into a relationship with a guy and everyone else is straight to me

Taerae 50/50 I don't know at first I was he's straight but just catty but recently I've been doubting it so imma just say bi with no particular preference. 
Hanbin leaning girls, controversial? Idk like sometimes he scream gay but I really do think its just his dancing style/ demeanor because sometimes I see him next to Karina and he just seems so straight but then there are times where I see him looking at guys and I'm like hmmmm so imma just say bi leaning girls.
Matthew leaning girls idk why just the vibes, he never screamed straight to me. I feel like he's the type to accept anyone as long as they love him and show him affection. Been feeling that recently because he's so depressed lately it just gives me those vibes.

ricky, pretty sure all his rumors had no credibility just an anon on douban saying stuff during peak BP, unlike hao and hanbin his rumors never had screenshots or pics or vids so I think that says a lot about the rumor. Also wth is this random sleeping with a girl sneak? LOL first time hearing it in this cc and thats def aint true cuz the only 'source' we have is that yuri person on discord but some anon here said she's catfishing last time so... but if anything they were school friends who played games and she helped him with homework.

Gyuvin, had a gf so self explanatory. I know he does a lot of questionable stuff that can give the idea he might be bi but to me he just gives me mad straight vibes. I feel like he's just super touchy and affectionate as a person, I mean yeah he probably over steps the boundaries sometimes for clout but he straight af.
