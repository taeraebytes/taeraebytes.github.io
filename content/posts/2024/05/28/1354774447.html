      <p>I think they could have that smaller cult following like loona, if they get too big they'll get hated on bad while now pretty much everyone likes them</p>

      <p>kiof fans are the new loona fans except they're actually successful but I think nmixx can grow to be liked generally and become successful I don't need a loona curse on them no thanks
