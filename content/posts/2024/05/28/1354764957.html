      <p>who do you think is not straight in zb1? Like Hao is obvious, but the rest?
Well, Hanbin may be gay, but there isn't really any evidence except for his demeanor and dance style.
Ricky also has a rumor with an older guy, right? But I'm not sure if that holds any credibility, and if I remember correctly, you said that he has slept with some girl that you distantly know.

Taerae acts super gay, but I feel like he's that type of super feminine straight guy.
Matthew might be bi, but idk
and the rest seems rather straight (but oftentimes the most straight acting dudes are really not that straight)

Does someone have some more tea???</p>

      <p>taerae I agree he almost got me he rlly did but I still don't think he's gay ik some Tartar fan will come in here and try to slap me but he just seems to have an affinity for gay ppl TO ME and my friends agreed to like we're not convinced ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

and hanbin hmmmm honestly if I never saw those predebut videos I wouldn't even think hes gay in the slightest like it's past being "obvious" nothing ab him pegged me as queer so that's why I think hes gay but there's a high possibility he could be bi as well like hao I'm sure is gay

And Matthew hmmmmm he comes off as bi but I don't think he'd ever go into a relationship with a guy and everyone else is straight to me

      <p>Me and my gay male friend were talking about this and this is our conclusion keep in mind that we're more involved with the European gay community 
Jiwoong unpopular opinion but i wouldn't be surprised if he got with a guy, I see him as a straight dude willing to experiment but I wouldn't be surprised if he was some flavour of queer imo, my gay friend says he's superr straight tho lol
Hanbin queer, outside of his videos there's a lot of little stuffs that just make it obvious to us lol I wouldn't be surprised if he was either bi or gay but I definitely see him having a male preference, some flavour of queer Def
Hao gay but I could see him discovering he's bi too lol
Matthew I believed that he was bi but my friend thinks he's super straight too lol and Matt is his bias so I believe him
Taerae is a question mark but recently we've been leaning towards queer he reminds me of boo seungkwan
The rest all straight expect maybe Ricky who lived with 3 gay men at one point and had that one rumour but idk bcs he's very much giving xhs fuckboy not the gay archetype like hao</p>

      <p>Jiwoong is just straight to me even with his bl past but there had to have been smth to it ig and he doesn't play ab doing too much when it comes to queerbaiting but I agree with your friend more 

And hanbin I agree maybe it's cuz I don't pay close attention I don't see the bits but at the time of bp there was nothing but I agree he's queer but fully gay? i don't rlly get that vibe 

Hao I think is just gay I used ti kind of see him as bi with a heavy male lean but I think he's just a flirt 

Matthew I think is less of a sensual flirt than hao but nonetheless a flirt but I think he's straight too

Taerae rlly had me thinking and idky I just don't see him being bi so he's still straight to me ig 

And Ricky I say is straigjt because the rumor is the only thing that leads me to believe he could be bi and if he is I think he has a stronger lean towards women but I get what u mean w the archetype

everyone else straight
