    "question": "How do you feel about fans releasing fancams of spoiler perf like the haobin naughty? Probably unpopular opinion but for me it kills the hype so I prefer those written reviews or even a 30 sec teaser if they really want to spoil but the entire performance is too much",
    "reply": "I honestly don't care much so far only the haobin naughty cover for a lot of attention from leaks and I think in this particular case it was good to build extra hype. Like immortal songs was good when nothing got spoiled but that was for a month long wait we're getting this in a few days ðŸ˜­"
