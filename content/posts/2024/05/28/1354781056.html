      <p>I hate saying this cause I want wakeone to push gunwook next comeback but I wonder what will happen if wakeone pushed ricky, at least a bit more like top 3.

Icl I'm salty af but he really does have the ability to reach the gp and we so desperately need that right now cause of bitch ass jiwoong, we in the dumpsters... him casually getting 100k likes on jpn twt and trending on theqoo 3 times this week and it's positive??? I don't think any solo member or ZB1 as a group went viral the way he did on theqoo for positive reasons and theqoo is literally a good indication of korean gp opinions.

I'm just trying to be real and put my saltiness on the side cause I want the group to succeed and none of the members really made noise outside the fandom except for him and with positive feedback. Wakeone been pushing haobinjin but nothing is really happening, pushed guuvin matthew and bitchass jiwoong for sweat and crickets. And when ricky goes viral it's himself, unrelated to the group so I need wakeone to push him as a member of the group which will help the group. Just my thoughts, jiwoong making me so depressed 😔</p>

      <p>The moment they push Ricky more than Haobinjin in SK, he will be hated by the fandom of these 3. He will be dragged for his vocal, his dance, his makeup, his Korean, his attitude and he'll be called lazy who dgaf about his fans. Some Knetz would definitely pick these things because their ass love bullying people. Although, pushing Ricky might get the attention of a certain group of people (not GP) momentarily, but they won't tune in to ZB1's music unless they release a banger. Remember, Cha Eunwoo is the most popular idol but Astro flopped. ZB1 is surviving because of the core fandom which is composed mainly of Haobinjin stans. ZB1 needs to release one good song that will be liked by GP.</p>

      <p>Anon most of astros songs at the beginning of their career were gp friendly and actually really good. Nowadays and even back then nobody cares/cared about groups other than the big3 now big4. Even if ZB1 releases great music or easy to listen to music they will not get big because they have bombs in the group (ex. jiwoong, gyuvin, etc.). Astro had bombs too (Jinjin, Mj, later on Rocky).</p>
