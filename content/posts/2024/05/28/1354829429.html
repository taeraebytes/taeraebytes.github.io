      <p>Kpop idols are given till 30 (int) to defer their enlistment so even after disbandment he will only be 24 so he will have 6 years. That’s enough time to settle and stabilise his own fanbase so I don’t think enlistment will impact too much because by that point those who’ve stayed that long will probably stay.</p>
