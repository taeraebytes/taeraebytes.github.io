      <p>No jun and yuqi got offers early on too, were saying if he wants to have a career in both countries it's better to wait to have a stable career in Korea before like jun and yuqi, notice nn focuses in Korea too and she's the biggest Chinese idol we've seen in years, having half half doesn't work</p>

      <p>the reason ningning doesn't is probably because she had such a bad hate train when the olympics was going on and they always favored winter and karina more anyways so they would not give her a schedule to mess with the group's momentum</p>
