      <p>its late and prob late for everyone else here but i gen know nothing bout zico so if anons can help a homie out and briefly summarize for me to understand why this isnt good I'd greatly appreciate it cause i was actually so excited we got a ot9 gig after being jobless ðŸ˜­ like i thought this was our way back into kgp hearts and maybe with this show theyd stop giving a fk about jiwoong and give us a chance and the reason i think this is cuz spot is doing well on the charts so i thought k gp opinions of zico is really good ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>
