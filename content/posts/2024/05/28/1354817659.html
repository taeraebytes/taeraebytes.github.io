      <p>I believe the best decision for zb1 is to extend their contract. But if they still disband, i hope hanbin and gunwook pull sakura & chaewon card</p>

      <p>Not exactly for these two but i can see big companies trying to pull a besserafim and maybe pulling 2 or 3 members into a new group and i assume they will try and go for whoever is the least tied down and easiest to get e.g Matt hanbin Gunwook all come form companies that could easily be paid of for their contracts</p>
