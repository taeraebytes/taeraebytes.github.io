      <p>I believe the best decision for zb1 is to extend their contract. But if they still disband, i hope hanbin and gunwook pull sakura & chaewon card</p>

      <p>Not exactly for these two but i can see big companies trying to pull a besserafim and maybe pulling 2 or 3 members into a new group and i assume they will try and go for whoever is the least tied down and easiest to get e.g Matt hanbin Gunwook all come form companies that could easily be paid of for their contracts</p>

      <p>I was thinking what are the chances of mnh sticking Matthew to 8turn? the group is not doing horribly and if they added him it would give a boost</p>

      <p>I mean matthew can go ahead but if he has better offers like redebuting with a few zb1 members he's not going to 8turn and I honestly don't want him to go but I didn't forget their company snuck a zb1 sticker into an 8turn scheduler

      <p>Since their debut the company said that limelight wouldn't be a fixed lineup group and they they would be adding members so that's why no one is shocked about them getting added</p>
