      <p>yibo became that famous first bc of the untamed unexpected popularity, unless hao and ricky get on a drama that popular i dont see them having that much success over in china but anything is possible honestly but dont expect too much yall</p>

      <p>Also we won't see a danmei like this adapted for a while and hao can't get cast in a danmei for obvious reasons, but he'll also struggle in a het drama because of his accent 
Ricky I could see take the acting route but I doubt they will promote in China tbh his parents are millionaires (at least) living in the usa that usually means big scandal in the future if he stays in China</p>

      <p>even if he wants to be an actor, unless he has inborn talent he will have to work really hard, imo he has a idol singer face not actor face so there is a huge chance he will be typecast so if he wants to be a serious actor, i think it will be really hard for him</p>
