      <p>cuz ricky treats yujin as his equal. imagine being 17, constantly babied and infantilized by a guy barely 3y older than u, instead of just being treated as his other friends. ricky is also a chill american who doesn't really care for seniority culture in korea. idt he would care abt not being addressed w respect meanwhile fuckass jiwoong ðŸ’€</p>

      <p>Exactlyyyyyy I think gyuvins chilled out on it but for them it's more about the time they've had tgthr and being close from the start gyuvin aside I actually think yujins favorite is gunwook they hang out the most

      <p>true but he picked hb as the hyung he is most thankful towards (today from zicos show). i think hb even tho is always babying yujin respects him having his own thoughts and yujin seems to really appreciate that. its really not easy taking care of a teenager</p>

      <p>I think he babies him appropriately and they do have a 6 year age gap so it makes sense but I also think he respects him as a teenager
