      <p>Counting on yujin atp for the group to hit daebak maybe he'll get some of the gp to tune in bc of his pretty face and mc-ing with leeseo but idk, cuz clearly that mcountdow mc-ing aint doing shit we been in there for months. But then again what if some people do actually tune in bc of someone and then they see they're in the group that has the shibal guy and decide they're not interested anymore ..</p>

      <p>Hmmm... I think it was wrong that they packaged him as the good guy who can never do wrong. I think they were really aiming for Cha Eunwoo image. But for an idol in a group surrounded by funnier and more interesting members, he comes off as the boring lad and because he's the good guy, casual fans easily get disappointed whenever he does something out of the character they imagined him to be. He already lost fans when he became "straight" after doing all those predebut sass. They want them to do those gg dances like how Taerae and Hao do them. Nowadays, he's been acting out of his 'good guy hanbin' character towards some members & I think, someone should tell him about it</p>
