      <p>Counting on yujin atp for the group to hit daebak maybe he'll get some of the gp to tune in bc of his pretty face and mc-ing with leeseo but idk, cuz clearly that mcountdow mc-ing aint doing shit we been in there for months. But then again what if some people do actually tune in bc of someone and then they see they're in the group that has the shibal guy and decide they're not interested anymore ..</p>

      <p>i don't get these hanbin solos like they're like YAAAAASSSS my taste is so elite bc i ONLY like HANBIN out of zb1 and then they go and stan stale ass riize and tws (i know someone's about to say hanbin is boring please don't i bias him âœ‹) like ok so u clearly are not here for the talent and don't know how to have fun (it's just the achievements with these girls) tho we knew that. it's similar to when u see someone's stan list and it doesn't make sense to the ppl they ult bc it's either the difference between the ppl's genres/whatever is so crazy or they stan a great artist then shit from a butt. like i've seen so many ppl who stan taylor swift and stray kids yet their music sounds nothing alike and idk it just doesn't make sense to me so what is the correlation..... song writing and schizo stans?</p>
