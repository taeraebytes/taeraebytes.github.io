      <p>Hao being all "I love you guys" "Ill protect you guys" after his fandom and Hbs literally fought to death and probably still are is crazy too ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Its like they either ignore whatever tf is going on or they both secretly hate each other, there is no in between</p>

      <p>Eh I'm pretty sure he was referring to the saesaeng thing it really blew up and he talked about it right after, you guys need to search the evil in everything haobin say cause that's exactly why the fandom is like this rn clearly they're just trying their best</p>

      <p>It's funny to imagine him coming home late at night after a fansign and having his mnet chat being full of WE LOVE YOU ZHANG HAO and just being like damn what happened today ðŸ˜­but yeah he was probably trying to be reassuring there was another live where he was basically like you guys don't look at hate posts about me I'll protect you etc I think he's basically trying to tell them to just not pay attention to it all in vague terms his bangchan moment</p>
