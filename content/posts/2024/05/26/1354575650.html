      <p>Hybe didn’t do anything to Zico, they replaced some of the C-suite executives in KOZ. Zico founded the label but  isn’t an exec now, he’s one of their managed artists and prob acts as something of a creative director behind the scenes. 

Also this happened like 6 months ago and it just wasn’t confirmed til now so if we were gonna see changes we would have already seen them. Get off BND’s ass please 🙏</p>
