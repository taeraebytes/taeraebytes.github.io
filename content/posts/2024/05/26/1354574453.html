      <p>He used to be way bigger boys planet era and even now he’s somewhere in the middle tbh. Its just his intl fans presence is extremely low so i get why intl fans think that</p>

      <p>he doesn't have a core fandom or a lot of dedicated fans it's why he's always on the cheaper end for the pc market or low in engagements he's always been for casuals more
