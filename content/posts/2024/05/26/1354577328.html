      <p>members that will lose the most fans after zb1

1. hao and hanbin - like anons said it's true that a lot of their fanbase stans them because one used to be n1 during bp and a leader and the other one is a center , 1st chinese to win a survival show etc. their entire entire image built on being number 1 and "better than others" hence why their fans take so much pride in comparing them to other members and constantly re-establishing their superiority. but once we take out other members out of equation, or the haobin rivalry, they doesn't have anything special. for lot of these fans it's not abt them but abt being a fan of, what they perceive, best most popular member
2. yujin - many of his fans stan him simply because he's a maknae and will unstan him once he grows up. also he's bland asf and if it wasn't for wakeone doing active effort to make him stand out in their content, he would be unnoticed
3. gyuvin, matthew - both of their images are dependent on they relationship with other members, esp gyuvin. and matthew is riding that chronically english speaking member archetype so hard. he will be b.m 2.0
WALL
4. gunwook - I have seen people say they stan him only because of his image as the ace of the group
5. ricky, jiwoong, taerae - most people who weren't true fans have already unstanned them due to scandals, image change, broken expectations etc</p>

      <p>Agree a lot of why ppl can never wrap their head around why certain ppl act out this bad is cuz they actually don't care!

I saw gunwooks noona fandom exit in real time same will happen to yujin unfortunately ğŸ˜­ but his visuals are strong enough to keep majority around imo 

PLEASE NO I SEE IT COMING BUT I CANT HAVE MATTHEW BE THAT BASTARD ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and gyuvins fandom has already left by large what's left will probably stay since they're bonded to him but he'll still shed a good amount due to inactivity 

Yea the price of talent fans but he'll also keep majority his fandom is genuinely trauma bonded to him it's crazy 

Well yea jiwoong no fans and the other two are for casuals so
