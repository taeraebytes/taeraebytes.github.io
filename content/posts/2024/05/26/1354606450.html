      <p>not to be messy but i noticed that tweet about hao being stalked/harassed in belgium was posted very closely after hanbin addressed the stop eating thing which then caused rosins and allins to go schizo in hanbin and haoâ€™s mnet comments. like in the screenshots u can see the original exposing of that sasaeng happened april 24th yet theyâ€™re spreading it now and yeah itâ€™s terrible it happened but the timing is so suspicious like omg these girls know no rest</p>

      <p>I thought the same too I was like an entire month later ðŸ˜­? It does seem calculative it's just making this whole war so much more worse because of the timing
