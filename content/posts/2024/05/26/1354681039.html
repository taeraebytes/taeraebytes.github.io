      <p>ot9 zeroses are always only present at the scene after someone has been murdered acting all rightous and stuff. most of them ignore the bad things and talk only after the idol speaks up about something. the same thing with matthews ig comments, taerae saying sorry for the way he behaves and now hanbin saying he will be more careful. they are always late to the scene and thats why we have all these problems. they dont have a backbone or are scared to just say what they actually think. once something goes out of hand and eb seems to be on the same page, they start speaking. a bunch of pussies</p>

      <p>sometimes I wonder what fandoms you guys have been In before zb1.. generally that's how group fans move the only difference w zeroses is from the beginning there's always been a culture of hush hush no opinions sheep mentality. anyone who says smth out of the norm will get jumped by group fans and solos alike so rlly who can you blame and it's also about who you surround yourself with. big accts across most fandoms almost never go out of their content cycles so idk what ur expecting
