 u can see where his natural lip line is which has always been fat af but then the mua's also overlip past his lipline with lipstick to make it look thicker/ plumper

and then this is him without the overlip makeup

the last two links was last week on the 17 & 19th and anons link was their sweat performance on the 16th so if he did get lip fillers it should stay extra plump but it didn't because its makeup. sorry I'm just tired of being accused of getting lip fillers myself so I'm defending ricky no matter what.</p>

      <p>some funny balloon lore is that she used to be one of the biggest jiwoong stan accs during bp but she fell in love w ricky when she attended that pre-final fan meeting. she had to disguise herself as minamiz stan after this bc all her followers were jiwoong stans but it was so obvious that she doesn't fw him anymore and is completely enamored w ricky lmaaoo so she just suffered through it and then quietly dropped him after the in bloom era ðŸ˜­</p>
