      <p>he's popular for a kpop idol in china and being the center I feel like a good chunk of his fanbase will leave once he's no longer the center

      <p>obviously they're solos but it's just a common trend with survival show groups and he gained a sizeable amt of fans for simply being the first foreign center I'm not saying it's a solidified future but it's likely

      <p>Yeah as a veteran more than half are going to leave unless he got a good contract with good projects coming up and that's borderline impossible if he goes to China, also Hao doesn't have a super idol like personality if he goes to China and gets more socmed freedom he WILL be beefing with fans</p>

      <p>Honestly I don't even see him resigning with yuehua he seems pretty artsy and has character I could see him going to a smaller company or even leaving the entertainment world all together, he isn't built for cent</p>

      <p>Tbh I can see that I know he loves being an idol but so long as he's in yh i don't think he'll have the freedom to choose what he wants. smth smaller or just leaving all tgthr is what I've always imagined

      <p>That's what I think too but yuehua are rich asfk they might get him a salary he can't refuse..he'll be miserable if he stays in yuehua though it's not the right fit for someone actually artistically inclined like him</p>

      <p>agree I think they'll offer him a good cut too but I just don't see him enjoying it like the other possibilities

      <p>I honestly think he'll leave the entertainment industry after the contract end if there's no extension, this has been my thought since debut, I see him going back to teaching maybe staying in Seoul and occasionally releasing songs or covers independently but not very active</p>
