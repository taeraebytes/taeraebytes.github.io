      <p>Who said she isn't evil clearly she's crazy and should be in jail but she's genuinely gorgeous 😭it's even crazier cause she could probably get anyone if she wanted</p>

they fucking rich so they dont gotta work so their life is lowkey pointless because everyone else need to school/ work in order to function in society so theyre just tryna find the one thing to keep them going. I noticed rich ass ppl are always obsessed with one thing because its the one thing they have to keep them going so they always turn extremely physco over it and being a sasaeng is something they can do and there's a thrill to it which keeps their boring rich life interesting.</p>

      <p>But like if the idol seem uncomfortable and everybody hates you how do you not feel shame😭? I really need to befriend one and get into their head like remember when that one Hanbin akgae followed him and watched him close his lights? what do you gain from that and how do you have the confidence to post about it</p>

      <p>obsession is a dangerous thing, ofc they're semi aware too but I feel like they just rationalize everything to feel better about it. Also the whole tier thing probably plays into how crazy they are cuz I'm sure some just like being in proximity while others have motives

      <p>Honestly I can get people that pay for general infos but playing for their phone numbers and straight up following them everywhere is another level why are rich people all mentally unwell</p>

      <p>Yeah idk how much I can say cause I don't have their consent but the last thing I was updated on that was insane is there a weird company that several huge American celebrities invested in and the CEO that us written on the legal document claims that he's homeless and hes been drugged and force to be the ceo of that company, i think it was a crypto thing in the British government or something, wild stiff</p>
