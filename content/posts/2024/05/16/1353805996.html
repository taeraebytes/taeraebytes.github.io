      <p>Well, don't forget fandoms of other members sent the truck against hanbin's mc job and shinemeongddocat so I understand why allins are annoyed by zb1's frequent guest appearance in mca waiting room</p>

      <p>where’s the relation between those things… trucks were sent cos he was the ONLY member getting schedules while we couldn’t even get a glimpse of the rest. despite what y schizos think, Hanbin doesn’t own mca. Mnet and cj own mca.  You know what else cj owns? fcking wk1 and zerobaseone. That’s the fcking relation</p>

      <p>You are right about everything else, but that anon was talking about the second time the trucks were sent, not september truck, i have realised recently that a lot of zeroses still have bp mentality, a lot of you actually don't like hanbin from the beginning so many things he has to endure feel nothing to you, no wonder he looks so burnt out, overworking, antis hating him for literally everything his voice, appearance, his mere presence , his mom being sick, and he himself being sick occasionally. </p>
