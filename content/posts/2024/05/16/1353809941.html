    "question": "Groups that are domestically famous only have high digitals, but low physicals. Groups that are usually internationally famous only have high Spotify and MV streams & physicals. ZB1 is neither. They don't chart in domestic charts and Spotify & MV views are too low. They can easily be suspected of inflating album sales. Well, I do think that some of the sales came from nonfans who are just sellers. Hao pcs, for example, are selling like hotcakes.Even if some of his fans don't buy the album, they're buying pcs from sellers. The reason why his digipacks and pobs are always sold-out.This is why physical sales alone isn't a good indicator of a Kpop group's popularity.",
