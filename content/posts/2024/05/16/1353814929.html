      <p>cause they got nothing else to do🤷🏽‍♀️ it seems unlikely yeah but honestly i could see it happening
jellyfish - milking dayeon for more money and the could do the same for gunwook
matt - literally what is he supposed to do
jiwoong - he could stay for more money too until he has to enlist
taerae - already in wakeone
hanbin - could see him doing it only bc he wouldn’t want to split up</p>

      <p>ok if 4 members were taken out of the group and two very important members to their fame at that, I promise you jellyfish and thel1ve would pull out immediately because that would cut the profit margin an insane amount. they'd rather make a buck without going through wakeone first because now good profit is pretty much gone
