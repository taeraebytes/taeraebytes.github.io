Sometimes when theyâ€™re quiet and not locked under a thousand snow app filters for their pics they look so good ðŸ˜­ when you compare them to other idols theyâ€™re actually pretty handsome, which is even more annoying that their personalities are so afhdfghb that it prevents even more fame for the group. Like maybe I AM FOR companies forcing personalities on members. Imagine a quiet but respectful Jiwoong and a mature and calm Gyuvin, the group wouldâ€™ve had 1/4th the amount of scandals they currently have smh",
