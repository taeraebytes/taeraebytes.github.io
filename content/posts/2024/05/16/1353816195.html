I think that’s one of the reasons why we have so many akgaes/solos. BP and BTS are the only groups that come to mind when I think of groups that have little to no group lives anymore and guess what... these two groups have alot of solo and akgaes (more than groups who do group lives). ZB1 Global Fanbase should do E-Mail/Post templates for stuff like this. W1 listened to fans telling them to remove the Coke short video, we can achieve things like this, if everybody cooperates.",
