      <p>Well, don't forget fandoms of other members sent the truck against hanbin's mc job and shinemeongddocat so I understand why allins are annoyed by zb1's frequent guest appearance in mca waiting room</p>

      <p>whereâ€™s the relation between those thingsâ€¦ trucks were sent cos he was the ONLY member getting schedules while we couldnâ€™t even get a glimpse of the rest. despite what y schizos think, Hanbin doesnâ€™t own mca. Mnet and cj own mca.  You know what else cj owns? fcking wk1 and zerobaseone. Thatâ€™s the fcking relation</p>
