      <p>matthew kfans have been going too far recently, the constantly keep bringing up his bp, and pre-crush era clips and pics trying to express sadness over his image change. they said they dont mind him excercising but they dont like how its his whole image, and how he doesnt really do cute concepts anymore. which i totally disagree he just cut his hair and theyâ€™re mad about itðŸ’€</p>

      <p>It's the hair he's bald and it's dark so it just accentuates it the muscles are pretty easily hidden under clothes and I get it I miss his long hair too. Also he's lost a lot weight his face is skinnier
