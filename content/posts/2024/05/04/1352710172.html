      <p>even kfans were mad globalz were left out yall need to start listening to people's complaints and stop the wakeone glazing for a second because it disrupts the peace of your fandom experience. do you know how BAD it is for KOREAN fans to call you out on xenophobia? lmao</p>

      <p>oml.... nobody dismissed anything but it's a pr article about promo for wakeone, they listed active promotions and didn't only leave out the foreign line jiwoong who they love wasn't listed as well because the 4 of them aren't in active promo. Again we don't know the intent but seeing as how there's also an easy work around explanation I'm not sweating it. Sure you can be upset nobody said u cant but I'm not gonna be and I'm not gonna waste my time dwelling and discussing. If you want a space for that go visit or create one like I'm gonna move how I want at the end of that day

      <p>girl most of those kfans are either solos/akgaes or not actual kfans. alot of them are kfans cosplayers. whatever they wrote in korean doesn‚Äôt make sense, they obviously used some translators üò≠üò≠ no normal kfan cares about this article unless they are a lil dumb in the head</p>
