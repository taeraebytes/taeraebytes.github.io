 they kinda deserved that block ngl. why are you posting shit like that on the platforms where the members most likely would see it? it makes no sense. mind you most of the boys are getting their offers blocked by wakeone not just hao. if wakeone were to allow this fan to continue posting shit like that other would follow and we would have eb using the app to put in complaints and not love for the boys</p>
