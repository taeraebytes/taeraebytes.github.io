      <p>Versace was in China too, but conflict of schedule. Fashion week is domestic, seoul/shanghai. Not those opulent cities like paris or london. His CBar has connections with organizers and was made aware of things. This list came out to pressure wk1 since there are rumors of cancelling Gucci because of Japan debut</p>

      <p>Nah if I were Wakeone I would not respond to any of Zhbars Mails just because they are turning a group of fans against me and my decisions. Talking with organizers for info is crazy. Fans should stay in their places as fans not managers</p>

      <p>the way zhbars treatment is pretty exact to the other bars but it just looks a certain way because of their updates. For the reaching out thing if it wasn't zhbar it was gonna be another fan reaching out to orgs is pretty customary but it's almost like they post ambiguously to incite negative reactions 🤦‍♀️
