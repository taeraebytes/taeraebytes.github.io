      <p>I didn't know about this but I've been feeling like Matthew has been a little off lately, he seems confident so I hope he won't take it personal but it sucks that they're so.. upfront about it😭</p>

      <p>Its because he’s veryyyy online. Like he mentioned zerose jail, an active account on twitter that posts kinda weird stuff😭 I genuinely think he has a active acc on public, and has moots and things like that. And sadly he might see negative things on the tl, like trolls set ups which have been going on a lot for him recently since he blew up on Popbase or that other acc</p>
