      <p>Versace was in China too, but conflict of schedule. Fashion week is domestic, seoul/shanghai. Not those opulent cities like paris or london. His CBar has connections with organizers and was made aware of things. This list came out to pressure wk1 since there are rumors of cancelling Gucci because of Japan debut</p>
