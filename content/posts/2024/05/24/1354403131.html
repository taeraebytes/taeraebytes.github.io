      <p>I asked my friend who knows nothing about kpop what she thought of the encore and she said "it was okay but the high parts were too high and out of placed" and then she asked to hear the actual song and after hearing it she said "oh if it's supposed to be that high it was pretty good some people were bad tho" (she oofed at yj and jw's part ðŸ˜­)

I think the high bits, falsetto or w.e idk the term just sounds out of place if you don't know it's supposed to be that way ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Giving falsetto to the members who can't be in the key even in their comfortable range is suicide. Wakeone is trying to massacre ZB1's career so bad. The sudden change in music during Crush and now the vocal drag because of the unnecessary falsettos given to the vocally weakest members.</p>

      <p>But even hanbin and taerae were struggling with the falsettos and they're the 'strongest' vocal members. It's seriously just a range issue.</p>

      <p>it's funny whenever you say something about vocals with confidence even after you said you don't know anything about vocals because haewon is the 2nd best vocalist in 4th gen (male and female combined)</p>

btw the whole ranking shit comes mainly from "sootzubÃ¦ [ cth ]" on YouTube (and others like BAZISSINO or Zeke). They use KVA like most Kpop stans it's not 100% accurate (not based on actual empirical vocal science since you can't really rank vocalists based on that), but it makes it easier to compare vocalists

I myself do not fully agree with KVA</p>
