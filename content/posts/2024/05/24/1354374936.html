      <p>노래에 리듬감이 안 느껴져서 더 못하게 느껴짐 제목이 필더팝이고 가사에서도 계속 팝팝팝 이러는데 너무 얌전하게 불러 대체적으로 소리 잘 내는 멤버는 있는데 리듬감까지 챙길만큼의 실력으로는 안 돼 보임 그래서 무난하다 못 한다로 말 갈리는 듯

I feel worse because I can't feel the rhythm in the song. The title is Feel the Pop and the lyrics keep saying pop pop pop, but they sing it too calmly. In general, there are members who make good sounds, but they don't seem to be skilled enough to take care of the rhythm. So I say it's okay or not good. It seems like it's splitting apart

i'm kinda agree with this comment on theqoo</p>

      <p>I understand. Its not a terrible song and its main point is that it is catchy. But it lacks a good hook, the chorus is very flat and same tempo as the rest of the song. The verses and the rap are monotone too. In comparison Crush was very dramatic throughout the song, so even if its not your style with the noise, it follows a good flow where you can appreciate some parts. Ppl here said in bloom was too safe too, but the chorus ( both melody and lyrics) is very overwhelming and of high quality, credit also to the good choice of sample.</p>
