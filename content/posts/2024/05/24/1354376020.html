      <p>I think Matthew is really having a self esteem problem these days. He‘s beating himself over the encore to day too, said on live he was nervous so he ddint do well when he rlly did better than yesterday to an untrained ear (me) and when ppl complimented him he said that he‘s not handsome… it‘s rlly sad seeing him like this i hope it‘s just me looking too much into things</p>
