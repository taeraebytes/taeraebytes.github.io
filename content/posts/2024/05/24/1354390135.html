mom is full taiwanese chinese but she naturalized so thats why her mom is considered 'fully' korean but her dad didnt naturalize and explains the wonyoung being 3/4 korean 1/4 taiwanese chinese rumor. So if her mom didn't naturalize she's actually 3/4 taiwanese chinese 1/4 korean or fully taiwanese chinese yall this is crazy  

장원영은 혼혈이 아니에요 아버지는 대만화교 어머니도 대만화교에요 어머니 혼자만 귀화하셔서 국적을 한국으로 바꾼거뿐이에요 그러니 혼혈은 아니고 순수대만 혈통이지만 한국에서 태어난 한국인이이에요~</p>
