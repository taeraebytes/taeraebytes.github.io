      <p>It's been a week since the songs are out, I just wanna share my opinion on the title track and want to know your thoughts as well!

I actually really love crush, yujin's intro is too good and I love the instrumental....but ftp doesnt have that factor like it's too monotone? Even though in bloom was a bit monotone as well, it had a good bridge, a great last chorus and outro but feel the pop lacks that one or two parts that are super catchy like personally I've had songs that I don't like that much at all on 1st listen but there will that one specific part that is super good and I go back to listen just for that and eventually like the song....like prev anon said, ftp sounds too safe. I feel their bsides were way better in this album. And another anon copy pasted a cmt from a forum sharing an opinion how nothing is really 'pop' about ftp and I agree, the chorus atleast should have been a bit explosive? Idk how to convey um I hope you understand. then you already discussed line distribution with anons but yeah ! I hope they just improve next comeback like they know that pots and pans like crush is no no, and too basic of a song like ftp is also not...find a balance wk1. And pls fix your mixing, it's still lacking (Its so long sorry ðŸ˜­)</p>

      <p>me too me too idc I will never trash crush any if I had control of zb1 ID STILL MAKE THEM DO IT MI NUH CAREEEE I'd probably change up the chorus but still. And agree the potential for the chorus was really there it's catchy although flat but it could've been such an attention grabber and ultimately everything else falls so averagely. I like the bsides on their own I feel like mini album wise I still like the yits composition better. AND CAN WE PRAY THE SWING MERGER TAKES US TO HEAVENNNNNNNNNN

      <p>should've mentioned properly that the bsides are better than the title track this time, for me too yits is still their best album! This album lacks cohesiveness. And swing was the one managed izone right? Their concepts were great.</p>
