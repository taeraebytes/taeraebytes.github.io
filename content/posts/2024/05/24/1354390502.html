      <p>y‚Äôall can prefer other members vocals but he is the best technique wise and no matter how many people cry and disagree it won‚Äôt change unless the others get their ass in the practice rooms like he has been doing. next</p>

      <p>he is the best technique wise yes but what makes someone the "best vocalist" is not just that. a lot of ppl dont like his tone (more suited for ballads in my opinion that's why a lot find it boring), he doesnt sing live as much as you'd think he does (i was surprised to find out matthew sings live more often than he does! especially in their feel the pop stages) and also he's not the most stable live, ntm he tends to strain a lot when he belts so yeah "best vocalist" is debatable, no one's saying he isnt a great vocalist tho</p>

      <p>I think the thread is getting into vocal technicality and addressing vocal ability since they're getting dragged so idk it's fitting they'd call taerae the best vocalist here. Ik singing live is important but it's also a stamina thing but hey

      <p>taerae does sing live a Lot and many good vocalists rend tend to skip singing live sometimes to avoid damaging their chords especially it's a high note which again taerae has a lot

and speaking of straining in belts first of all again it's not a LOT and second of all no one in the group wouldnt even be able attempt the belts that taerae does in the first place except for hao maybe and even then debatable so how exactly is this argument supposed to prove anyone in the group is a better vocalist than taerae? and the tone arguement is tired yawnnn it has no place in vocalist discussion go listen to enhypen if u care so much about tone anon</p>
