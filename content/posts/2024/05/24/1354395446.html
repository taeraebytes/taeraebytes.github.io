rosins, allins and mulbokdans are all buying views. acting like your fandom is not is foolish. i gotta give it to mulbokdans since they just newly started buying views. before that yujin was third to fifth (with a huge gap between second place) when it came to fancam views.

i would stop worrying about fancam views because they can be messed around with by subfandoms and actually worry about our mv views so the boys can get more wins < but this doesnt fullfill solos/akgaes greed and egos, so fighting about fancam views is what we are stuck with.</p>
