      <p>Keita fans think he is the shit when he is 5'6 can't rap and is worse at singing than jiwoong ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

The delusion some of these eliminates trainees fans have is insane</p>

      <p>fuck no japanese bp watchers hated him they wanted hiroto but there was this famous japanese utber who told all his stans to drop other japanese trainees and to only vote for keita because he was the most 'skilled' and theres no way tehres gonna be more than 1 japanese trainee just by looking at top 15 and hiroto was already 19-20 so theres no point in wasting/ splitting votes because then there would be no japanese trainees at all in the final lineup.

when hiroto was out japanese bp watchers were pissed and honestly yes some still voted for keita in the finals just because they wanted a japanese trainee but a lot more j nets were like fuck that shit do u see him compared to everyone else? hes short af and ugly af and only ruining the japanese image so j nets voted for other trainees they actually liked and dgaf about race which was surprising. keita got votes from savior complex international fans who pitied him for being short and ugly and from a failed group. 

its also why despite not having any japanese member zb1 is doing so well in japan because japanese fans actually like the members they voted for despite race/ ethnicity which is commendable and i love them for that</p>
