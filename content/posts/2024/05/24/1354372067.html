According to reports, former idol members A and B were a same-sex couple. The damage the agency had to bear was too great to have the two most popular members of the group leave, so they just watched. What's even more shocking is that Group A and Group B got into a love fight at a music broadcast, causing a schedule disruption. There was another incident as well.
