      <p>AGREE! I think one of the reasons tbz blew up a lot was because they literally went live every other day for hours and just tweaked in front of the camera. like it's so important for fan connection and creates so much lore and vitality you feel like you're actively part of something, like I'm so involved in zb1 but I feel like my cc is the only thing that keeps me connected it's so bad everything is separate and behind paywalls
