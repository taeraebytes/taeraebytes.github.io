      <p>I was stanning yujin earlier but I stop stanning him realizing I'm stanning a fucking robot he lacks emotion I have never seen him crying or getting emotional, he is not able to fulfill job of maknae, like maknae job is to cry that mf never shed a one drop of tears.</p>

      <p>Yujin just seems like he doesnt want to show his real side on camera i mean this in a good way, he could change but maybe its his real personality. I realised a lot of ppl say yujin linking his shyness to somethings bc hes a maknae while i just think he finds a lot of idol things cringey</p>

      <p>I don't think he's necessarily hiding his true self he's just just more timid on cam, which understandable. I think he's definitely been more comfortable in front of the camera as of late
