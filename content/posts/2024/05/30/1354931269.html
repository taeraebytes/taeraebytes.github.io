      <p>The way whenever hao gets a schedule you and your anons start tweaking and making up 46562 arguments about why he shouldnt get it is crazy to me especially how that's never done with the other members</p>

      <p>I love how y'all just lie 

My very first reaction to the confirmation was verbatim "okayyy" then someone asked if it would become a regular thing to have missing members to which I said "I mean unit solo stuff has been prioritized over group content from the very beginning" VERBATIM. I can keep going tbh there's so much more. someone else said but it's at the expense of a group schedule I said "true well it's a good opportunity so why pass it up for some festival" please go ahead and fact check me ho there's so much more BECAUSE WHY WOULD I CAREüò≠üò≠??? Even my anons were chill like..

And yup just went back this conversation about hypothetical missing members started from this cc "Hanbin eats up Thursday for himself and Yujin Sunday. ZB1 adjust their schedules according to the MCing schedules of these 2,  but other members aren't paid, of course. So, Ii don't think it's wrong for other members to have side hustles too because Hanbin has been doing it regulary for 8 months now..." I know y'all like to twist and make shit up but don't ever try to make it sound like I've ever cared or participated in ur victim Olympics. Like please save the whole "yall never do this with other member" spiel "it" (ngl idky discussion bothers y'all like nobody said you have to be here I'm always gonna operate how I doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) happens to ever member like how coveninent I've heard that sentiment FEOM EVERY FUCKING FAN MEMBER HERE JESUSüò≠ idky it's coming to a surprise that in the grand scheme theme of things the one thing id care ab is a constantly missing member (minus jiwoong) LIKE IM A STILL A FAN

wow now I'm irked as fuck I HATE WJEN PPL LIE LIKE DID U PPL EVEN READ
