      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>I’m more curious as to why the brands are contact the cbar instead of the artists actual company ? Like am I the only one finding it weird this sort of information isn’t going the management first. And then what the cbar just emails wakeone like btw here is an offer for hao.</p>
