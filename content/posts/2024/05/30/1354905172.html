      <p>It's also the fact that they skipped a group schedule for a Chinese schedule. I saw so many people doomposting that hao will leave Korea for sure amongst kfans and this is the Chinese idol stereotype so a lot don't like, I also think it's too early for Chinese schedules personally they should focus on domestic fans🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>Yea sorry I didn't care he was missing from two youtube videos and no one's being fake concerned like I wonder do u guys read or not like what😭😭??? This started because a hao fan wanted him to miss group stuff for schedules and that's when ppl started saying rosins would tweak out if anything was ot8 and also I'd rather he not do a back and forth in a temporary group SORRY? Y'all kill me getting hot over hypotheticals
