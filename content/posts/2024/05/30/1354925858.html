      <p>funfact, some c-mullbokdans actually stan him because he's a maknae. maknaes are usually spoiled, crybabies and bratty (just like sehun). But Yujin isn't like that at all so they keep pushing their yujin princess agenda on him and they even hate hao for being a spoiled bratðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Nah, otherwise rapmon, jihyo and many other leaders would be popular in japan. Itâ€™s more to do with cuteness and contrast between looks and image that is popularity in japan.</p>
