      <p>y'all acting like rosins started this out of nowhere is what's killing me definitely not because some anons were trying to stir shit up and saying it's not a good look and why would they do that and trying to give fifty arguments why it shouldn't happen well suck it up because it's gonna happen anyway you can keep discussing it tho 🧏🏽‍♀️</p>

      <p>1 this is the first conflicting performance zb1 have had 
2 it's such a big and common stereotype let's not act like when Chinese idols do work in China ppl assume the worst 
3 this is an anonymous discussion/gossip forum anyone says what they want 

and yet everyone is surprised and shocked like I'm lost do you know where you are.. and ngl yea the member missing thing started from rosins that stuff came after the fact. my issue is simply ppl lying and telling me how I feel and what I said then trying to place importance on some dumb shit wdnc😭 don't ever worry I'm always gonna do me this isn't the first or last rodeo LOL
