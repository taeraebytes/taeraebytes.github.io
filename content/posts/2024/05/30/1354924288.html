      <p>It was because she posted an update like she does every week about the mca live guest and this week it’s treasure and zerose can’t hold their mouths so they started dragging treasure in the qrts and them some temus started dragging Ricky. She just deleted the post eventually and said if you qrt hate your getting blocked because miss girl was just posting her lil update and a whole fanwar was going on in the qrts</p>
