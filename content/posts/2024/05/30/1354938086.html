      <p>Isn't it because they have this weird delusion that CRosins will mistreat other members. Since they're big, they might get the majority of the slots and other members would have few fans cheering for them.</p>

      <p>Yea but that's not the case everyone got cheers at Hong kong and I watched xhs videos for their hitouch for the most part it was good there were times were like taerae or matthrw would get ignored but I think it's cuz they were placed next to hao/yujin I forget which but overall received very well everyone got love
