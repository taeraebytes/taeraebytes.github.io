      <p>I know it and on my life I wonâ€™t tell anyone sorry queef not even you and Iâ€™ll be the first to drag an allin but this isnâ€™t something started by them this is something that got picked up by c fans that obviously werenâ€™t careful about what they were talking about. I doubt they will talk about this though because if they wanted to they definitely would have by now they are all just nosy bastards like most of us lurking here so itâ€™s better they keep it between the like 4/5 of them that do know.</p>
