      <p>As someone who reads a lot of docs
Haobin have proportionally to their numbers a lot of quality docs, I do get annoyed by the characterisation sometimes and the very fetishistic way Hao in particular tends to be portrayed but I can look past it of it's well written and it's usually at least less heteronomativr than
Gyubrick they have a lot of well written fics but I do not like the popular characterisation at all Ricky is either a damsel in distress or straight up mean both don't make much sense, they need to have some goofyness and both are the most Guys guys there is you can't take that away from their dynamic 
Mattwook I'm alright with most mattwook fics but a lot of them make Matthew into a baby princess which pisses me off if anything gunwook is the princess there and it feel a lot of time that gunwook could be switched by any other bigger guy, Matthew is three years older and it must be felt</p>

      <p>agree I don't read haobin or gyubrik but with their volume there should be some quality and yea it's down to how they characterize cline it's weird and for mattwook it's alright half the time but gunwook is so replaceable they only ever flesh out matthews character and even then it means too much into this baby princess character he doesn't have and ur right like gunwook is clearly the shyer younger emotional guy so idk ðŸ˜­ but sometimes they make him too emotional where it gets one sided I'm kind of over fics anyways like zeroses cannot be normal ab rps and it gets weird too quick
