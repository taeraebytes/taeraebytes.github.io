      <p>funfact, some c-mullbokdans actually stan him because he's a maknae. maknaes are usually spoiled, crybabies and bratty (just like sehun). But Yujin isn't like that at all so they keep pushing their yujin princess agenda on him and they even hate hao for being a spoiled bratðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Nah, otherwise rapmon, jihyo and many other leaders would be popular in japan. Itâ€™s more to do with cuteness and contrast between looks and image that is popularity in japan.</p>

      <p>I think another anon mentioned this before but heâ€™s been having a steady increase since the final like he got way more cheers at Kcon Japan than I expected considering he was really low in the 1 pick there, but his popularity there really started taking off once they opened bubble and he started doing bubble lives. Like Iâ€™d say September- December time most of his really big hit tweets from the jside were clips or moments from his lives because like anon said just fans really liked the more cute playful side he showed in lives in contrast to the leader image the were seeing in public content.</p>
