      <p>I saw some Rosins talking about shows invites rejected by wK1 early this year, 1 is RM which apparently invited Hao the same time as that Travel show, but Zeroses called them delusional. Now, it's apparently true. Among the ones listed, the fashion week rejection is the only one waiting for confirmation. Why do Zeroses think that Rosins are lying when the info are from CBar that has a direct contact with the shows, events and brands. I'm really curious</p>

      <p>Girl zhanghao of zerobaseone didn't get invited to fashion week 😭 and someone informed me of that rumor months ago and lets say there was some universe he got invited it got rejected because of yura yura like there's usually reason behind rejection this show would've taken weeks to film he's a temp rookie

      <p>I don’t get the logic of rosins thinking every single offer he gets will go through. If that were the case you might aswell stan a soloist and even then because of scheduling it doesn’t work. They are in a group which means. 99% of the time solo and unit schedules don’t have to fit just one member but also work around group stuff too. If hao went to every job he got offered he’d be missing from a lot of group stuff and then yall would complain about ot8.</p>

      <p>bit of a tangent but idg how there's so many akgaes in kpop yet there's maybe 20 ppl who stan Actual soloists and 18 of those are iu stans like 😭 akgaes a lot of the time are just stanning for the success and to put others down so truthfully it doesn't even matter who they're stanning but wouldn't they be a lot happier if they actually stanned someone who worked solely on their own and did not interact with group members at all yet none of these ppl seriously seek that out and instead invade COMMUNAL, FRIENDLY spaces? and u could argue "well it's about who they stan they just love this person so much" well then grow to tolerate the other members at least? bc they stink up the facilities BAD like idk it just comes off as unmedicated mental illness to me. stan a fucking soloist since u love that career path so bad</p>

      <p>Its because they are addicted to the fights, toxicity, the achievements they cling to as if its their own. I know this because i was in jungkook akgae twitter. Interacting with akgaes make u understand these people really seek entertainment and fulfilment through being mad and bragging. This is why true solo artist outside of a group will not have as much crazy fans</p>
