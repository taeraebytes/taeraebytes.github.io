      <p>I have the feeling that with the way they keep posting pics about concept picture clues, the real tea is that they find the Pinterest of stylist/creative directors and they leak their shit from there. That creative director that did illit concept has their profile public since a long time ago and they have entire boards about concepts ðŸ˜­</p>
