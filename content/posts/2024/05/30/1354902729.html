      <p>It's also the fact that they skipped a group schedule for a Chinese schedule. I saw so many people doomposting that hao will leave Korea for sure amongst kfans and this is the Chinese idol stereotype so a lot don't like, I also think it's too early for Chinese schedules personally they should focus on domestic fans🤷‍♀️</p>
