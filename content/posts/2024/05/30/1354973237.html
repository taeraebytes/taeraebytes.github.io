      <p>From the vibe Iâ€™m getting itâ€™s not something allins â€˜startedâ€™ itâ€™s something thatâ€™s being said on the kside but obviously something slipped through because despite them being really hush about the popular members one of them saw something. Afaik one person said they knew something in a cc and sent it to the cc owner but they havenâ€™t shared with anyone else and if Iâ€™m completely honest I donâ€™t think they will spread it either because even they know nothing good is going to come out of them getting themselves involved in a rumor. As of right now it just seems like this cc when someone sends you a rumour but asks you not to post it and then everyone suddenly becomes 10X more curious.</p>
