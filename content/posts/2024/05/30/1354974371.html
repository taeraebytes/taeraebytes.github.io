      <p>It's also the fact that they skipped a group schedule for a Chinese schedule. I saw so many people doomposting that hao will leave Korea for sure amongst kfans and this is the Chinese idol stereotype so a lot don't like, I also think it's too early for Chinese schedules personally they should focus on domestic fans🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>speaking of wakeone not being smart... we know zb1 has to have another korean cb before the tour so the kfans don't lose it about being abandoned for foreigners and allegedly theyre already working on a cb but why do i have the feeling that it might be a japanese cb instead of another korean cb 😭😭</p>
