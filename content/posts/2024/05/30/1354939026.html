      <p>matthew is definitely not a kpop stan especially during early zb1 you could tell he didnâ€™t even know a lot of the big hits but obviously he learned after being surrounded by a bunch of kpop stans for over a year. he definitely did like jay park as an artist tho i mean he auditioned with his song ðŸ˜­ but his sister did clarify that he only liked his music and was aware of the fact that heâ€™s problematic and doesnâ€™t support him like that (something along those lines).</p>

      <p>how do you go to the other side of the world to become a kpop trainee without being into kpop ðŸ˜­ but ig maybe thatâ€™s why he only really knew about the succesful ones that were making bank and wanted that and didnâ€™t realise the chance of him debuting in a nugu group and not even paying off their debt during the active time was much highe, but in the end the cards played out in his favour with zb1</p>

      <p>i read this on someoneâ€™s retrospring but i lost it so take this with a grain of salt but they said matthew met a japanese dance teacher in canada in 2019 who had connections with hybe so thats how he got into kpop and being a trainee. i think he had always been passionate about dance and so after he didnâ€™t really like college he decided to pursue that opportunity</p>

      <p>wasnâ€™t it the dance director or akin to that at hybe Japan? what is funny to me is how he declined first and then when uni got too difficult or boring he said let me hit them up ðŸ˜­</p>
