      <p>I dont follow the kside so did kgpd's ever complain about Gunwook bulking/ working out or gotten too bulky? I feel like with his proportions it's way better to be lean bulky instead of just straight up lean twig</p>

      <p>They think it's careless styling like his physical is putting in more work than the actual clothes

      <p>Also I've noticed a LOT of his k and j fans really favor how he looks when he wears fitted clothing and all skin completely covered up like in KTL (co-signed üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). The sleeveless shirts they usually give him are so shapeless and basic most of the time too, not that they're all bad but it gets old because most of the time those shirts only highlight the biceps, which aren't even his best feature, and kinda obfuscate the rest of the upper body.</p>
