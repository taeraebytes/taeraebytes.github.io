      <p>3. more ot9 schedules

even ot9 fans act like akgaes with the way they talk about mistreatment like i've never seen a fandom like this..... if this was any other fandom ot9 related shit would've been complained about ages ago but ppl only ever focus on the individual like this isn't a kpop GROUP and not a bunch of soloists who are somehow always together. convinced i'm the only person who likes the members</p>
