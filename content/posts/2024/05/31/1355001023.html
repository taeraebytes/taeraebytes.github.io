      <p>tbh the automatic translation on the phone works surprisingly well on postype? I read multiple fics on postype this way and understood about 95% of it - also the characterisation part is so true kfans really know what's up I also noticed the thing we complain about often (treating members like damsel in distress x strong meaty alpha (gyubrick in 90% of ao3 fics) generally doesn't seem to be a thing on postype the characterization is usually spot on, one time I even read a fic of two zb1 members with half of it being canon like it was crazy</p>

      <p>Knowing the language probably helps there was this canon compliant haobin fic that kinda turned into a mattwook fic that was written by a Korean speaker and it felt very realistic in it's dialougues</p>
