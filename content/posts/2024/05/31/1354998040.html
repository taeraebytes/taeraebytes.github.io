      <p>Hmm but I'm seeing some cfans saying yuehua might be open to cooperate ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” either way I wonder if the yuehuaz already signed an artist contract with yuehua, if they did that would complicate things 
What is sure is if they cline no matter what yuehua promise we will never see them in Korea again</p>

      <p>this is the first time yh has had their trainees make up half the group and also have the most important member so I feel like in some way there could be cooperation. I'm not sure if just the Korean branch would be involved or both but we'll see come 2025
