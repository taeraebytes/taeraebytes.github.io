      <p>bruh my tiktok for you page shows literally every kpop group under the sun so i saw some of the riize recording booth videos on there...... these men are interesting vocalists i'll say that. u could debut a fucking hyena under sm and it'd get the best vocalist of _th gen title just bc it's under sm</p>
