      <p>when are these "always" instances bc i keep seeing ppl say this in cc yet the only thing i can think of was that sweat performance behind where he said something like "you just ate tho?" when hao said to lift him up or something i don't even remember the context. not the best thing in the world but ppl keep saying this is a recurring thing and i've never noticed it despite watching nearly all their content</p>
