      <p>I actually think taerae is one of those rare cases where he has skill and tone because remember when he blew up for his one line in hot summer? ugh wakeone needs to cater some of their songs to his tone and stop giving him high notes and adlibs only ðŸ™„</p>

      <p>I just watched his cover posted in zb1 YouTube, this guy is a ballad singer through and throughðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's missing that training to make his voice more palatable for kpop that sm vocalists get but hes definitely not showing off what he has now</p>

      <p>vibrato is basically um the vibration you heart in belts kenxkekf i don't know how to explain it u know the pulsation in the voice whole belting like you mentioned you hate ahyeons singing because she's not actually belting there is no vibrato there is almost no technique she's just screaming and she can do it because her natural vocal range is quite high 

but here's a good example of bad belts vs good belts to understand what vibrato is

      <p>Oki listened to the video and yea I can see the difference and I think I can tell the difference between a good and bad vibrato I just don't have the vocab. I don't think taerae lacks it he might be more decent but he's definitely not a bad belter

      <p>Taerae defo lacks vibrato, because he can't end off his singing well he kinda styles it out by lowering his volume or putting his mic away. If he had better vibrato he would be even better than sohee</p>
