      <p>wallahi hanbin cannot be serious about gunwook's fancam being the weakest knowing his peers. i think hanbin must have high expectations for him and him only orrrr he's was abit too ashamed of who it actually is (GYUVIN) knowing that it'd make things awkward so he chose the scapegoat</p>

      <p>Hanbin clearly doesnt give him any kind of constructive criticism that's why he's still shit at singing shit at dancing, because how on earth are you gonna make fun of taerae's dancing, basically body shame matthew and say gunwook made no progress but only say "he has to adjust to some moves because he's tall" about gyuvin? okay mr unbiased pro dancer ijbol</p>
