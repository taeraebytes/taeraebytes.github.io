      <p>I actually think taerae is one of those rare cases where he has skill and tone because remember when he blew up for his one line in hot summer? ugh wakeone needs to cater some of their songs to his tone and stop giving him high notes and adlibs only 🙄</p>

      <p>The songs barely cater to the group he's cooked

      <p>right like they’re not the best vocalists ever but making non vocalists sing majority of “harder” parts and giving them songs that not bot suited to them at all hinders their potential to be more respected vocally and shine as a group 😒</p>
