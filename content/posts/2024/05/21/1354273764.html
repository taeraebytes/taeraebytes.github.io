    "question": "Instead of cuddling the boys, just tell them to improve their vocals. They agreed to this arrangement, they should have worked hard to deliver them. Esp Yujin, Ricky, Jiwoong & Gyuvin. They were given those lines that would have been better sang by Hao, but Hao sang the pop pop instead which could have been given to the weak singers. I mean, you can refuse if the notes are out of your range and ask for other parts. People who have no self-awareness are the worst kind. I'd like to believe that even the people in the recording studio are tone deaf too. This is about to be a worse comeback than Crush. They will be buried if they don't improve with their encores. I'm seeing KZeroses who are telling them to practice and that they shouldn't have won and did that embarassing encore. If this continues, we will lose some people in KSide again.",
    "reply": "okay what does that have to do with anything..? like I'm confused who are you talking to cuz there's no coddling???? It's pretty objective that the encore was average we've discussed what was bad what was good and if anything this group is too hard on themselves the fans are too hard on them nonfans are too hard on them antis are too hard on them LITERALLY EVERYONE IS TOO HARD OF THEMðŸ˜­??? I WISH THEY WERE CODDLED BECAUSE THEY GET HATE FOR BEING AVERAGE I'd be more understandable if they were hated for bad moments but they get hate for small slips or an average performance it's quite sad if they're not amazing they're not worth grace. Of course they should always improve and I rlly hope they take every criticism but let's not act like they don't have to work three times as hard as their competitors they're held at a super high bar compared to their counterparts"
