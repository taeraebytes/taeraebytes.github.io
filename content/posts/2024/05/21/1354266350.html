      <p>Whatâ€™s funny is that I see a lot of Kfans say that they should stick to the in bloom line distribution for zb1. I think that feel the pop line distribution is so weird like why do you have Ricky and Yujin singing a high pre chorus. In my opinion pre chorus shouldâ€™ve been sung by taerae, Hanbin, Hao, Gunwook and honestly letâ€™s just stick to giving one line each to gyuvin, jiwoong and Yujin. I know we hate uneven line distribution but you canâ€™t give equal amount of lines to people who can sing vs people who canâ€™t</p>
