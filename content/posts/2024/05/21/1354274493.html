      <p>My thoughts after watching the encore several times, i woke up when people started dragging them so i thought it was horrible just for it to sound very decent:

Taerae: stable as always, nothing too outstanding he never gags me when they sing live but still pretty good ofc!
Hao: delievered like always. the best live singer of the group very obviously at this point
Hanbin: stable and decent, was struggling a bit with his higher parts but nothing bad
Gunwook: pretty decent, his pitch still gets a bit shaky trying to go up but got significantly better from their last encore
Matthew: he was pretty stable! i was surprised he improved so much the only thing that can annoy people is his super nasally tone which stands out more when there's no editing/raw vocals
Ricky: disappointed me, it wasn't terrible but he needs to stop being overconfident in that weak falsetto it's honestly embarrassing to witness. find a more comfortable range
/the worst three/
gyuvin: well he's gyuvin i wan't expecting much but i will say he did improve a bit
yujin: less mc-ing more vocal training! i feel like he has potential but at this stage they should also stop giving him many lines??
jiwoong: pissed me the fuck off never sing again.

Although it wasn't as bad as those losers on kpop stan twt make it out to be, zeroses need to stop with the "vocalbaseone" and all members can sing corny ass agenda because that's a big set up and it's also part of the reason antis troll them so much.</p>
