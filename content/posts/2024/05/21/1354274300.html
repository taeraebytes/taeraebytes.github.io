      <p>I asked my friend who knows nothing about kpop what she thought of the encore and she said "it was okay but the high parts were too high and out of placed" and then she asked to hear the actual song and after hearing it she said "oh if it's supposed to be that high it was pretty good some people were bad tho" (she oofed at yj and jw's part ðŸ˜­)

I think the high bits, falsetto or w.e idk the term just sounds out of place if you don't know it's supposed to be that way ðŸ˜­</p>
