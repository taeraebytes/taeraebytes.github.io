      <p>its ang, i'll set the record straight ; i'll sum everything up. his first bbl after the situation happened, he then followed up with saying it wasn't me, so don't worry. it blew up much worse than the initial swear thing, and worse of all it was the night before the hanteo awards situation. so a lot of ppl used it as a way to wrap up the things that happened and it stuck</p>
