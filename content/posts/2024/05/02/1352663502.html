      <p>WAKEONE, The company behind ZEROBASEONE makes a bold statement. 
‚ÄùThere is potential to be a big5, and we believe we are the fifth member. 
I-LAND 2: n/a will produce a permanent girl group for the label with the help of The Black Label, a former YG subsidiary, while the first season was with HYBE. Now fully under the WAKEONE label instead of HYBE, there is great potential for WAKEONE to produce a strong group.
This group along with a potential permanent ZEROBASEONE, will make WAKEONE a stronger contender in the 5th generation than JYP, SM, and YG. Even HYBE only have two top groups in the 5th generation.
WAKEONE is a label on the rise

This made my dayü§£ü§£</p>

      <p>do you guys think there's actually a possibility of them making zb1 permanent? i feel like wakeone would actually want to, but it's a matter of companies wanting their trainees back. but maybe after seeing how past post-survival show groups have fared the boys' companies would rather get their cut of their trainees promoting with a big company with a lot of connections vs. take their chances making their own boy group, doing everything themselves only to flop and not make a return on their investment. like for jellyfish this froot is familiar they know all too well the survival show hype rarely carries over to new groups and the success stories are very few and very recent... i dont know i feel like this whole time i didn't even entertain the idea of a possible permanent contract because no other mnet group has done it before but the conditions might be right for it this time</p>

      <p>wakeone would kill to keep zb1 ofc but yh having 4 trainees isn't gonna miss out on the opportunity to generate more profit for themselves theyll try to snatch them. and imo hanbins company is gearing arounf making him theyre star they'll want him back too
