      <p>WAKEONE, The company behind ZEROBASEONE makes a bold statement. 
‚ÄùThere is potential to be a big5, and we believe we are the fifth member. 
I-LAND 2: n/a will produce a permanent girl group for the label with the help of The Black Label, a former YG subsidiary, while the first season was with HYBE. Now fully under the WAKEONE label instead of HYBE, there is great potential for WAKEONE to produce a strong group.
This group along with a potential permanent ZEROBASEONE, will make WAKEONE a stronger contender in the 5th generation than JYP, SM, and YG. Even HYBE only have two top groups in the 5th generation.
WAKEONE is a label on the rise
