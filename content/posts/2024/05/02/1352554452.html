      <p>I actually get annoyed when they do this like the only complaint Iâ€™ll accept was the mp dark photoshoot where they fucked his eyebrows but other than that you guys are basically just saying you find the other members pictures nicer to look at and thatâ€™s why you blame it on non issues for being bad</p>

      <p>Yeah I generally immediately don't follow and side eye accs that go by their SF instead of the group fandom cause they're usually toxic, especially rosins, allindans obviously but also seokryus, woongdeongies andmulbokdans imo yes riyangis are annoying but they're generally not toxic</p>

      <p>I mean it was somewhat inevitable these fandoms existed before the group but definitely we could've been in a different reality if things happened differently from the beginning

      <p>oh brother 

1. Rosins (NEW) they really believed the schizo expose thread on me... IM NOT ONE OF YALL!!! Arguing w me more and more overall schizophrenic behavior has risen. Somehow the worst crop have found me recently I just cant at least I used to find it a little funny when allins would wage war on meðŸ˜‘

2. Allindans. The beef is century old and goes deep and they stalked me and harassed me for months but you know what they've chilled out. And it's not cuz of blocking I've blocked more rosins and taerae fans also anyone that just send a death/rape threat im not that liberal w blocks

3. Kultaeraes. GO BE SOMEBODY ugh like who is beefing with a taerae fan bruh. Sorry there's like 5 ppl who have irked me so bad I cant forgive it 

4. Wdgs. Schizophrenics and stan jiwoong 

5. Riyangis. They've chilled out but slow af and annoying af. They've put themselves in a mental prison so I guess they had no choice but to be that way. Kinda like them now they haven't annoyed in me a long time actually and might join the lit crew soon

9. Everyone else, seokryus mulboks gpds and gyuvinists don't annoy me. like seokryus on twt mind their business and they just have a ki here. Mulboks have always been quiet and I have a few cute anons. gpds can irk but that's cuz of gunwook they're nice but never annoyed me + #favoritism I enjoy talking ab gunwook more than anything so I have fun w the ones here. and gyuvinists we overcame the engarde beef and became bffs and the gyuvin anons here are probably the funniest I like them the second most tbh
