Jiwoong is Drake without the bangers: ft ass, a little crazy, paranoid, sassy, none of his friends like him
Matthew jcole: he's cool w everybody and he don't wanna get involved
Hanbin metro boomin: hater in the shadows, doesn't rap but produces all the anti jiwoong songs
Hao Kendrick: jiwoongs biggest hater and is generally agreed upon to be very talented
Gyuvin Rick Ross: he just wanna get involved and is a troll and also hate Jiwoong
Ricky The weeknd: artistic just wanna get involved  but not too much since he's not a rapper
Gunwook Asap half involved, he just didn't like that jiwoong talked about his bm and is there to flex and be pretty
Yujin SFW future sneak diss but mostly here to drop some fun club bangers</p>
