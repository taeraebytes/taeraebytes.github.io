      <p>Actually let's all just make shit up maybe something will spread. Apparently gyuvin is crushing on a 4th gen famous female idol and flirted w her but she has a bf and they're planning to fight some time soon before the cb but gyuvin is scared and had been telling every staffs. He's bringing gunwook for back up and Hanbin for moral support</p>
