      <p>oh my god so on yesterday’s content zb1 were commenting on taerae’s “weird” fashion and so taerae asked fine what do i need to throw out gunwook and gyuvin asked taerae to throw out this cap cuz it had a tuna on it (per gunwook) they were laughing so bad taerae was defending the cap like what’s wrong with it only had an M on it looks fine i wore it to dance practice when i feel good for the day. turns out it was a fan gift 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

the screenshot: wow my heart breaks.. in the content 8 members were shitting on the cap that was given by a fan…. or should we feel touched that taerae was defending it?

so some quoted the tweet why are you saying 8 people were shitting on the cap when it was only 2 (gw and gv) some others were saying they probably don’t know it was a fan gift do you think they shit on it knowing that?</p>
