      <p>Saw a comment on PC that ZB1's a&r guy (company rep that manages artist/music direction and recording) is the same guy who directed Itzy's comebacks after Wannabe (@/sun_anr on ig). That brother took a group who was at their peak and who everyone liked and literally destroyed their momentum and good will forever. Zeroses need to turn their truck-happy psychosis on him because the group is actually fucked otherwise.</p>
