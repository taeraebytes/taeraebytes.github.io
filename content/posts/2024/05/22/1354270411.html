    "question": "This is why I always think distributing lines based on skill is still important! Like yes, give the part to a member whose voice suits but will they be able to sing confidently? I watched that encore and was thinking why the hell Ricky and yujin are singing the pre chorus? Should have been gw and hao along hb and tr. And as usual the bridge should have given to Ricky..... jw and gyuvin should have lesser lines (like 2 lines max) And yujin can either start the song or end it, any more than that is a big no! I personally really love hao's tone, but I just realized he doesnt really have many vocal parts, it's all pop pop popping ughhh",
