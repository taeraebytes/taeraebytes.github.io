      <p>I asked my friend who knows nothing about kpop what she thought of the encore and she said "it was okay but the high parts were too high and out of placed" and then she asked to hear the actual song and after hearing it she said "oh if it's supposed to be that high it was pretty good some people were bad tho" (she oofed at yj and jw's part ðŸ˜­)

I think the high bits, falsetto or w.e idk the term just sounds out of place if you don't know it's supposed to be that way ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>Giving falsetto to the members who can't be in the key even in their comfortable range is suicide. Wakeone is trying to massacre ZB1's career so bad. The sudden change in music during Crush and now the vocal drag because of the unnecessary falsettos given to the vocally weakest members.</p>
