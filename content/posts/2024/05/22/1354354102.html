      <p>I actually find it weird... This show was shot weeks ago... Taerae could have told Gyuvin and Gunwook offcam about the cap being a fan gift & that it would definitely look bad if it will air. WK1 could have requested KBS to do some editing to change the narrative. And of all people, Gyuvin and Gunwook were involved... Is WK1 trying to create an issue? Those Hanbin reviews on the fancams are scary af, esp Gunwook, Taera and Matthew's. And I noticed that he didn't give feedback to Yujin and Hao who coincidentally didn't talk much and just used their introvert cards.</p>

      <p>This is more the idol human theatre editing team who probably just took the footage and thought that the segment was funny. I saw other ppl mentioning the fact that he was quiet on yujin and hao it could be partly that they have large domestic reactive fanbases but idk idt it's a big deal but if that's the case ugh
