We getting praises üôèü•∞ honestly tho not even trying to dick ride them they all did really good and I didn't even notice until I read this thread but for yujin and rickys part they coulda sung the low register ver but they sang the high ver which is crazy that means they confident and we only gonna go up from here, they're all gonna be more and more confident and u can tell some were a bit nervous which is understanble cuz everyone and there mama judging encores cuz of lsfm.  Only haters I saw were rice ofc and gg stans doing too much but it was like a few and everything else were praises from other groups ü•∞</p>

      <p>Tbh I had suspicion that a lot of ppl mad esp on theqoo were stans of other groups who probs got hate, or straight up don't like zb1. Cause there were a lot of comments bringing up music quality or saying why don't they get hate like lsfm or I'll it. Anyways it's not that bad let's wait a day hopefully this mini reaction blows over</p>
