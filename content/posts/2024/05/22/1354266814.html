      <p>"Hanbin clearly doesnt give him any kind of constructive criticism" do yall want to see gyuvin cry THAT bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ eb in that room and the viewers know that hanbin went easy on him. there is no other way. you can see it in gyuvins face after hanbin was like 'you are bad at going down since you are tall'. he looked kinda relieved hanbin stopped and only mentioned that ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ somebody get dozen gyuvin out of the group. its insane how bad he still is. he should be waking up and sleeping in that practice room.</p>
