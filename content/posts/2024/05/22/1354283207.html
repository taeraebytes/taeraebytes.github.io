      <p>"there's definitely no need to use those weak falsettos idgi" well we would have to tell the producers that cause those falsettos are originally in the song too. i personally never liked falsettos and will never like falsettos so i noticed these really quickly in the song and it made me wonder.. why? like why are you making a song thats high and then make some parts of the song even HIGHER ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it makes no sense. i get they were going for a summer/refreshing/fun song but cmon. they are not a girl group to be having to hit those notes</p>

      <p>I think they're not placed well I notice zb1 do a lot of adlibs in their music and they just feel carelessly placed but they're usually good live the key is just mmmmmmm idk weird sometimes
