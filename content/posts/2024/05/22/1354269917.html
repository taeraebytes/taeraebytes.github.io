      <p>I actually think taerae is one of those rare cases where he has skill and tone because remember when he blew up for his one line in hot summer? ugh wakeone needs to cater some of their songs to his tone and stop giving him high notes and adlibs only ðŸ™„</p>

      <p>I just watched his cover posted in zb1 YouTube, this guy is a ballad singer through and throughðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ he's missing that training to make his voice more palatable for kpop that sm vocalists get but hes definitely not showing off what he has now</p>
