encore actually pretty good and falsetto aint even bad? Is it just me? imo I just feel like it shouldn't be standalone though, it needed someone else to sing the lower register to harmonize and accompany the falsetto like in the the song but the song is weird because I think the first falsetto part was ricky but he was singing both the low register harmonzing with his falsetto when it should've been split into two people because how is he going to sing both low register and falsetto live? I mean the reason the song is arranged like that is because it sounds good that way so it's bad planning/ arranging on wakeone/ producers part. For example in the encore when ricky was singing the lalala zero pop part near the end in falsetto and gyuvin was harmonzing in the low register part (backed up by hanbin) it sounded good.

You can tell some members were nervous though because even taerae sounded offkey during his falsetto right after yujin's falsetto which was honestly the worst out of everything but he seemed really nervous so I can't entirely call him out. No I take it back jiwoong was the worst I don't like his technique or tone. But a decent encore and pretty good encore tbh</p>
