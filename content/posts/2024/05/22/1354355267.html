      <p>I just watched the full encore today and its so goooood, yujin sounded so much better with his first verse and u know he took the criticism seriously because he put his hand to his ears so he can hear his own voice and they adjusted the falsettos parts where its not only one member singing it anymore so it blended in and they all look so much more comfortable and were dancing around 😭❤️❤️❤️

Honestly I thought they'd be more nervous today and a bit depressed/ low energy because of the negative feedback (tbh it wasnt even that bad) but they're not and they were the exact opposite which makes me so much more proud of them because they actually listened to the feedback and adjusted their performance for better results like I'm so fucking happy right now. They proved the haters wrong in ONE day and they proved they aint no sensitive ass hoes 💪💪💪

Gyuvin was cracking me tf up tho icl 😭🤣🤣🤣 his voice cracked in his i feel it part and then when the encore was over he kept trying to sing it LMFAOOOO</p>
