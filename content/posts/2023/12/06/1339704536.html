      <p>yup but something probably happened on the kside, there hasn't really been any hate post of zb1 on pann aside from the mama after party one but a lot of ppl called bs anyways. Like if they were literally so desperate they turned off their ig live to go there to 'hunt' why tf would they post pictures on social media ðŸ˜­

but either posted by hanbin akgaes or riize fans or chinese hating ppl (saw a comment that said "i hate chinese ppl" with upvotes ðŸ’€) is my only conclusion</p>
