I'm not chinese so everything is from google translate but apparently the 1st pic of a big block of text is op saying how she loved him from day one, how much money she spent on albums for a chance to see him by not buying purses and even not paying her bills and how she wanted to look pretty for the first time in her life because of him only for him to flip the screen or make her screen small so he's the big screen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 

then the second vid u can see him poking something on the screen and ig its the button to switch screens LMAOOO they're shitting on him cause he didn't even try to be subtle about it and third vid i think is them trying to say he's not paying attention and going on his phone on the side then a bunch of album receipts ig. Comments are shitting on him but some yj fans are saying theres a notification pop up or something so he closed it. but ngl the switching screen is funny LOOOL</p>
