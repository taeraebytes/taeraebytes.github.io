      <p>yeah? just because their dynamic is more flirty doesn't automatically mean it's a bait. some friendships are just like that. gyubrik isn't even popular of a ship for him to be doing all that</p>

      <p>anon what do you mean their dynamic is more flirty? rickys doesnt even play into that, gyuvins trying to do all the work because he knows fans go crazy for moments like that. he obviously wants what haobin have (popularity wise)</p>

      <p>nan ricky does play into it but just not nearly as much as gyuvin does. for example, during their bubble live together where they watched rickyâ€™s fancam, gyuvin tried poking fun at ricky for looking at the floor as he was performing by asking him if he saw a bug crawling on the ground or something like that. then ricky responded by saying he was looking at gyuvinâ€™s butt. gyuvin was like my butt? and then they just carried on watching. flirting and bickering is definitely their thing.</p>

      <p>It takes two people to make a ship they queerbait durr but recently gyuvins just doing way too much it's weird and I never saw them as flirtatious you can tell they bicker and that's their thing but idk if youve ever heard two guy friends talk to each other they talk a lot ab butts that's just what teenagers do it was bearable when they'd just amp up the cat and mouse thing this is just nasty now

      <p>As much as gyuvinist want this to be blamed on Ricky itâ€™s not happening, thatâ€™s a singular joke that heâ€™s made with like all the members (the ones heâ€™s close with at least) while gyuvin acting straight Yandere just like how Taerae was to him</p>
