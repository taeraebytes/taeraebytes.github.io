 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...

      <p>i have a suspicion hao doesn’t fuck with jiwoong at all abd it’s kinda mutual,  hao just either looks so done with him most of the time or ignores him and even in their jeju episode of jw’s show their interactions felt very forced 😭</p>

      <p>The jeju episode was odd and they're kind of weird with each other they play up to the cameras but they're so standoffish most of the time and that whole episode was just Chinese tourism anyways

      <p>there's also a video from the bts of that performance that it's like a 360 cam of them singing, and during one part hanbin and jiwoong were talking about how they had an argument and then gunwook or ricky (i don't really remember) was like since hanbin is younger he should apologize first, and hao face during the whole thing was so funny he was annoyed as hell, and then hanbin went for a hug and the other members were watching but hao didn't want to even look at that, he only stared at them when hanbin said something during the hug sjsjsj. he really can't stand jiwoong fr</p>
