      <p>i find it so funny how everyone is so convinced that haobin are real when they follow the same formula as every other kpop group and they swear it‚Äôs different w them but that‚Äôs what literally every kpop stan says. like without fail every group has that one pairing composed of the 2 most popular members and zb1 is not the exception</p>

      <p>eh, a lot of times idols rise in popularity bc of ships... luhan-sehun did that, taehyung-jungkook too. there's other ships on where yeah they are getting shipped just bc they are the two most popular members like yeonjun-soobin and karina-winter but imo for haobin they became popular bc of the ship too, when the ship started hao wasn't in the top 2 of the most popular, it was jiwoong</p>

      <p>ü•±ü•± in korea your ship can be popular if the ‚Äúshippers‚Äù are also popular, karina winter/haobin and gyujin/chanbaek/nomin/taekook/wonyoung yujin, etc. it will help their popularity, but first they have to be popular too. look at matthew and taerae, none of their ships are popular..</p>
