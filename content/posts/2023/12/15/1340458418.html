      <p>gyuvin saying he's happy when ricky's unhappy like what the fuck does that even mean even my fujo oomf was confused. why is gyuvin's fanservice (idk who he's servicing but i prefer to think it's fanservice) now catered specifically to the toxic yaoi fans</p>

      <p>of course that he's saying that to cater to gyubrickers but the full context is that he said that to Ricky's face and Ricky was laughing about it, so gyuvin told him I feel like you think the same about me and Ricky agreed.</p>

      <p>Ricky agrees with everything he says and there was no indication he was laughing idk if the translation came from an audio but how all the translations went Ricky was surprised gyuvin said that to him and said you can't say that to me and when gyuvin asked if he agreed it was more like "yea..... me too.." sorry he was not laughing if the text came from bbl gyuvin wrote it like that himself or acted it outðŸ˜­ and it just sounded like an awk convo

      <p>the fact that ricky's respon to his yaoi act usually only "mm' , "me too", "what" he didnt want to play along with him. but gyubrickers see this as ricky has a same feeling with gyuvin.</p>
