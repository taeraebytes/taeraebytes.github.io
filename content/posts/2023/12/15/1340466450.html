      <p>the way jiwoong fucked up zb1s aaa rookie award speech... im fine with him bringing up his bday but then passing the mic to matthew who was put on the spot üíÄ and let me not talk about how jw tried to end the speech after matthew was done, acting as if hes the leader of the group. you shouldve seen hanbin, hao, gyuvins faces</p>

 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...
