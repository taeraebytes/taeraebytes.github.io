      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>the only thing i hate abt hanbin is his fans which yeah its not his fault but i went from hanbin biased to feeling ehh abt him, i still like him just not as obsessed as before.. and his fans arent even the annoying kind like alot of them have a superiority complex and are downright racist w big followings so it gave me an ick as an asian 🤧 like how ppl hate bts cuz of armys i guess</p>

      <p>No I get you hanbin used to be one of my favs but seeing his fans just be downright nasty and jump gunwook everyday I had to put distance I muted a lot of things related to him so I would have peace on my tl
