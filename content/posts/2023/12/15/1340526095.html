      <p>ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ not you saying boy in luv was good. i dont even wish for my enemy to perform THAT song, and they made taerae rap?? kim taerae? main vocal kim taerae? like i just know that whoever came up with that idea wanted zb1 to get shitted on. jw rap at the beginning was shit too. gyuvin...[sighs] eb is praising him online but i dont see it. zhang hao performed the best (out of bil team), even tho he shouldve been in growl</p>
