      <p>Gen ask what do they mean by wakeone holding hanbin back when he got the most solo job, mcountdown mc job, aaa mc job, even ost. All of them are from CJ&EM too. My bias from other group didn't even get all this in years after debuted while being a popular member from big4 agency

      <p>It's just delusion like they think hanbin would be popular on his own when he needs the group and company just like any other idol

      <p>I feel like most people dont understand that its important to be popular in south korea to get all these job offers. companies dont look at yt views or who sells most albums outside of korea. hanbin has been trending on kforum sites ever since boys planet while he was only a trainee, who are companies gonna cast if not him?</p>

      <p>Well obviously but acting like hanbin is above the company is crazy when he's only popular for a 5th/4th gen male idol
