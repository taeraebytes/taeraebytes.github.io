      <p>the way jiwoong fucked up zb1s aaa rookie award speech... im fine with him bringing up his bday but then passing the mic to matthew who was put on the spot üíÄ and let me not talk about how jw tried to end the speech after matthew was done, acting as if hes the leader of the group. you shouldve seen hanbin, hao, gyuvins faces</p>

      <p>There‚Äôs a clip one of his fansites posted and you can see so clearly than hanbin was getting them to stand in a line and before they had all stood in formation jiwoong did the group greeting and you could see hanbin turn so fast to the micüòÇ I don‚Äôt really care about who does speeches I think they should all be allowed to do a speech but I find the dynamic weird now that they are rushing in to do group greeting when in every single kpop group that has ever existed that‚Äôs always been the leaders role</p>

      <p>I usually don't care either esp since aaa isn't that important but is he ok? Why is he starting the greeting before everyone's ready like ur not the leader for a reason he was rlly off a good one at aaa

      <p>And the fact that before speaking any other member always looks at Hanbin (and Hao surprisingly) to get their ‚Äúok‚Äù even Hanbin sometimes gets the ‚Äúok‚Äù from Hao but no Mister veneers had to show off. And him staring the greeting when not everyone was ready. Allins are mad and they are right to be</p>
