      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more
