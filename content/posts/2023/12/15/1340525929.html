      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>That's what I'm saying like ik rosins and allins hate eo but haobin are the only two I would never drop from the group under any circumstances I have nothing against the rest but the group could've been 5 members bcs the rest are fillers (Hao, Hanbin, Taerae, Ricky, Gunwook-although I would replace Taerae w a taller main vocal)</p>

      <p>when it comes to his own thing yujins a really good dancer Ricky is like an above mediocre singer so I'd say he's a bit more skilled but Ricky draws you in more when he performs so idk it's an preference I probably would pick Ricky since I'm kind of a fan I adore yujin but that's it
