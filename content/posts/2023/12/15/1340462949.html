 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...
