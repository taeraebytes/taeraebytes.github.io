      <p>the way hao akgaes are claiming that hao didnt dance wrong (which he admitted to) and that it was actually the group that got it wrong is so?? like you cannot tell me that 7 other guys got the choreo wrong and only hao nailed it ðŸ˜‚. they probably changed the beat to dance on, so hao could shout "whats up aaa" and then get into the dance but his akgaes act like eb send him hate on bbl (only his fans are subscribed to it lets be fr) for him not following the dance which is just not the truth ðŸ’€, the worst part is that brainless so called "ot9 zeroses" are liking and retweeting that tweet with the thought of "nothing is wrong with it" ...i really have to start blocking people</p>

      <p>I doubt all 8 members just happened to be off but in sync with each other maybe because the tempo of the song was different they started this move on a different count? I'm not sure it's really not that big a deal to me it's possible he was getting jumped on bubble because he does have antis subscribed tho which is an entirely diff issue
