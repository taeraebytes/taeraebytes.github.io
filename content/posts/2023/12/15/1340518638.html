      <p>Sorry I have to defend my gay brothers Haobin don't bait remotely as much as Gyuvin come on, the only crazy thing they say were on fansigns and even then there weren't that much mostly daily anecdotes, when haobin are together they mostly interact normally (they were baiting during bp but it was for survival!!)</p>

      <p>ok i think their only real “bait” moment was during the 2 survivor announcement 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/zhanghaou/status/1637476290713518081"></a>
</blockquote>

other than that, yeah some interactions like the tietie moment were a little played up for camera, but that’s just what they had to do for screentime and they still could be fully viewed as friends just goofing around</p>
