    "question": "she’s like the difinition of an idol, not the most talented vocally or at dancing, but gorgeous, sweet, super hardworking and always professional, i feel bad for her bc she spent her entire life from the age of 13(and even younger than that as a trainee) in this industry which couldn’t have been good for her, i wish for her to kinda retire from idol life at like 25 and live her best life with all the money she’s made",
    "reply": "I hope so too she's been in this so young and there's so much pressure for her to be perfect and she pretty much already is I hope she has the best future possible I think she's happy being an idol rn but in the future if she wants to retire I'm there"
