      <p>i find it so funny how everyone is so convinced that haobin are real when they follow the same formula as every other kpop group and they swear it’s different w them but that’s what literally every kpop stan says. like without fail every group has that one pairing composed of the 2 most popular members and zb1 is not the exception</p>

      <p>Them being both queer changes a lot of things to be fair, I don't think Hao is Hanbin's type however they're queer platonic imo like haojui</p>

      <p>Hanbin chose hao as his visual pick during BP tho? (This is before 1st episode and it’s to determine k and g group centers); it was by 4 stars trainees + votes</p>

      <p>I do think hanbin likes hao the most out of everyone however it can be harder to tell who he’s close too because he’s friendly with everyone and you wouldn’t be able to tell unless you really analysed him, whereas hao is abit more of an open book like it’s pretty easy for us to see he doesn’t fw  jiwoong</p>
