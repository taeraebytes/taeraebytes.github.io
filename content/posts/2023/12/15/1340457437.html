      <p>i feel like he knows exactly who his audience is (girls who thirst for him and want to be topped by him), thats why hes always so weird with the members and is mentioning them on his bbl for no reason ðŸ˜‚

he spends SO MUCH time with his members, isnt he a great hyung? /s</p>

      <p>i think they meant that the fangirls can self insert themselves as members in their minds so heâ€™s just using everyone around him to create this moments and honestly makes sence ðŸ˜­ except for yujin ofc, it more of like â€œlook how great of a dad i am â€œ, but i do find it kinda disgusting how he recently started doing that thing with gyuvin where he pretends heâ€™s going to kiss him in photos, heâ€™s barely a legal adult wtf ðŸ˜­
