      <p>Ningning Giselle Ricky equal??? I think yes ningning is on the weaker side for support but she definitely gets more than Giselle and idk if Ricky is close to the level yet so wouldn't he be under Giselle? But then again idk how much she gets

      <p>Ningning and Ricky are similar in the sense that they both get massively hyped on social media and go viral regularly but does it translate to actual support? At least Ningning has a huge fanbase in China who buys albums and does support projects whereas Ricky hasn't really reached that level yet.</p>

      <p>Well duh riyangis just have this delusion in their heads of his fame the original op tho I think was just comparing how nings popularity operates in aespa and it's similar to Ricky's in zb1s

      <p>everyone exaggerate their fame, for example aespa fans think that Karina bar being big = aespa being super big in China when not even blackpink who is crazy big over there is THAT popular.</p>
