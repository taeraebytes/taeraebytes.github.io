      <p>aaa was visa and passport issues that were inevitable he couldn't renew his passport in time and went back to China now to ensure it wouldn't be an issue again in the future sad but what can u do
fansign was hao literally not allowed to speak and write in his native langue and the other fansign where he has to sign hundreds of albums while he was quarantining(?)
