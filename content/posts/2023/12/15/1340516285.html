      <p>the way jiwoong fucked up zb1s aaa rookie award speech... im fine with him bringing up his bday but then passing the mic to matthew who was put on the spot üíÄ and let me not talk about how jw tried to end the speech after matthew was done, acting as if hes the leader of the group. you shouldve seen hanbin, hao, gyuvins faces</p>

 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...

      <p>jw was counting down but then realized hes not the leader and mentioned hanbin, then hanbin shouted zeroose and the others said mahal kita, and then after they were done talking did the greeting. im really happy that jiwoong didnt become the leader of the group cause wtf was that whole fiasco üòÇ</p>

      <p>I mean beside hanbin, other members listen to hao the most especially yuehuaz if we want to compare with jiwoong, just because he's the oldest doesn't mean he fits leader role
