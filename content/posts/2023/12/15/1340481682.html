      <p>haobin are probably in a situationship or something, i used to think that it was bait but lately that changed idk you don't go and bring your friend to a dinner with your mother and grandma who visited you all the way from china and it's only going to be in korea for like 3 days, specially when other members weren't there. they are kinda sus but you need to pay attention to certain moments bc others are just pure fanservice</p>

      <p>They're definitely close yaoi or not I can see them hao wanting to introduce his mom or grandma I just dont think they'd date like their fans think they do it would mess things up and it would mess with their relationship without invasive people are they do fanservice a lot but that aside it's not like they're strangers so yea that's my piece I don't think situationship either maybe in the beginning when they just met but them dating wouldn't bring them anything good
