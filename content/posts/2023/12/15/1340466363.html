      <p>Ricky popularity is mostly with non-fans and Tiktok fans in the 10's. He's popular but theres no reason to search him but at the bginning of Boys Planet everyone was discussing Jiwoongs kiss scenes and Bl's. Jiwoong is more likely to have a stable fanbase even as ZB1 ends more than ricky imo</p>

      <p>jiwoong has a much smaller fanbase I'd say they're more dedicated but I don't think jiwoongs is more stable he didnt receive an in ear till recently he barely gets fan gifts like Ricky is definitely for the non fans but he's younger and trendier plus his fans are seriously batshit crazy

      <p>Ningning Giselle Ricky equal??? I think yes ningning is on the weaker side for support but she definitely gets more than Giselle and idk if Ricky is close to the level yet so wouldn't he be under Giselle? But then again idk how much she gets

      <p>Ningning and Ricky are similar in the sense that they both get massively hyped on social media and go viral regularly but does it translate to actual support? At least Ningning has a huge fanbase in China who buys albums and does support projects whereas Ricky hasn't really reached that level yet.</p>
