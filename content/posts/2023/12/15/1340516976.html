 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...

      <p>i have a suspicion hao doesn‚Äôt fuck with jiwoong at all abd it‚Äôs kinda mutual,  hao just either looks so done with him most of the time or ignores him and even in their jeju episode of jw‚Äôs show their interactions felt very forced üò≠</p>

      <p>The jeju episode was odd and they're kind of weird with each other they play up to the cameras but they're so standoffish most of the time and that whole episode was just Chinese tourism anyways

      <p>That one video where Jiwoong says hao talks too much Hao was fr mad üò≠y would you say that about someone you're not close with especially since Hao was just jokingly flirting omg he did something similar in Jeju and I could tell Hao was pissed</p>

      <p>Jiwoong really does talk too much and says things he shouldn't üò≠ like he reminds me of a senile elderly man that says crazy shit
