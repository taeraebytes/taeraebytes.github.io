      <p>Sorry I have to defend my gay brothers Haobin don't bait remotely as much as Gyuvin come on, the only crazy thing they say were on fansigns and even then there weren't that much mostly daily anecdotes, when haobin are together they mostly interact normally (they were baiting during bp but it was for survival!!)</p>

      <p>ok i think their only real “bait” moment was during the 2 survivor announcement 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/zhanghaou/status/1637476290713518081"></a>
</blockquote>

other than that, yeah some interactions like the tietie moment were a little played up for camera, but that’s just what they had to do for screentime and they still could be fully viewed as friends just goofing around</p>

      <p>Thank you Ollie (what do we think about Hanbin dedication to learning Chinese and him buying a book during bp just so he could communicate with hao in his mother tongue?); btw he is level 2 now i bet he ain’t that good in Japanese (a language he should promote in 💀)</p>

      <p>Not the same anon but the Japanese Chinese  thing isn’t as comparable. If he’s been learning Chinese since bp it means he’s had 5 extra months of learning that language not to mention he lives with 2 natives meaning he probably has more chances to practice and pick it up in real time. As someone who’s first language is Japanese I was quite impressed with how much his Japanese has improved on the short space between Kcon Japan and mama so I think he’s quite good at language learning in general ( plus he did say sometimes about having a really good memory)</p>
