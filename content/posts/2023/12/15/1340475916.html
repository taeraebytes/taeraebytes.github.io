      <p>i find it so funny how everyone is so convinced that haobin are real when they follow the same formula as every other kpop group and they swear it’s different w them but that’s what literally every kpop stan says. like without fail every group has that one pairing composed of the 2 most popular members and zb1 is not the exception</p>

      <p>Them being both queer changes a lot of things to be fair, I don't think Hao is Hanbin's type however they're queer platonic imo like haojui</p>

      <p>Hanbin chose hao as his visual pick during BP tho? (This is before 1st episode and it’s to determine k and g group centers); it was by 4 stars trainees + votes</p>

      <p>matthew being chosen as g-group visual is still the biggest mystery of bp to me, esp since even his friend didn’t vote for him 😭 he’s not ugly but g-group was just stacked with pretty people</p>
