      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything ðŸ˜Œ

      <p>i think riynagis should have a right to complain considering ricky is undeniably the member who gets the least. not even the least, he doesn't even get bare minimum</p>

      <p>I do too but it can get annoying sometimes the whole cant wait for the group to disband bit is old cherish this while u can cuz I don't think Ricky's gonna redebut. And not to be that person but this treatment is only for this era and as someone who went thru the hell of in bloom with zero promo injury wasted opportunity for my bias it's not as dire as people make it Ricky just got the short end of the stick this time but I digress

      <p>As someone who idolize another mistreat idol from other survival group, i feel dejavu about ricky. the mistreatment wont stop at next promo, it will continue till disband. and i really want the group disband asap coz when they disband the opportunities he got are really really more than when he is with the group. his company purposely
dismissed the offering, and it's exact the same with ricky.</p>

      <p>Hmmm I guess I'd say it's too early to tell because he was treated differently in in bloom but if that's what u think

      <p>The only downside as a fellow Ricky stan is we need to understand yuehua arenâ€™t going to treat him any better, like they have had so many talented / popular and ex produce group idols and they have always let them flop due to bad management. Plus yh didnâ€™t gaf about Ricky till he made the lineup but even now they donâ€™t do shit to promote him on sites like Weibo but do it for the others</p>

      <p>Right that's what I don't understand they wanna speed up zb1 disbandment for probablt even worse treatment yuehua has truly tanked and killed all their groups momentum's hell I rmbr when people were excited for tempests debut but look at them now yea. Ricky was never promoted by the company during bp that's why not a lot of ppl knew him
