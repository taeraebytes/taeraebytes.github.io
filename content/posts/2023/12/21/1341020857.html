      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything ðŸ˜Œ

      <p>i think riynagis should have a right to complain considering ricky is undeniably the member who gets the least. not even the least, he doesn't even get bare minimum</p>

      <p>I do too but it can get annoying sometimes the whole cant wait for the group to disband bit is old cherish this while u can cuz I don't think Ricky's gonna redebut. And not to be that person but this treatment is only for this era and as someone who went thru the hell of in bloom with zero promo injury wasted opportunity for my bias it's not as dire as people make it Ricky just got the short end of the stick this time but I digress

      <p>As someone who idolize another mistreat idol from other survival group, i feel dejavu about ricky. the mistreatment wont stop at next promo, it will continue till disband. and i really want the group disband asap coz when they disband the opportunities he got are really really more than when he is with the group. his company purposely
dismissed the offering, and it's exact the same with ricky.</p>

      <p>Hmmm I guess I'd say it's too early to tell because he was treated differently in in bloom but if that's what u think

      <p>The only downside as a fellow Ricky stan is we need to understand yuehua arenâ€™t going to treat him any better, like they have had so many talented / popular and ex produce group idols and they have always let them flop due to bad management. Plus yh didnâ€™t gaf about Ricky till he made the lineup but even now they donâ€™t do shit to promote him on sites like Weibo but do it for the others</p>

      <p>Right that's what I don't understand they wanna speed up zb1 disbandment for probablt even worse treatment yuehua has truly tanked and killed all their groups momentum's hell I rmbr when people were excited for tempests debut but look at them now yea. Ricky was never promoted by the company during bp that's why not a lot of ppl knew him

      <p>Actually people gotta accept that all the members are going back to nugudom after zb1 d word. Hybe ainâ€™t taking any of them. They are not some charity company and they have plenty of trainees (+ trainee A literally); maybe some company like Cube will take 1/2 trainees? And are they even able to buy their contracts? If Hao is smart he will follow Du-hua and promote in China; but thatâ€™s it. Yujin has a chance in a mid size company too but def not a b4 (not JYP cause he ainâ€™t a vocalist, not hype, no yg ðŸ’€ and SM debut a bg every 10 years); maybe some company like cube/starship/143? The most realistic is redebuting will all the Yuehuaz but they are gonna be mismanaged so bad and yh is obviously gonna promote hao in china wayyyy more than group activities (this is if hao stays in Yuehua)</p>

      <p>hybe dropped trainee a they lowkey all dispersed but I don't think any of these big companies will take them it depends on their market value near the middle of their career and if the members are solid on their own which no one's gonna b really so yea they're not gonna be popular like that but we'll see

      <p>hybe has a million subsidiaries, its highly likely that one of them could buy a contract, and sm is debuting a new gg in 2024 so they're probably going to debut a new bg in 2026/2027. but the only members i see being bought out are yujin and hanbin. hanbin alone is the biggest 5th gen idol in korea rn and if he continues to get major gigs his domestic popularity will probably increase. yujin is 2nd most popular in sk, has already started attending solo schedules and fashion events, and also he'll be only 18 when zb1 disbands so hes still young enough to have another full career. sm called yujin twice  before he signed with yuehua, so if they have plans for a bg in late 2026, it would be smart to sign him because he already has a fanbase and it would bring more attention to the new group and he most definitely would switch to sm. even if a big company doesnt sign them, those 2 are the only ones who will probably stay relevant in sk

i dont have high hopes for the rest of the members. taerae will probably switch to being a ballad singer, the other yuehuas would probably redebut tgt but i think ricky would leave and just be an influencer and gyuvin would try to enter the acting industry bc redebuting under yuehua is career suicide. jiwoong is enlisting and then disappear same w matthew i dont think he will have a shot at redebuting. and gunwook will redebut but probably flop.</p>

      <p>hanbins gonna be considered old and he wants to be an actor so it's really only yujin who has the best shot rest of maknae line hmmmmm depends on how popular they get and everyone else is lowkey on their own
