      <p>jaw shaving has to be one of the worst plastic surgeries ever. i mean they all are because the whole is to make a client return and pay more and more for maintenance but like once you get a jaw shave it's over. it causes very extreme skin sagging on the jaw when the aging process starts and that shit can't be saved by anything other than face lift that will push your hairline further back and lasts only 10 years so you will have to get it over and over again. plastic surgery industry is such a scam</p>

      <p>I don't know if you know 2ne1 but Park Bom's jaw shave is the most dramatic I've seen. I don't know much about them but heard of her on queendom and when I looked at her days with 2ne1 she was so different, different as in pretty. Her jaw looks non existent now compared to then it's crazy. She has a really pretty unique voice tho</p>
