      <p>Gunwook is definitely going to be an idol again 2/3 of jelpiz left I don't see why he'd stay and the company is just so terrible i wish him the best I hope his future is good to him. it rlly all depends on how popular he gets while in zb1 and his popularity is growing fast but we'll see

      <p>this is where your bias gets to your head cuz there's no way gunwook is gonna be successful after zb1. even in zb1 he's a flop</p>

      <p>I said it depends on his fame in zb1...? But even then if debuts in a shit lineup he's done like I'm being realistic w everybody puhlease and his popularity never staggered how would he be a flop if he placed 5th generally he's popular intl and he's ok in korea

      <p>He’s gonna be in a group like cravity? Now is the zb1 fame gonna follow him? We gotta see if the token stans are gonna drop him. Seeing how popular x1/wanna one members are flopping now…. I think the only one to keep the zb1 fame will be haobin and maybe Matthew. Peole don’t Stan ricky for his talent (sad) and top 5-9 don’t even make 1/10 of zb1 fame.</p>

      <p>Idk what group he's gonna be but it rlly could be a cravity 2.0 they had x1 members and popular trainees and debuted almost immediately after disbandment but still flopped mega its just the bg climate but I don't see haobin or Matthew being idols again this is it for most of them I said yujin has the brightest future tho
