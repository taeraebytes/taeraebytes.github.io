 now that i think about it if the person the bnd bodyguard shoved was a sasaeng fansite i wouldn't care. I heard most sasaengs don't even like the idols they stan and constantly talk shit about them. It's more of an obsession thing than love for an idol even tho it may have started that way but then obsession sets in to the point of no return</p>

      <p>these two things are unrelated and this is just a dumb take you don't know if that girl was a sasaeng or not neither did the bodyguard these men are just misogynistic and took the opportunity to use his strength on some girl this is a very sad and scary case but those two things have nothing to rlly do with each other
