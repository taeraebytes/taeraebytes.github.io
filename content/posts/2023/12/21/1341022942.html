    "question": "I think is he branches into acting while in the group and he’s good at it his future is set, I can still see him being an idol I mean he will only be 24 at disbandment so while on the older side definitely not the oldest a big company has debuted. Plus it like for all the members it Will depend on popularity at the end of the contract, if he’s still one of the most popular even a big company might decide it’s worth debuting him in a new group for debut hype. Also ( this isn’t me saying he will go to sm) but clearly some companies are ok with all adult groups because riize debuted with no minors",
