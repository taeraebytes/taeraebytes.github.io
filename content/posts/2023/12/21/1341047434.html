    "question": "which begs the question for me about what the point of making these groups temporary even is... like if none of the produce members except iz*one were super successful after disbandment, why continue to make them temporary when they could reach much bigger heights (and make much more money for the companies) together? Like a lot of the reason people don't want to get into zb1 or any other produce groups is because they are temporary so if they had longer contracts, more people would probably be willing to get into them and also they wouldn't be having to put out content at breakneck speeds which would allow them to have more natural growth rather than just peaking at debut like most produce groups. And the fandom would be so much less hostile too because everyone wouldn't be in competition to make their faves the most popular so that when the group disbands they'll have the best career. Which would also make more people want to get into them because the toxic ass fandom is what turns a lot of people off. I'm just thinking that if the point of having these temporary groups is so that they'll gain popularity and translate into popular groups based off of the members but 9/10 times the members flop after disbandment or even if they don't flop they'll never reach the height of their produce career then why keep this model? It's not like it's not possible for the contracts to be longer anyways, X1 was supposed to have a 7 year contract right?",

I'm sure the original idea was that they wanted to have their idols back and famous in their own companies which I guess you could say is still true all the groups post produce idols debut in wouldnt have been nearly as popular without the produce idols. The companies that use produce shows are notorious for being bad and they're just using the shows as an easy way out. X1 was supposed to be 5 years which is long for produce standards"
