      <p>I mean they might be taking concept pics, I remember in the melting point concept pic behind they mentioned it was 1 day or a couple days after hanbin’s first day at m countdown and that was early September and the cb was nov 6. Considering they probably won’t be able to do much for the rest of the year because of all the shows they might just be trying to get pics in now ? Although I will say it’s till quite early so it could be for something completely different.</p>
