      <p>Gunwook is definitely going to be an idol again 2/3 of jelpiz left I don't see why he'd stay and the company is just so terrible i wish him the best I hope his future is good to him. it rlly all depends on how popular he gets while in zb1 and his popularity is growing fast but we'll see

      <p>this is where your bias gets to your head cuz there's no way gunwook is gonna be successful after zb1. even in zb1 he's a flop</p>

      <p>I said it depends on his fame in zb1...? But even then if debuts in a shit lineup he's done like I'm being realistic w everybody puhlease and his popularity never staggered how would he be a flop if he placed 5th generally he's popular intl and he's ok in korea
