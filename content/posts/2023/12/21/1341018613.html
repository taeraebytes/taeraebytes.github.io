      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything ðŸ˜Œ

      <p>i think riynagis should have a right to complain considering ricky is undeniably the member who gets the least. not even the least, he doesn't even get bare minimum</p>

      <p>I do too but it can get annoying sometimes the whole cant wait for the group to disband bit is old cherish this while u can cuz I don't think Ricky's gonna redebut. And not to be that person but this treatment is only for this era and as someone who went thru the hell of in bloom with zero promo injury wasted opportunity for my bias it's not as dire as people make it Ricky just got the short end of the stick this time but I digress

      <p>As someone who idolize another mistreat idol from other survival group, i feel dejavu about ricky. the mistreatment wont stop at next promo, it will continue till disband. and i really want the group disband asap coz when they disband the opportunities he got are really really more than when he is with the group. his company purposely
dismissed the offering, and it's exact the same with ricky.</p>
