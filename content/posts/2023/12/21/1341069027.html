      <p>because they will have another group from new survival show. it happened with wanna one before, with their last comeback. they barely promoted well, coz CJ already milking them enough. especially zb1 has more akgae and solo stan, the group wont growth because new fans wont fell comfortable to stay with the fandom.</p>

      <p>I mean solos and akgaes are to be expected from a survival show fandom and it's a more normal thing for domestic fans anyways it's not the fandom climate it's just how they're being promoted which is ass
