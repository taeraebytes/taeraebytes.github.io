    "question": "Sorry to have a zerose superiority complex but zb1 are really just naturally funny compared to a lot of these new groups.. riize are introverted which is like fair enough but its different watching content solely following a script and inside jokes. zb1 have more explosive personalities which is more fun for a non-fan to watch . I mean if you know anything about the variety icons of 2nd gen or even the crack videos on youtube of 3rd gen, you need weird characters who will say and do random shit. i will give it to riize (or sm?) that they can gain clout off their genz style variety like tiktoks and tiktok comments, which is less about being funny but more being relatable. Also random thought but they should push Matthew into variety, he will fit well as the Jackson character who struggles in Korean and makes everyone laugh, he's humble but confident enough to make jokes . Hes also very lovable i can see the GP liking him.",
