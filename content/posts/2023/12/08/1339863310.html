      <p>im suprised hanbin hasnt made any idol friends (that we know of) despite being an MC. Like hao has already become close friends with Chenle, Jun and prob other c-line idols. And matthew has Canada line</p>

      <p>Do you think hao genuinely means the friendship he has been trying to form with these idols or just want to leech of them. I mean we know how introvert he is yet out of everyone in the group it’s him who’s trying to initiate these friendships makes me think he has some ulterior motives idk</p>

      <p>he has said he was an exrtovert person in China and loved outings he prolly just turned introvert when he came korea, new environment new people + covid was around
I don't think he's leeching of based on how the other c idols have talked abt him (winwin kun renjun jun..) and he seems genuinely close to chenle</p>

      <p>He initiates the friendships so he defnitely is trying to make connections which is good. He is extremely smart. Even with hanbin, he initiated and it worked. He doesn't trend on instiz unless its with the ship. But he does not post with hanbin on chinese platforms, does he. Hanbin is always willing to give him(and any of his members tbh) a shoutout but hao does not talk about him on his bubble or c platforms except for that paris live which was most likely w1's push.</p>
