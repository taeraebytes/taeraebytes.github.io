      <p>anyone that was a fan of him knows how frustrating it was..... imagine ur tall handsome good at singing a decent dancer yes he was getting completely cut out from editing from having no company and no favoring but he also made every wrong choice. it was so infuriating watching him befriend daeul.. jianyu... jongwoo.... WHAT ARE YOU DOING GO TO TALK TO P01 RIGHT NOW and then giving others main vocal over himself like ur not being humble ur being dumb and then basically fucking on woonggi near the end like ur not serious rn.. yea he was fucking up constantly i had to drop him mid show he was embarrassing me
