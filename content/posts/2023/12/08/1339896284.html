      <p>To think this could've been Hao too if he didn't end up P01 and the center and didn't have a solid fanbase omfg... Not like what he gets is half what he actually deserves but wow wakeone needs to go to hell for how they treat the foreigners</p>

      <p>Yes it's scary how if he wasn't center and didn't have a strong fandom things would b a lot worse for him

      <p>Not really? Look at xiaoting. She is treated like the centre. Hao is treated very much like the centre. Variety show intros, screentime,tiktoks,lines, standing in the middle. What more is needed? Even wony wasnt trated like that.</p>
