      <p>it's bcs tmh is too fast and too high to be sung by one person..but yeh he shouldve chosen songs that suit his tone or at least they shouldve rearranged the song idk</p>

      <p>his tone doesn't match the song and he has a limited range as a singer but I think he had to choose a song from the mini or smth

      <p>I don't even think it's his tone, he just sounds strained no matter what song he signs no hate just something I noticed and don't like about his singing.</p>

      <p>Is it true survival group never have a vocal leason like it's already 2nd comeback but i don't see the improve with some members like yujin gyuvin jiwoong and matthew, even hanbin is still mediocre, ngl i think they will give hanbin some leasons since he got highnotes the most since he's not hao and taerae level</p>

      <p>I know this cc is full of gunwook fans but it is so funny to me y'all criticize every members except gunwook.. 

anyway I doubt wakeone gonna provide them vocal lessons. gyuvin and yujin said they always find taerae for the vocal lessons..also wakeone already got criticized by kfans for not hiring dance teachers during in bloom era ig they dont care about the members skills</p>

      <p>he gets criticized by folks in here I respond to things that aren't as irksome but what's there to criticize he's the most well rounded talented member soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
yujin has improved so he's probably doing a bunch of self learning if he's not provided nun 
and they don't wakeone cares ab maximum profit

      <p>gunwooks only flaw (to korean/chinese people) is his face, even tho i dont know how they can find him ugly? like hes not ugly. wakeone has to start styling his hair better, blame wakeone for everything that goes wrong ‚úäüèª</p>

      <p>why would u lead with that üò≠üò≠ he's handsome but he doesn't fit the current beauty standard in korea obviously but it's fine it's not like ur ugly if u don't fit it in that's what an unconventional beauty is he's been gaining fans steadily from debut so he's charming pplüòå and I don't think wakeone gives him the bad end of the styling stick in fact he gets luckier than most members he always looks cute and he has good proportions so no problems with clothing
