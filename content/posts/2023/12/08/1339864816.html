      <p>real question for those who follow üçö are they fun as a group? I have seen some videos and they seem so boring and awkward :O I don't see the appeal in them plus they're also not as good looking as xo</p>

      <p>Sorry to have a zerose superiority complex but zb1 are really just naturally funny compared to a lot of these new groups.. riize are introverted which is like fair enough but its different watching content solely following a script and inside jokes. zb1 have more explosive personalities which is more fun for a non-fan to watch . I mean if you know anything about the variety icons of 2nd gen or even the crack videos on youtube of 3rd gen, you need weird characters who will say and do random shit. i will give it to riize (or sm?) that they can gain clout off their genz style variety like tiktoks and tiktok comments, which is less about being funny but more being relatable. Also random thought but they should push Matthew into variety, he will fit well as the Jackson character who struggles in Korean and makes everyone laugh, he's humble but confident enough to make jokes . Hes also very lovable i can see the GP liking him.</p>

      <p>yes i think theyre funny even with the scripts they loosely follow them anyways they all have that teenage boy energy (as a group) zb1s tiktoks are so so so sooooo abominable im sorry i think they saw how riize were like captioning their tiktoks and tried to follow suit... its not working anton is rlly ur average chronically online teenage boy plus their better marketing team that wakeone cant ever dream of having

i feel like matthew and jackson are diff i can see what u mean but i just cant see him carrying that out cuz hes not as loud and jacksons very quick on his feet but he could have smth unique to him

      <p>dont hate me because i love our matchew but he's not THAT funny, the only times I've seen him make ppl laugh on variety shows is when he swears. It's cute at first but he swears every damn show and it's not funny or edgy anymore. I'm too young to know about got7 but I know who jackson is because even though they're an older group his name left an impact in the kpop industry for being naturally funny, making jokes/ outburst while not crossing the line. It may be be because matthew is still a rookie but the jokes he made already got him in so much trouble on the kside, one example is the one where he was arm wrestling that one pro athlete and being edgy by saying 'are u really an athlete' or something. Hanbin literally has anxiety every time he opens his mouth because multiple times he got shit on from knets for crossing the line.

Also I don't think "character who struggles in Korean and makes everyone laugh' is a good thing... I mean coming from a country known to mock and look down on foreigners and openly say racist shit... yikes. Hope anon knows in most cases when they're "laughing" they're not laughing at their bad korean but laughing AT them. It's like laughing at a Indian transfer student trying to speak english with an indian accent... not a good thing.</p>

      <p>I'm a seokryu and I do agree that matt should stop with cursing BUT u know what he cursed not as much as y'all think like most of the time he mispronounced the koreans words or there's another context..but zeroses posted that things without any context. 

also he really didn't know that guy was ufc fighter üò≠ he doesn't even know some of famous idols do y'all think he recognizes that ufc fighter?? but yes I hope he stop cursing  on shows "intentionally".</p>
