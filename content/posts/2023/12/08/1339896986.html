      <p>To think this could've been Hao too if he didn't end up P01 and the center and didn't have a solid fanbase omfg... Not like what he gets is half what he actually deserves but wow wakeone needs to go to hell for how they treat the foreigners</p>

      <p>Not really? Look at xiaoting. She is treated like the centre. Hao is treated very much like the centre. Variety show intros, screentime,tiktoks,lines, standing in the middle. What more is needed? Even wony wasnt trated like that.</p>

      <p>tbh i agree when rosins complained about mistreatment its only valid when its abt less solo jobs but not about center treatment in group songs, mvs, screentimes & thumbnails bc he's treated WELL as a center. like most zb1 youtube thumbnail always only making his face bigger than the rest etc like thats a center treatment and i dont think rosin should complain abt that</p>
