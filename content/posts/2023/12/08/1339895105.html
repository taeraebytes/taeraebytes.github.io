      <p>"even taerae" the taerae in question debuted because his performance went viral among non fans and they all voted for him lol if wakeone gave one fuck about promoting him he'd have clout but they don't</p>

      <p>taerae is literally my bias but you got to admit that most of his clout has unfortunately gone away by now maybe it would be different if wakeone promoted him differently but we're talking about reality rn not some alternate universe</p>
