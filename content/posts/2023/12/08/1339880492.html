      <p>damn apparently jiwoong's birthday is next week and now i'm remembering the early zb1 days where if someone's birthday was soon you WOULD know b/c half the tl would be guessing and even arguing about who'd show up. and you would see every single tiktok that was posted on your tl too. lowkey i miss those days maybe i'm crazy but there's too much content now like let's slow down a bit...</p>

      <p>rickys bday live was so lit i rlly woke up at 5 am was so lit off that being an early fun was so fun like i rmbr waiting two hours for their first airport schedule but idk if u rmbr after the 1-2 weeks of promotions for in bloom is radio silent for over a month which not only was a blow to their fandom it was just a terrible time ugh i dont wanna go back to that. but i do feel like if they created more hype around their lives and content it could be similar to that early rush but they barely have a team holding this group together.
