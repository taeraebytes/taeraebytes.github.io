      <p>im suprised hanbin hasnt made any idol friends (that we know of) despite being an MC. Like hao has already become close friends with Chenle, Jun and prob other c-line idols. And matthew has Canada line</p>

      <p>Do you think hao genuinely means the friendship he has been trying to form with these idols or just want to leech of them. I mean we know how introvert he is yet out of everyone in the group itâ€™s him whoâ€™s trying to initiate these friendships makes me think he has some ulterior motives idk</p>

      <p>he has said he was an exrtovert person in China and loved outings he prolly just turned introvert when he came korea, new environment new people + covid was around
I don't think he's leeching of based on how the other c idols have talked abt him (winwin kun renjun jun..) and he seems genuinely close to chenle</p>

      <p>He initiates the friendships so he defnitely is trying to make connections which is good. He is extremely smart. Even with hanbin, he initiated and it worked. He doesn't trend on instiz unless its with the ship. But he does not post with hanbin on chinese platforms, does he. Hanbin is always willing to give him(and any of his members tbh) a shoutout but hao does not talk about him on his bubble or c platforms except for that paris live which was most likely w1's push.</p>

      <p>didnâ€™t rosins lock haoâ€™s topic on instiz bc his posts were getting stormed with hate every time? like iâ€™m not saying he would be top 10 trending all the time bc it definetely wouldnâ€™t be the case, but i also always found it a little that hb is always top 10 trending when there are a lot of idols who are way more popular in sk? sure maybe hanbin is one the few male 5th gen idols that have at least some sort of recognition by gp, but heâ€™s definitely not one of the most popular idols overall? but idk how instiz work so</p>

      <p>Hmm the only way I can explain this is using someone like kang Daniel ( no Iâ€™m not saying hanbin is kang Daniel) but what I am saying is it may seem weird to us because heâ€™s not the most popular internationally but he is very popular domestically and among the kr gp aswell. Like kd isnâ€™t that popular internationally but heâ€™s always topping br in kr and naver. Tbh I thought his fans were exaggerating his popularity over there but I went over in august for a summer trip and turns out he actually is just that popular there. Also the trending on instiz has nothing to do with locked post because even though his post were locked he still trended at 10 on the day of mama ( day 1)</p>

      <p>Hanbin is most popular domestically and is 2nd most popular intlly unlike daniel who had his popularity based entirely in korea. He's fine for a 5ht gen. Korea is still ruled by 3rd gen. 

Regarding hao, even if posts are locked, they can trend. The one time i saw him trending high with high views was the covid news. He never had any other viral posts. Even neulbin has no virality. Trending is different. Viral is different. Many people posting at the same time causes trends. Group and member posts are usually locked.</p>
