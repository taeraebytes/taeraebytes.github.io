      <p>only current hype hybe group is newjeans. bnd irrelevant, left in the dust. enhyphen still has fans but most knets and fans dropped them cuz of the couple choreo in bite me, members being fatphobic, homophobic and their general off vibes. Idk about seventeen are they part of hybe? hybe be buying all labels so idek anymore.

would love zb1 to do challenges/ collabs with newjeans cause their international hype is insane but i doubt it. It's a shame though since a lot of zb1 members share same age ranges with them and feel like they'd get along but dating scandals are too risky for a rookie group and there's already rumors about gunwookie havign a crush on hanni so... :(</p>
