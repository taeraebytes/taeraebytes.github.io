      <p>talent wise its literally: 

haorae (ties, they dont even have much gap in skills unlike other group with obvious 1 main vocal)
hanbin (wide range, naturally higher voice so high notes is easier for him, best chorus carrier, can harmonize)
gunwook (pretty singing style, can support, but thin voice & straining problem)
 wall
ricky
matthew
jiwoong
yujin
gyuvin</p>

      <p>Gunwook does strain hope he improves since he's had 0 vocal training but when he's in his range he's perfect and can harmonized and his voice isn't thin at all he has a strong voiceðŸ˜­ sorry hanbins is much thinner it's why is hns sound kinda flat hanbins good but I just don't think he's better than gunwook he doesn't strain as much but he can get offkey(?) dk if that's the right word with his live notes
I think with adequate training it'll become more obvious

      <p>thereâ€™s a pretty big wall between haorae and hanbin too tbh. gunwook has a better voice at his peak but heâ€™s kinda inconsistent while hanbin doesnâ€™t have that issue.</p>
