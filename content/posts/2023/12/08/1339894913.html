      <p>they all split into 3 teams of 3
team 1: gunwook, matthew and hanbin
team 2: ricky, taerae and gyuvin
team 3: hao, yujin and jiwoong.

those teams are ZBTV different divisions
gunwooks > Current Affairs and Entertainment Dept., haos > Film and Drama Dept.,
rickys > Style Dept.

i know its a shit concept but listen to this drama, haos team is all over the place. in this episode the teams had to style one of their team members and just in this episode alone jiwoong started 'scolding' yujin to the point hanbin had to kind of step up to stop him from taking it too far, after that hao didnt really go to the back where they had to style their team member (yujin), hao already looked like he wanted to go home and this is like the beginning of the shoot. i dont get how some fans still find it funny when jiwoong talks in a harsh way, because he is the one that finds it funny, yujin is of course gonna smile through the pain.</p>
