      <p>im suprised hanbin hasnt made any idol friends (that we know of) despite being an MC. Like hao has already become close friends with Chenle, Jun and prob other c-line idols. And matthew has Canada line</p>

      <p>Do you think hao genuinely means the friendship he has been trying to form with these idols or just want to leech of them. I mean we know how introvert he is yet out of everyone in the group it’s him who’s trying to initiate these friendships makes me think he has some ulterior motives idk</p>

      <p>he has said he was an exrtovert person in China and loved outings he prolly just turned introvert when he came korea, new environment new people + covid was around
I don't think he's leeching of based on how the other c idols have talked abt him (winwin kun renjun jun..) and he seems genuinely close to chenle</p>

      <p>He initiates the friendships so he defnitely is trying to make connections which is good. He is extremely smart. Even with hanbin, he initiated and it worked. He doesn't trend on instiz unless its with the ship. But he does not post with hanbin on chinese platforms, does he. Hanbin is always willing to give him(and any of his members tbh) a shoutout but hao does not talk about him on his bubble or c platforms except for that paris live which was most likely w1's push.</p>

      <p>didn’t rosins lock hao’s topic on instiz bc his posts were getting stormed with hate every time? like i’m not saying he would be top 10 trending all the time bc it definetely wouldn’t be the case, but i also always found it a little that hb is always top 10 trending when there are a lot of idols who are way more popular in sk? sure maybe hanbin is one the few male 5th gen idols that have at least some sort of recognition by gp, but he’s definitely not one of the most popular idols overall? but idk how instiz work so</p>

      <p>instiz is just full of bp trainees fans. last time I checked 5/6 zb1 members were in the top 10 of instiz private rooms (like pages) and hanbin is first. but zb1 posts rarely trending on other platforms like theqoo.</p>

      <p>I mean you could use the quoo then to determine his domestic popularity because he’s trended there quite a bit and I know that he got his own topic on the quoo before the group even got one. Correct me if I’m wrong but as far as I’m aware it’s much harder to trend on the quoo because you need a registered Korean number ? To sign up</p>

      <p>Different anon but on the contrary his kstats have actually boomed since the end of bp so he’s arguably a lot more popular now</p>

      <p>I feel like it's more fan focused now (like strong fandom) but before like pre finale he's still recognized by the gp but it was just crazier w the rush of trying to get him to debut
