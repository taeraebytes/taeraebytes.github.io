      <p>his tone doesn't match the song and he has a limited range as a singer but I think he had to choose a song from the mini or smth

      <p>I don't even think it's his tone, he just sounds strained no matter what song he signs no hate just something I noticed and don't like about his singing.</p>

      <p>Is it true survival group never have a vocal leason like it's already 2nd comeback but i don't see the improve with some members like yujin gyuvin jiwoong and matthew, even hanbin is still mediocre, ngl i think they will give hanbin some leasons since he got highnotes the most since he's not hao and taerae level</p>

      <p>anon you do know that not everyone in a nine membered boy group has to be a main vocal right ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ like i get not wanting them to be bed but hanbin is not bad for the year hes trained, i feel like hes insecure about his voice</p>

      <p>Yea we just need 4 tbh but it would be nice if everyone else could hold a note just a dream I have... but hanbin isn't bad I feel like he's given too much for where he's at like 3 highnotes already?

      <p>His highnotes in take my hand is bad, even sound bad in studio version like can you imagine how bad is that, his highnote in in bloom is mid but still weak no vibrato at all, wakeone can keep giving him choruses but i hope they can stop with the highnotes</p>

      <p>Wakeone should give him verses tbh. Choruses should be a group chorus. High notes by taerae and hao. Hb's voice is sufficiently decent technique and stable. But wakeone keeps giving those parts to yujin and ricky who are way below technique wise while giving high notes to hanbin.</p>

      <p>okaayyy i feel like the high notes dont even have to be all that high cuz taerae aint hitting all that like those lower strong ones would be better ricky and yujin are just good in their tones but thats rlly it yujin is improving tho

      <p>Hanbin's vocal colour/tone is what koreans like. His tidbits go viral of all the vocal members.  Hao should do the high notes or taerae(taerae has a fuller sound). Yujin is improving but he still isnt as good. Matthew and Ricky sound nasal. Gunwook should get more lines than mattricky.</p>
