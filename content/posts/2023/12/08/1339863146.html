It may be be because matthew is still a rookie but the jokes he made already got him in so much trouble on the kside, one example is the one where he was arm wrestling that one pro athlete and being edgy by saying 'are u really an athlete' or something.

I mean coming from a country known to mock and look down on foreigners and openly say racist shit... yikes.

      <p>real question for those who follow 🍚 are they fun as a group? I have seen some videos and they seem so boring and awkward :O I don't see the appeal in them plus they're also not as good looking as xo</p>

      <p>Sorry to have a zerose superiority complex but zb1 are really just naturally funny compared to a lot of these new groups.. riize are introverted which is like fair enough but its different watching content solely following a script and inside jokes. zb1 have more explosive personalities which is more fun for a non-fan to watch . I mean if you know anything about the variety icons of 2nd gen or even the crack videos on youtube of 3rd gen, you need weird characters who will say and do random shit. i will give it to riize (or sm?) that they can gain clout off their genz style variety like tiktoks and tiktok comments, which is less about being funny but more being relatable. Also random thought but they should push Matthew into variety, he will fit well as the Jackson character who struggles in Korean and makes everyone laugh, he's humble but confident enough to make jokes . Hes also very lovable i can see the GP liking him.</p>

      <p>yes i think theyre funny even with the scripts they loosely follow them anyways they all have that teenage boy energy (as a group) zb1s tiktoks are so so so sooooo abominable im sorry i think they saw how riize were like captioning their tiktoks and tried to follow suit... its not working anton is rlly ur average chronically online teenage boy plus their better marketing team that wakeone cant ever dream of having

i feel like matthew and jackson are diff i can see what u mean but i just cant see him carrying that out cuz hes not as loud and jacksons very quick on his feet but he could have smth unique to him
