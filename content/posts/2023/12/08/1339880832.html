      <p>I think if he was forced into the role he'd be a lot more present than he is now but a good job? Hm I guess we'll never know

      <p>my thing with him is he wasn't the leader in his old group & he has the most experience so I feel like he should step up and take responsibility as the eldest being the leader for ZB1. Think he said something about wanting to experience maknae things or he doesn't want the other members to view him as the eldest but like u weren't the eldest nor the leader in ur old group so?.... dunno how much the leader was decided by wakeone or zb1 members but if hanbin wasnt leader he would be more free and express himself more instead of worrying this and that, which i also feel like is limiting his individual growth. maybe some ppl like the uptightness but yeah...

tho jw would suck ass, i mean he ditches the group to go to his apartment with his gf LMAOO</p>

      <p>i think hanbin was the perfect choice the company probably suggested him or jiwoong and the members rely on him a lot it was obvious it was always gonna be him hes smart imagine leader responsibility being attached to jiwoong he wouldve def got exposed by now
