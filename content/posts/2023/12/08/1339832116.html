      <p>Might be an unpopular opinion but post zb1 I really don’t want gw back in jellyfish and would rather have him redebut with one of the more popular members. If zb1 continues to stay popular and successful I think big companies will try and buy out contracts to create bive or besserafim 2.0. My objective opinion is that hanbin and hao ( should the group stay successful) Will definitely get offers from big companies, also Yujin too. However with Yujin he’s already opened up about being scouted by big companies like am and turning them down for yh so I don’t know if they will reach out again or if he’s just loyal and will stay with yh. Hao is also an anomaly for me because I have no doubt he will get offeres but I think duhua will genuinely offer the world to get him to stay at her company. Hanbin I think will easily go, Ravi has been sentenced with a 2 year probation meaning he will start serving right at the end of zb1 contract so tbh it’s an easy option for him to move and I think big companies will want him as well especially for the domestic popularity. My hope is that Gunwook is offered something with any of them too ( not in yh tho 😭) because jellyfish is truly ass and I can’t have him go to waste in nugudan</p>
