      <p>"even taerae" the taerae in question debuted because his performance went viral among non fans and they all voted for him lol if wakeone gave one fuck about promoting him he'd have clout but they don't</p>

      <p>taerae is literally my bias but you got to admit that most of his clout has unfortunately gone away by now maybe it would be different if wakeone promoted him differently but we're talking about reality rn not some alternate universe</p>

      <p>wasn't it because he had many non fans tuning in for him after his man in love stage went viral? they wanted him to debut but don't care about zb1 now, also no I don't think him being k02 means he was necessarily more popular than the other zb1 members during boys planet he's pretty much the only member along with ricky who wasn't treated like the main character on boys planet since episode 1 and since the kfandom hasn't really grown since boys planet it's clear that compared to the other members he has less fans (bc he never had that big of a core fanbase to begin with, how would he with 0 screentime and barely ever getting to speak on boys planet unlike other members) 

I'd argue the majority of the members had bigger core fanbases than him even during boys planet, but his core fanbase is solid and loving now I think it's big enough and only appears small when you compare it to the other zb1 members</p>
