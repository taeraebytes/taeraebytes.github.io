      <p>Allins were mad and threatened as hell to gunwook since the possibility of him being a mc has higher chance now. Iâ€™m in this gdm with allins including big accounts and they were cursing and fatshaming gunwook. They were also talking to K allins to expose gunwook to pannchoa about him being close to noonas and sasaengs. I think gunwook will be the next one to be expose just like seunghan of riize. Praying for your subfandom sis goodluck on protecting gunwook from other kpop groups and knetz. This might put gunwook on hiatus too.</p>
