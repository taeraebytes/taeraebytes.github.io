      <p>this is kinda crazy, my friend went to mma and said that zb1 was one of the groups that had the loudest cheers not just from zeroses but from ppl who came for other groups and that's quite rare yet the idols reacting were crickets except for youngji, that one girl who gave wonyoung the blanket and like two other ppl. Guess ur not allowed to cheer if ur not from the same company ig which fcking sucks cuz zb1 didnt gaf and cheered no matter boy or girl group.</p>
