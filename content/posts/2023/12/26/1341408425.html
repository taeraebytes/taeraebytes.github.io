And yeah afaik his 1 year contract would have expired in September 2023 because he started in September 2022 so itâ€™s most likely that they have kept him on, if he was leaving the most likely would have said before the shows stopped for award season just like mcountdown did with miyeon.",

      <p>Iâ€™d rather not there ðŸ˜­ they are so nugu, no one big every really goes there and tbh once an idol mcâ€™s for 1 music station you never see them go to another one so Iâ€™d rather none of them be tied to that one</p>
