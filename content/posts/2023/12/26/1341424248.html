      <p>Iâ€™d rather not there ðŸ˜­ they are so nugu, no one big every really goes there and tbh once an idol mcâ€™s for 1 music station you never see them go to another one so Iâ€™d rather none of them be tied to that one</p>

      <p>nah if it's show champion the other companies don't care. they only care if it's a big show like mcountdown, inkigayo, music core and music bank.

doyoung and jaehyun started at show champion and then both of them got picked by inkigayo</p>
