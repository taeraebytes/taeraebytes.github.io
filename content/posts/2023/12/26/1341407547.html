      <p>The shaved brows is really a disservice he has a long and skinny face and it just makes it worse like he needs smth thick on his face for balance they're out to get him cuz it looks like shit

      <p>ngl Ricky looked really different in bp to how he does now for some reason, could that be due to the eyebrows?</p>

      <p>what's funny is today i thought he really looked like his bp self, i think it's the hairstyle they had him in bc it reminded me of the one we'd see him have when his hair was that yellow colour lmao. but yeah he does look different otherwise and i've never been able to pinpoint why, he even looks quite different from the post-finale period to now but that might also be due to the contacts/makeup style (though his face also looked more full before?)</p>

      <p>It's definitely makeup and brows they really can change so much about your face esp eyebrows cuz he had naturally thick and arched brows but now they're like straigjt that make him look evil
