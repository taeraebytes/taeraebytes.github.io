      <p>wonbin is between 175-178 heâ€™s not that much shorter than chanchanz and theyâ€™re both 185-186. he was also in the line w a bunch of idols + matthew and everyone else was roughly the same height while matthew looked significantly shorter. i do think matthew is 170 i doubt heâ€™s any smaller but heâ€™s pretty buff which gives the illusion that heâ€™s shorter than he is</p>

      <p>I've seen both irl and they're proper shorties and just based off of their proportions and looking right at their shoes you can tellðŸ˜­ wonbin was a decent 175 with the insoles alone. everyone is lying ab their height not just them. If a male idol is actually 170 cm why would they tell the truth when they can fudge it by a few centimeters because usually 5'7 male idols get jumped so the same goes for those even shorter they bump it up
