      <p>Ok my prediction; Jiwoong big scandal (probably starts w attitude and his dating gets exposed again after), I can also see Hao say something reckless prob fatphobic only ifans will care, Hanbin is retouching his eyelids and gets into a controversy about him being dishonest with the fans but it won't affect him much, Gyuvin controversy and it sours his mood for a while, Gunwook controversy MAYBE but I'm feeling it for 2025 instead</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ can we move gunwooks to 2026? But I don't think hanbin would like lie ab anything to anyone hed probably just get smth done and get dragged major jiwoong would probably have a huge scandal but it's better than somebody else ig and gyuvin yea probably

      <p>Tbh I donâ€™t think hanbin would get anything done atp, like heâ€™s had alot done already and Iâ€™d say his face right now is described as â€˜classically handsomeâ€™ if heâ€™s smart at least he wonâ€™t touch up anything because imo despite having alot done he doesnâ€™t look botched but that may not be the case if he gets more done. Plus zb1 donâ€™t have any breaks in their schedule I doubt heâ€™d have time to do it and heal with how much their schedule is packed.</p>

      <p>I wanna say he's done too his face hasn't changed for a long while but when you get ps there's maintenance you gotta do and sometimes it can get wonky but for the most part he's not gonna get anything crazy probably filler at most which everyone does
