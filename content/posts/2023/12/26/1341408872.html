      <p>2024 predictions: Gyuvin will be put on hiatus due to controversy. Jiwoong will get caught smoking. Matthew will get injured. Hao will say something reckless and have to apologize for it. Hanbin will get more plastic surgery. Yujin will drop out.</p>

      <p>Ok my prediction; Jiwoong big scandal (probably starts w attitude and his dating gets exposed again after), I can also see Hao say something reckless prob fatphobic only ifans will care, Hanbin is retouching his eyelids and gets into a controversy about him being dishonest with the fans but it won't affect him much, Gyuvin controversy and it sours his mood for a while, Gunwook controversy MAYBE but I'm feeling it for 2025 instead</p>

      <p>ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ can we move gunwooks to 2026? But I don't think hanbin would like lie ab anything to anyone hed probably just get smth done and get dragged major jiwoong would probably have a huge scandal but it's better than somebody else ig and gyuvin yea probably
