      <p>Hao used to say he didn't drink in china because he's a lightweight, I guess the struggle made him start drinking</p>

      <p>ok he only said he drinks before going to bed sometimes because it makes it easier to fall asleep letâ€™s not blow it out of proportion pleaseâ€¦ some people drink like a glass of wine bc it doesnâ€™t make you hangover the next day and it definitely is not the same as being a full blown alcoholic cmon ðŸ˜­ although i wish he would take melatonin or smth instead</p>
