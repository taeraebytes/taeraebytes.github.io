      <p>At least he's more decent than some boyfriends of the other girlies. Although when they started dating I remember seeing a lot of rumors about how lots of male idols were interested on Ryujin and SF9;Byungchan fucking up and publicly following Ryujin hashtag on instagram thinking that the hashtag following was private ðŸ˜­. So in certain way I guess that Haechan lucked out</p>
