      <p>do you think that hanbin-taerae-hao- gunwook and ricky-gyuvin-gunwook-yujin-matthew being on a different floor is also affecting their dynamics?</p>

      <p>i recall a member mentioning they were on different floors in a live or something (i think it was gyuvin) and i've forgotten how, maybe through this gyuvin live too, but it was basically confirmed that hao-gunwook and hanbin-taerae are on the same floor, plus hanbin said at a fansign they're the members he hangs out with most in the dorms. gunwook definitely isn't on the other floor since he rooms with hao lmao but something i've been curious about is the matthew-yujin-jiwoong (?) situation like i assume matthew and yujin room together because all the others have mentioned who they room with but matthew and yujin have never mentioned it themselves so it's like do they have solo rooms? though i don't think they'd be the only members sleeping by themselves bc that's random as hell? and i mention jiwoong bc i know he has an apartment but for promos/comeback period i imagine it's easier for him to stay in the dorm so does he stay in any of the members rooms (like matthew and yujin's bc before that dating rumour i assumed that he dormed with them since, again, the other members had already mentioned their roommates. also funnily enough i'm pretty sure jiwoong was the first one to hint at their dorm arrangement and said they all switched rooms each night so that's ironic - though he was probably referring to when he stayed with them during debut era promos), does he stay with a manager since i assume they have one that lives with them like most rookie groups or what</p>

      <p>in gyuv bbl live the other day when he was sick and didnt attend the fansign u can hear yujin and ricky coming home singing super shy but i didn't hear matt at all or the rest of the members. so for sure gyuv ricky and yujin are in the same apartment/ floor, gyuv and ricky share a room so prob matt and yujin share a room. Gunwook mentioned multiple times he got closer to hao and vice versa because they share the same room and hanbin jiwoong and taerae idk the room sitch but def in the same apartment/ floor as gunwook and hao</p>
