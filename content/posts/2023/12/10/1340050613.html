      <p>Its kinda funny that only Zhanghao got into the gc and not Ricky i thought it was like a solidarity group for c-idols  but it seems more exclusive than i thought , maybe they only let Zh in cause he was pestering. Also its nice that Chenle is close to Zh but i realised Renjun was giving silent treatment when they were interacting , lowkey ningning too but that could just be avoiding ships and stuff. In comparison to Renjun being really friendly with Xiaoting last year award show. Maybe they dont vibe</p>

      <p>i think because ricky has that american identity its a little bit different he spent his formative years in LA and thats where his home is plus hes just a quieter person probably doesnt make friends as easily
