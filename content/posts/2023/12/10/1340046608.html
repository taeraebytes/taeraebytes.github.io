      <p>well not tea but let's stir up the pot...

don't you think that zerocolas and gyubrickers (idk their ship fandom) also act insane on those fancalls bc hao, kinda feeds into it? like if you compare hanbin answers he's not even doing all that, his answers are more normal meanwhile hao it's 2 seconds away from being gyuvin 2.0. for example, people attacked the op that asked the "is there a thing that you feel like you can't do without hanbin?" the question wasn't even bad, and they asked gyuvin the same question previously but the question took a whole new path when hao started talking about how his body is cold while hanbin body is warm and all that... hao please be serious.

meanwhile for gyubrick, yeah gyuvin doing too much but ricky also says insane things too... gyuvin takes the cake but it's not like ricky is innocent either.</p>

      <p>not really, hanbin worst crime was just when he said "hao" when someone asked if he prefers sea or mountain, he calmed himself down after that half of my soul question. lately hao has been the one pushing with those replies, he was the one who said that thing about him and hanbin cuddling bc hanbin body is warm and his was cold, he also replied to that question on where he said that he didn't pick hanbin during the game caterers show question about introducing your sister to one of the members with "i didn't pick hanbin bc he's mine", he also replied to that weird question about hanbin blowing dry his hair too, etc.</p>
