      <p>If I'm being honest he's kinda suss to me. During one of his very first bbl lives he said 'noona you can call me when I'm not live" or something in that context implying he probably talks to them privately. Hope he aint the next Haruto.</p>

      <p>i saw it as a please dont interrupt moment but i can see both its frustrating and sad i dont think he purposely seeks them ou like a haechan sitch probably feels indebted to them and they all a lot older than himðŸ˜¬ he had an extreme hate train so theres alot of insecurity and self doubt that came along with it and probably just wants to appease fans the whole group has a funny relationship with their solo fandoms
