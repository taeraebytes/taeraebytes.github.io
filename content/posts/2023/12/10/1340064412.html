 rosins in the qrts are actually psycho like saying the perf will flop or asking the cbar to not buy albums or asking people to boycott over hao not having a solo big. I’m not one to defend allins like I’ll be the first to drag them but them guessing hanbin in the qrts makes a little sense consort his is a hanbin focused account but the rosins are mad weird because calling it Centre erasure like he didn’t have a whole ass solo at the mama intro on day one and then also have his solo moment on the group’s performance too. Bffr some of the members have had nothing and with the way it seems it’s like they are giving the spotlight to different members each perf which I think it good, they really want this group to be hao and friends. Like damn let the other 4 who have had nothing have their moment at least, just greedy and selfish</p>

      <p>People think that it's hanbin bc spella (his tutting teacher) and one of his dancer friends posted stories at KBS building and those stories had zb1 songs on it. That's why they are being bitchy about it. Anyways, rosins need to be prepared bc those music shows prefer to do dancing stages than singing stages, so the possibility of hanbin getting a lot of stages it's possible. But hopefully MBC includes Hao in the 00 line stage they are probably doing this year.</p>

      <p>Nah it ended up being a group this it’s just the people who leaked it only mentioned that hanbin looked really good and Gunwook tripped on smth. But later that day Ricky mentioned they had a group schedule related to singing and it would come out later</p>

      <p>Yeah I think so, because Ricky mentioned that day they had a singing schedule. I think the spella thing might still be for zb1 but for something completely different because it was from a couple days after the rumor came out
