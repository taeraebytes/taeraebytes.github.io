      <p>same and I really do believe it's because they all have different dance backgrounds and styles so during in bloom era they looked so messy even when they were all doing the same moves. Some would make the move smoothly, some would make the move sharp and hard and some wouldn't even make the move at all lmao. But they really improved during crush era and it seems like their styles are slowly meshing into one the more they're together. Damn #OT9?</p>
