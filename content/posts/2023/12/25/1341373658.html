      <p>I don’t care that he took pics with kids from school because that’s the most normal thing ever but I am wondering if it’s allowed because usually they aren’t allowed to be posted on other peoples socials. ( except for things like their graduations as far as I’ve seen). Because I remember one of Hanbin’s friends posting a vlog at uni post bp but pre debut and he was in a bit of it and in less than a day it got taken down. So I am worried if he’s being forced or coerced into taking pics with loads of random students</p>

      <p>usually idols cant even take pics with fans they meet when theyre out but seeing as no manager was present and ppl probably insisted he took the pics 
hanbins video was taken down cuz he let his image drop right like he was acting diff and im p sure its cuz he was with a bunch of girls

      <p>Hanbin friend also deleted bc they were talking about drinking alcohol and going to bars in the vlog, so it's not as simple as that.</p>

      <p>which is weird in itself. like why would you include going to bars and stuff in your vlog when you know your friend is a trainee participating at a survival show 💀💀 makes no sense, its like they dont know how kpop fans can be</p>

      <p>Jealous friends of his back in la basically cut him off after being a trainee you could say Ricky cut them off first but cmon who doesn't take the chance to brag ab being friends with a televised trainee or an idol you can tell they don't fw him anymore he's wiped from eeeeverything. also the ones that did say smth ab him were kind of weird I never saw myself but I'd see tweets from early bp of ppl being like oh I heard this ab him thru such and such from his friend or apparently the one that draw skz yaoi I wasn't there for that
