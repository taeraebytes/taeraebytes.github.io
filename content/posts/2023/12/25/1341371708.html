      <p>Its kinda funny seeing how Hanbinâ€™s Love me Right fancam was in the top 10 most viewed fancams of the year bc he will never be able to accomplish that again. He had more fans as a bp trainee than he does now as an idol</p>

      <p>nothing is consistent about hb if we go by allindans logic and consider fancam views as a metric of success hao would be miles ahead of him lmfao</p>

      <p>Gunwook deserves so much more but geonppangdans don't have any competitive spirit in their sf, they don't care that much about streaming and engagements, also tell me why you guys aren't more annoying about gunwook being the best rapper out of the male rookies when we could have more brownie points for zb1</p>
