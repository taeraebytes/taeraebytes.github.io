I also think that Ricky, gyuvin, and jiwoong are interchangeable tbh (with taerae obviously being last) they all struggle with different aspects of their technique. Id personally put ricky slightly above the other two cuz he’s shown evidence of good isolations and details but yeah. tbh it’s better to rank them in tiers since they’re interchangeable at times:\n\nTier 1: Hanbin\nTier 2: Gunwook\nTier 3: Matthew, Yujin\nTier 4: Hao\nTier 5: Ricky, Gyuvin, Jiwoong \nTier 6: Taerae",

5)Gyuvin
6)Ricky

      <p>how do I say this without being unbiased gunwook is definitely a better dancer than matthew and more skilled than yujin I've watched a bunch of commentary's from professionals and this is usually the consensus yujin has a contemporary style which I think is interesting since he's never had any type of training but in general when it comes to technique he still lacks and taerae is easily the worst dancer actually wait this list is a little whack the weakest are 7)Ricky 8) gyuvin 9) taerae jiwoongs stiff but he's easily better than those 3
