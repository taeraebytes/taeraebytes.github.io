      <p>how do I say this without being unbiased gunwook is definitely a better dancer than matthew and more skilled than yujin I've watched a bunch of commentary's from professionals and this is usually the consensus yujin has a contemporary style which I think is interesting since he's never had any type of training but in general when it comes to technique he still lacks and taerae is easily the worst dancer actually wait this list is a little whack the weakest are 7)Ricky 8) gyuvin 9) taerae jiwoongs stiff but he's easily better than those 3

      <p>gunwook is easily the second best dancer imo. he really doesnâ€™t have flaws in his dance technique, the only thing is that its just a little typical? like he could develop it more to make it more unique but heâ€™s pretty great. Meanwhile matthew and yujin have more individuality but those aspects interfere with their executions of idol dances (iâ€™m not gonna go into it cuz iâ€™m lazy) but if honestly say those two are interchangeable based on what you prefer more in dancing (i like groovier dancing more so i personally put matthew over yujin). I also think that Ricky, gyuvin, and jiwoong are interchangeable tbh (with taerae obviously being last) they all struggle with different aspects of their technique. Id personally put ricky slightly above the other two cuz heâ€™s shown evidence of good isolations and details but yeah. tbh itâ€™s better to rank them in tiers since theyâ€™re interchangeable at times:

Tier 1: Hanbin
Tier 2: Gunwook
Tier 3: Matthew, Yujin
Tier 4: Hao
Tier 5: Ricky, Gyuvin, Jiwoong 
Tier 6: Taerae</p>

      <p>ouuuuuu I agree with this yea gunwook lacks some of that personality compared to dance line and I'd put Ricky slightly above those two as well

      <p>i dont like rickys facials which makes him tier 6 for me, gyuvin has bad facials but its not on purpose he just overfocues on the choreo, jiwoong is ok. but ricky facials give he doesnt understand the concept of every song well. even when he tries to switch it up and smile for lighthearted songs like in bloom and melting point (esp! melting point) i feel like he could still do much better and more natural. which is kinda contradicting his natural personality he is extremely soft, but maybe he thinks he must have strong facials on stage, maybe he doesnt want to ruin his image he always talks about that. hanbin too on a lesser level but his strong face just puts me off, heâ€™s okay with cuter concepts</p>

      <p>Ricky's makeup does all that work for him he doesn't have to do facials I feel like in bloom he just didn't know what to do. hanbin was sticking out like crazy in in bloom like he looks angry on stage half the time he eased up for mp tho
