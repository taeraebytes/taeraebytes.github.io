Gunwook has a tendency to over dance the moves and for dance training Matthew has longer training bt he lacks in details he is very old school dancer w hiphop moves bt not suitable for kpop dancing. And Jiwoong I used to rank him high in dancing bt after seeing his constant bad Performance specially his AAA dance break not a single move was done perfectly it lacked dynamics, details, groove everything. him and Taerae r probably the worst even Gyuvin Ricky actually does the move we can see the lines</p>

      <p>I think he overdances sometimes but not all the time it's more noticeable cuz usually only 1-2 can give off the power for that kinda choreo and yea matthew has that smoother style someone in here said it before jiwoong is off a perc and is being lazy he looked crazy at aaaðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I think gyuvin and Ricky just practiced really hard this time around maybe they did get better but jiwoong was always the better dancer to me but not by that muchðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
