      <p>yass u should stan riize they post a lot on ig and most of the times the members upload and post everything themselves (u can usually tell when a staff does it) and theyre also pretty active on tiktok and they do like actual trends and they have a cb in less than 2 weeks. they also update on weverse every now and then and they also upload content similar to zbtv i think weekly and also a documentary type series that shows a lot of bts like practicing and also whenever they go overseas (except we're boycotting everything from the past month cuz they edited seunghan out). i switched over a few months ago bc crush disappointed me sm and zb1 was starting to give me an ick a little and i havent looked back i still like a few members but i stopped updating myself on group activities and whatever i just use this cc to see if anything interesting happens. but i love ot7 riize and they all have such good chemistry and they're all really talented so if you're looking for a change i would recommend</p>

      <p>yeah, my only issue with them it's their vocals. but they take the lead when it comes to performances for now. riize performances has also been lackluster and at least we can say that zb1 have been doing some live but riize has been lipping all their performances.</p>

      <p>their vocals are so mid they all sound similar too but no one's rlly a singer in the group. But yea I'd say their mma perf was the only good one so far not much of a performance diff
