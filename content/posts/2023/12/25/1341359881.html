      <p>Its kinda funny seeing how Hanbinâ€™s Love me Right fancam was in the top 10 most viewed fancams of the year bc he will never be able to accomplish that again. He had more fans as a bp trainee than he does now as an idol</p>

      <p>At least he is doing well in it. What about Gunwook?. If we are being real, Hao Hanbin and Yujin are the only relevant members in the group.</p>
