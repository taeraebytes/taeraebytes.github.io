    "question": "Gunwook's best talent is rapping I think he has an outstanding rap tone and he has the grip of freestyle rapping too bt they doesn't have a single song where he got a proper rap verse that's the biggest key of skills bt he is not getting any chances to show I also kinda think his decision to choose growl was a bit off cs he really had a chance to pull of boy in luv since he rarely has the chances to show to rapping. If he or Taerae or Hao could have exchanged their roles the cover could have pretty well",
    "reply": "It really is I wish he had the chance to showcase it but zb1 are never gonna have rap detailed songs since he's the only one who can I think he chose growl cuz 1) just the better song 2) probably got in his own head ab never being able to rap I wish he did bil but oh well"
