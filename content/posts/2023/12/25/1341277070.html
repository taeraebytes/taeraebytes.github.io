      <p>yass u should stan riize they post a lot on ig and most of the times the members upload and post everything themselves (u can usually tell when a staff does it) and theyre also pretty active on tiktok and they do like actual trends and they have a cb in less than 2 weeks. they also update on weverse every now and then and they also upload content similar to zbtv i think weekly and also a documentary type series that shows a lot of bts like practicing and also whenever they go overseas (except we're boycotting everything from the past month cuz they edited seunghan out). i switched over a few months ago bc crush disappointed me sm and zb1 was starting to give me an ick a little and i havent looked back i still like a few members but i stopped updating myself on group activities and whatever i just use this cc to see if anything interesting happens. but i love ot7 riize and they all have such good chemistry and they're all really talented so if you're looking for a change i would recommend</p>

      <p>They are not lipsynching, their mma talk saxy performance was a bit messy and a lot happened in it and we can see that they sang live. Just because their live singing sounds good doesn't mean they are lip synching.</p>

      <p>do sm artists even sing live these days bc i feel like since a few years ago, maybe around the pandemic, there was a shift where they did those pre-recorded vocals all the time (the ones where they make it sound 'more real' by leaving in the breathing and such) and it's so Throwing Tomatos. this comparison is about to sound wild but hear me out, itzy aren't known for their vocals at all but they sing live quite a bit, have hard choreo and sound stable so why can't riize do that

also will never forgive their fans for saying they're better than zb1 vocally just bc they're from sm smh</p>

      <p>Nope it's been yrs since sm artists did a bunch of live stages it took aespa like a yr and a half to sing live and even that is rare and riize are easily the weakest vocal group sm has put out ðŸ˜­

      <p>what is this obsession with singing liveâ€¦.? iâ€™m sorry but why do u people want to hear ur faves being out of breath trying to hold a note and dancing at the same time like that wonâ€™t make the performance any better if anything zeroses shouldnâ€™t beg other groups to sing live when taerae sounds like a dying frog everytime he attempts to sing live</p>

      <p>I mean it's an age old standard in the industry plus if company's try to dupe backtracks as live stages don't you think it's because people are expecting live stages it's a lot less common now but back in the day you'd get tore the fuck up and nobodys begging anyone to sing live woah now
