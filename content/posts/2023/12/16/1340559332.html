      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more

      <p>again “threatening his popularity”  yujin is not in any way hanbin is the one who ranked 2 and hao 1 they are not going to be competing with the kid who ranked 9 and who won’t be on the same level when it comes to singing and dancing it’s literally that easy 😭</p>

      <p>the center is a huge part of their argument but yujins very popular wouldn't say threatening but he's one of the most in korea and second in china that smth hao fans and hanbin fans are always gonna be at each others throats and him coming in 9th is because his fans picked up slack to help jiwoong and gyuvin😭 but yujins a better dancer than hao wdym? But all I'm saying is they don't seem to care much ab yujin so they wouldn't even if gunwook got similarly popular 🧏‍♀️ they're always just gonna hate hanbin more

      <p>yujin is 2nd most known outside the fandom in korea, granted there is a huge gap between him and hanbin. but rosins think hao is bigger than he is bc he has the most dedicated fan base even tho it’s more like they live in a bubble</p>
