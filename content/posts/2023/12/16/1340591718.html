      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more

      <p>? bitch I gave u an inch don't take a mile like I'll start praying for downfalls.. hao fans don't even really hate yujin all that much and he's basically a center and even if they do it's where I can't see it so irdgafü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>again ‚Äúthreatening his popularity‚Äù  yujin is not in any way hanbin is the one who ranked 2 and hao 1 they are not going to be competing with the kid who ranked 9 and who won‚Äôt be on the same level when it comes to singing and dancing it‚Äôs literally that easy üò≠</p>

      <p>the center is a huge part of their argument but yujins very popular wouldn't say threatening but he's one of the most in korea and second in china that smth hao fans and hanbin fans are always gonna be at each others throats and him coming in 9th is because his fans picked up slack to help jiwoong and gyuvinüò≠ but yujins a better dancer than hao wdym? But all I'm saying is they don't seem to care much ab yujin so they wouldn't even if gunwook got similarly popular üßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they're always just gonna hate hanbin more

      <p>yujin is 2nd most known outside the fandom in korea, granted there is a huge gap between him and hanbin. but rosins think hao is bigger than he is bc he has the most dedicated fan base even tho it‚Äôs more like they live in a bubble</p>

      <p>girl you're tapped hao is literally so popular in korea just because you have allins screaming on twitter about how global members aren't known there doesn't mean it's true... his shit gets sold out and restocked the most his PCs are the most expensive be so for real yujin fans are all middle schoolers it's literally hanbin - hao - yujin in this order</p>

      <p>the way the brand rankings got announced and hao is ranked lower than yujin. fans have to realize that selling out things is NOT the same as overall popularity in a group, and thats fine</p>

      <p>That brand ranking list is basically just fraudulent you can fudge a lot of the stats with organized mass searching and tagging and a lot of stuff that should count towards the points gets lost apparently wonyoungs never made it to the #1 spot before even tho she is arguably the most endorsed and famously endorsed idol out rn you'll have bts members who haven't done shit in ages also be top3 it's a decent measure but also just not that accurate I'm sure yujin is actually higher tho since he had that sofio coppola event and hao only went to that w korea event very recently but just had to say that I wouldn't parade it too hard the br list is full of inaccuracies

      <p>Idols themselves have acknowledged br and I think if you look at whose at the top and how much opportunities they are receiving it makes sense</p>

      <p>I didn't say it was flat out wrong just full of inaccuracies which true wonyoung tops every brand and is the most promoted idol yet she's never once made it to the top like it rllt can be fudged to an extent and also a lot of data gets left out isn't it one person making this list

      <p>are some of y'all genuinely this mentally challenged how do you even have debates and arguments irl? saying the br lost is rigged is NOT equivalent to saying everyone who's at the top is a flop who should be at the bottom? are you fucking stupid it's a biased list with a lot of obscure data obviously fabricated for the sole purpose of pushing certain people but they're obviously not gonna push nugus at the same time the real popularity and demand irl doesn't match up entirely</p>
