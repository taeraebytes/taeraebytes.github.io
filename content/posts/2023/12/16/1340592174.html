      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more

      <p>? bitch I gave u an inch don't take a mile like I'll start praying for downfalls.. hao fans don't even really hate yujin all that much and he's basically a center and even if they do it's where I can't see it so irdgafü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      <p>again ‚Äúthreatening his popularity‚Äù  yujin is not in any way hanbin is the one who ranked 2 and hao 1 they are not going to be competing with the kid who ranked 9 and who won‚Äôt be on the same level when it comes to singing and dancing it‚Äôs literally that easy üò≠</p>

      <p>the center is a huge part of their argument but yujins very popular wouldn't say threatening but he's one of the most in korea and second in china that smth hao fans and hanbin fans are always gonna be at each others throats and him coming in 9th is because his fans picked up slack to help jiwoong and gyuvinüò≠ but yujins a better dancer than hao wdym? But all I'm saying is they don't seem to care much ab yujin so they wouldn't even if gunwook got similarly popular üßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they're always just gonna hate hanbin more

      <p>yujin is 2nd most known outside the fandom in korea, granted there is a huge gap between him and hanbin. but rosins think hao is bigger than he is bc he has the most dedicated fan base even tho it‚Äôs more like they live in a bubble</p>

      <p>girl you're tapped hao is literally so popular in korea just because you have allins screaming on twitter about how global members aren't known there doesn't mean it's true... his shit gets sold out and restocked the most his PCs are the most expensive be so for real yujin fans are all middle schoolers it's literally hanbin - hao - yujin in this order</p>

      <p>Yeah he gets more stocks for his stuffs even in South Korea, he sells out the fastest with Hanbin on Korean websites, he (surprisingly) gets again the most screams with Hanbin (and Ricky) during mushows, but Yujin is def more popular for middle schoolers tho; it really depends on the demographic</p>

      <p>Yes they're the most popular it's funny tho jiwoongs pc prices are still on the floor it's prob cuz he gets the most opportunities. actually is jiwoong even all that popular still? He's a visual and the gp likes him so I guess

      <p>I think Jiwoong lost most of his fans his fanbase isn't even comparable to Hanbin Hao Yujin they make up most of the fanbase I'm unsure who's after those 3 because the gap is really that big</p>
