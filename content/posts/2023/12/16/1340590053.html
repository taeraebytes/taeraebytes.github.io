      <p>It‚Äôs not possible for hanbin to face xenophobia in korea or the Korean industry but I think reading comprehension went over alot of people‚Äôs head. Op specifically said within this fandom and not the industry. Also just as a general people in the qrts need to educate themselves on what xenophobia is because all ethnic minorities can face xenophobia doesn‚Äôt matter where they are from, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Bangladeshi like literally anyone. Xenophobia means dear of something foreign or not usual to someone so yes people on the west can be very much xenophobic to all Asian people and other ethnic minorities. People need to stop mixing it up with the word Sinophobia which is excessive for people who are Chinese.</p>

      <p>no I got that part as well still didn't really make sense that would mean the other 7/9 members would face xenophobia in this fandom as well they're all Korean ethnically and people only really bring up hanbins ethnicity in retrospect to hao to bring up conversations of Sinophobia he may be experiencing. xenophobia wasnt the right word to use and it's just weird to say also because hanbin does have a privilege of not being a foreigner. I think what they should have said is people boil down his achievements to the fact that he's Korean which is wayyyyy different than what they said and the fact that nobody rlly is correcting them is justüò≠
