      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more

      <p>again “threatening his popularity”  yujin is not in any way hanbin is the one who ranked 2 and hao 1 they are not going to be competing with the kid who ranked 9 and who won’t be on the same level when it comes to singing and dancing it’s literally that easy 😭</p>

      <p>the center is a huge part of their argument but yujins very popular wouldn't say threatening but he's one of the most in korea and second in china that smth hao fans and hanbin fans are always gonna be at each others throats and him coming in 9th is because his fans picked up slack to help jiwoong and gyuvin😭 but yujins a better dancer than hao wdym? But all I'm saying is they don't seem to care much ab yujin so they wouldn't even if gunwook got similarly popular 🧏‍♀️ they're always just gonna hate hanbin more

      <p>Actually some professional dancers ranked Yujin lower than hao in dance line. Some Hanbin > Gunwook > Matthew > Hao > Yujin and some others Yujin > Hao. It’s just that Yujin has the chance to showcase his skills more and he is more praised for being younger but ig Hao trained even shorter than him. (Also Mama clearly showed Yujin still lacks a lot but he has potential)

      <p>Ik yujin started dancing like 3 yrs ago I'll watch these videos later but hao is kind of a more mediocre dancer like I don't see him as a dance member at all and dang I thought he rlly killed that mama dance he did so well 😳 he lacks still but he's young and hasn't danced much he honestly just doesn't try much on stage 
I also watched a diff video a few months ago from a professional dancer and their ranking went Hanbin>Gunwook>Yujin>Matthew>Hao I agree w this more tbh 
hao is good but yujin just seems more skilled

      <p>I think gunwook sings live 80% of the time he rlly sucks at lip syncing jiwoong you can tell when he does.... Matthew kind of you can tell when he gets to sounding whack on stage they all sing live a decent amt esp inkigayo music stages those are always live
