      <p>wonyoung has to be at least 174 cm, companies are lying about their height cause koreans like their women to be petite. its not that wonyoung is like lets lie about my height, its the companies.</p>

      <p>Well yea it's the companies but it's funny her being 174 on paper whether it's true or not messes up a lot of these male idols fake heights cuz she's just so tall if they had her down as 177 it would be easier for the males to height fish

      <p>koreans like their female idols being tall, one of the reasons why red velvet got chewed up during debut was bc of their heights. it's more about wonyoung not liking it, i remember how she would edit her pics during izone era to make her legs look shorter</p>

      <p>Hanbins a cool 177 hao is 180 and there's a clear diff between the two so she's probably 174 I mean 175 is only 1 cm off soðŸ˜­

      <p>hanbins roughly 177cm hao 181 as I just got cussed for sayinf 180 and gunwooks 185 I think you guys overestimate cms hao and hanbin are an inch apart 177 to 185 is not a foot it's like 3 inches at most and ngl it looks more than that sometimes esp since gunwook recently got taller than gyuvin but hanbin and jiwoong aren't that far apart either and he's like 175 which yes would make taerae and Matthew shorter than their official heights because they're also lying
