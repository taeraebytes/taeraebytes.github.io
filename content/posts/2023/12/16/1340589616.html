      <p>dude is def wearing ron desantis heels. I watched the red carpet yesterday and his boots were exactly like his and he was walking kinda janky. Also apparently knets are saying wonyoung is lying about her height and that shes 170 so hes prob even shorter than that</p>

      <p>wonyoung has to be at least 174 cm, companies are lying about their height cause koreans like their women to be petite. its not that wonyoung is like lets lie about my height, its the companies.</p>

      <p>Well yea it's the companies but it's funny her being 174 on paper whether it's true or not messes up a lot of these male idols fake heights cuz she's just so tall if they had her down as 177 it would be easier for the males to height fish
