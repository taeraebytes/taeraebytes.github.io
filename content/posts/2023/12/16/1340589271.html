      <p>Okay after watching zb1 kbs performance I only have few thing to say that zb1 did great but one of the lack lustre performance by them so far, I love that after they did mid cover their crush live was impressive bcoz lots of idol don’t even sing live nowadays at least they did also it was so clear when they skip & when they sang. Honestly taerae & zhang hao high note was the highligh tho everyone sang live,Yujin impressed me the most bcoz boy did sang live & he was good for someone who know for his weak vocal, I wish fans who attended kbs see their potential, also i’m sorry but honestly with no hard feeling jiwoong was off tho he had great visual but for K-pop he little cringe idk how to say this his moves & singing style is cringe that make zb1 little off as team, he great for model & ambassador to be real but as one of the bp master said jiwoong does exaggerated moves & vocal too much, don’t they watch their cam & think it’s too much or atleast their dance teacher should have tell him to not do too much, too much is never good.</p>

      <p>Tbh, I don't like Taerae's live high notes in Crush. He kinda screams out of tune</p>

      <p>They're not my style either but it can get lit sometimes I think there was only one award show where I liked when he hit the note higher
