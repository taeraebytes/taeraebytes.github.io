 00:27 and 00:49 The way Hao was done with Jiwoongs bullshit. Am I the only one who thinks like that. The way Haos smile fell (00:27) when Jiwoong brought up Matthew, the second time (00:49) was the time he started saying bye without looking if the others wanted to give a speech</p>

      <p>Him bringing Matthew into it who wasn't prepared was so terrible I think only hanbin was prepared to give an actual speech maybe with a ment or two in eng and Chinese from hao and Matthew like put the percs down...

      <p>i have a suspicion hao doesn‚Äôt fuck with jiwoong at all abd it‚Äôs kinda mutual,  hao just either looks so done with him most of the time or ignores him and even in their jeju episode of jw‚Äôs show their interactions felt very forced üò≠</p>

      <p>The jeju episode was odd and they're kind of weird with each other they play up to the cameras but they're so standoffish most of the time and that whole episode was just Chinese tourism anyways

      <p>there's also a video from the bts of that performance that it's like a 360 cam of them singing, and during one part hanbin and jiwoong were talking about how they had an argument and then gunwook or ricky (i don't really remember) was like since hanbin is younger he should apologize first, and hao face during the whole thing was so funny he was annoyed as hell, and then hanbin went for a hug and the other members were watching but hao didn't want to even look at that, he only stared at them when hanbin said something during the hug sjsjsj. he really can't stand jiwoong fr</p>

      <p>Do you remember in bp they asked hao why he dropped Keita and junghyun? Keita was because he faked being bad at Korean and Jung because he didn‚Äôt great him? He drops people so easily I‚Äôm crying (as he should). They should have asked why he never talks to jw</p>

      <p>He is a Leo with a cancer placement trust he holds silent grudges + if the whole bp trainees picked them as the most akward without knowing the backstory then it should have been noticeable (you could also notice during the pyjama party)</p>

      <p>hao messy asf who remember during overme when they were picking who did the killing part everyone chose between hao and keita (keita picked hao) but hao chose kuanjui even tho he sucked just to break the tie and give himself more votes (and get the kp)</p>

      <p>i don't think he did it to break the tie, hao always supported Kuanjui. for example, during ktl kuanjui was bad at his part and yet hao pushed for him to get that part while knowing damn well that it didn't fit him, hao is super loyal for friendships, he's not objective unlike hanbin who whacked mattew a lot of times during the show when he knew that matthew didn't deserve something üò≠</p>
