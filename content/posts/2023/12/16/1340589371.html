      <p>how are you ot8 anti hanbin when hanbin is objectively better in any sense that at least 4/8 of the group. i feel like the only members who people shouldn't exclude from ot9 are hanbin, hao and gunwook. imagine stanning gyuvin and jiwoong but shitting on hanbin</p>

      <p>haos psychotic fans don't run twitter that's all on weibo and they by the masses don't shit on gunwook so it's easy for me not to see much from them and hao fans (twitter) usually like the group somewhat gunwook even more

      <p>again “threatening his popularity”  yujin is not in any way hanbin is the one who ranked 2 and hao 1 they are not going to be competing with the kid who ranked 9 and who won’t be on the same level when it comes to singing and dancing it’s literally that easy 😭</p>

      <p>the center is a huge part of their argument but yujins very popular wouldn't say threatening but he's one of the most in korea and second in china that smth hao fans and hanbin fans are always gonna be at each others throats and him coming in 9th is because his fans picked up slack to help jiwoong and gyuvin😭 but yujins a better dancer than hao wdym? But all I'm saying is they don't seem to care much ab yujin so they wouldn't even if gunwook got similarly popular 🧏‍♀️ they're always just gonna hate hanbin more

      <p>yujin is 2nd most known outside the fandom in korea, granted there is a huge gap between him and hanbin. but rosins think hao is bigger than he is bc he has the most dedicated fan base even tho it’s more like they live in a bubble</p>

      <p>girl you're tapped hao is literally so popular in korea just because you have allins screaming on twitter about how global members aren't known there doesn't mean it's true... his shit gets sold out and restocked the most his PCs are the most expensive be so for real yujin fans are all middle schoolers it's literally hanbin - hao - yujin in this order</p>

      <p>the way the brand rankings got announced and hao is ranked lower than yujin. fans have to realize that selling out things is NOT the same as overall popularity in a group, and thats fine</p>

      <p>That brand ranking list is basically just fraudulent you can fudge a lot of the stats with organized mass searching and tagging and a lot of stuff that should count towards the points gets lost apparently wonyoungs never made it to the #1 spot before even tho she is arguably the most endorsed and famously endorsed idol out rn you'll have bts members who haven't done shit in ages also be top3 it's a decent measure but also just not that accurate I'm sure yujin is actually higher tho since he had that sofio coppola event and hao only went to that w korea event very recently but just had to say that I wouldn't parade it too hard the br list is full of inaccuracies

      <p>if fandoms can mess with the stats, why do you think the zb1 members arent higher? if there is a way to mess with it. it makes no sense for them to be so low</p>

      <p>Zb1 as a group aren't even low on the boy group ranking but those other groups and idols just get talked ab wayyyyy more than the mass searching that can get done but this list has been proven time and time again to be inaccurate also barely anyone refers to it anymore I feel like before zb1 I hadn't seen that thing in yrs
