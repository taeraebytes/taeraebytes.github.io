      <p>makes sense two debuts after the newest group not even being a yr old sounds messy

      <p>do we think it'll end up delaying until 2025/2026 and theres a chance they're waiting for yujin/time to try and buy out his contract. he was contacted by sm a few times before bp and he'll be 18 when the group disbands</p>

      <p>that's possible sm does the most with delaying their groups waiting for yujin would be crazy I could see him being in it but ugh I don't want it to happen
