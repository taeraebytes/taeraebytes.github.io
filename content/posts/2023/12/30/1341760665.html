      <p>i think yujinâ€™s dancing is smoother and gunwookâ€™s is stronger, so it suites idol dances more + his skills are more polished</p>

      <p>ok my dance ranking:
hanbin 
wall 
gunwook (strong dancer) 
yujin (suits contemporary style) 
matthew (has a lot of groove) - the dance line, have diff strong and weak points
wall 
hao (hasnâ€™t developed his own style yet, but executes the moves well and has musicality and stays in sync)
wall
ricky (idk heâ€™s okay mostly)
wall
jiwoong (his biggest problem is that he seems resistent to improving and canâ€™t be in sync with others)
gyuvin (needs to learn how to control his limbs which weird bc im pretty sure he did ballet as a kid )
taerae (just doesnâ€™t have much dance training)</p>

      <p>i agree but i think gunwook - matthew changes on the context. matthew is the best at hip hop (honestly out of everyone in the whole group), yujin is good at contemporary and modern dance where isolations r important, gunwook is best at like idol dance so id put all 3 on the same tier roughly</p>

      <p>Yea there's something they're all better than the others at they're close and none of them have extensive dance experience which is impressive also one of the other reason gunwook and yujin are put above matthew is cuz of their proportions
