      <p>taerae solo I doubt it but we'll see and crush? Hmmm it suits like a classical rendition but band? And esp with an acoustic guitar would sound terrible

      <p>They're definitely not going to play live when kbands themselves can't. It's probably going to be them singing live while handsyncing the instruments with the backing track</p>
