      <p>taerae solo I doubt it but we'll see and crush? Hmmm it suits like a classical rendition but band? And esp with an acoustic guitar would sound terrible

      <p>I think he's good and a lot of the hype is around how short he's been doing it and his license I don't think he's like first chair tho

      <p>As someone who plays the violin he’s definitely not like the most amazing violin player in the world, he probably wouldn’t be at a professional level either in terms of skill however he is really impressive considering he didn’t learn for a long amount of time and he got himself to a high enough level where he was able to qualify to teach violin aswell.</p>
