 yujin saying he doesn't talk to his little brother often makes this vid worse somehow it''s like he's probs doesn't see him often because he's been a trainee for such a long time and he's interacting with him for like the 4th time total this year and it's being marred by crazy zeroses :/ (maybe he was just joking when talking about his lil bro idk im not close with my siblings so i took it as face value ðŸ˜­)</p>
