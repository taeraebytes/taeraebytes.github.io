 yujin saying he doesn't talk to his little brother often makes this vid worse somehow it''s like he's probs doesn't see him often because he's been a trainee for such a long time and he's interacting with him for like the 4th time total this year and it's being marred by crazy zeroses :/ (maybe he was just joking when talking about his lil bro idk im not close with my siblings so i took it as face value ðŸ˜­)</p>

      <p>What's their age gap? I saw that he said they fought a lot and that they greeted each other which sounds awks and when someone asked who his lil bros fav member is he said "I dont think he's interested" which is weird because usually people would say "he's not interested" but to say "I don't think" confirms to me they're not close at all or at least he doesn't know much about his brother.</p>
