      <p>wait ok lemme run with this 

Gunwook- Chaeyoung (minus the problematicness ofc) cuz theyâ€™re both main rappers and the only good rappers in their group but have to share their rap lines anyways 

Jiwoong-Sana both gay4pay (love sana tho itâ€™s cute when she flirts with the members)

Yujin- Mina both quiet and have elegant dance styles

Gyuvin- Dahyun both default second rappers and are interesting individuals 

Matthew- Momo ig cuz theyâ€™re the only ones left ðŸ˜­ i mean theyâ€™re both good dancers but Matthew isnâ€™t on the level of Momo at all so idk not much other similarities 

not perfect parallels but still fun to do

donâ€™t hate me for this i like both twice and zb1</p>
