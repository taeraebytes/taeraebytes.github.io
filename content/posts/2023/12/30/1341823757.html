      <p>Zb1 is doing a band version of Fry’s Dream by akmu and they were recording today. Some Zeroses went and revealed the line distribution and basically the 1st chorus is sung by hanbin-Gunwook and 2nd is sung by jiwoong-Hao. 
The lines Hanbin sings in the first chorus is exactly the same jiwoong sing in the second chorus but some kultaraes got mad because Taerae doesn’t sing the chorus and they blamed wakeone for pushing hanbin to sing the chorus when literally the chorus is sung by 4 people of the group and Jiwoong and hanbin sings the exact same lines.
It’s exhausting.</p>
