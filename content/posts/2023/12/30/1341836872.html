      <p>the tweet got deleted but someone posted this video of hanbin's melting point high note and i actually had to turn my volume down. i wish i was able to screen record before it was gone because idk where it was from i never had heard it before and it was bad. i'm not a fan of taerae's voice but he only strains because the company gives parts none of them can sing well but he manages to sound fine most of the time
if anyone wants to help me find that video they were in their white outfits and even hanbin made a face after he was done singing he knew he fucked up LMAOOO</p>
