      <p>yeah but the problem wasnâ€™t with puppy it was with poop and i understand him not wanting to be associated with it, anyways only in kpop you will see an idol having an official animal representative and starting a huge debate on what it should be ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I know but I'm saying he used pooppuppy and referred to himself as it a lot of peoples gripes is that he's trying to change his own rep animal when it's fan assigned 90% of the time

      <p>hoshi is different because his obsession with tigers is so large that he comes across as a whole kinnie and it's so funny that even non-carats such as myself are aware of it. gyuvin's deer agenda will not spread to kfans because despite his oddities he is not a furry and therefore him rebranding is not interesting enough for the rebranding to stick</p>
