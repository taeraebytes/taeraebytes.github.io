    "question": "is she the translator who got exposed as a shipper in her priv? i personally don’t see anything wrong with what she did though? even if u have something against rps it’s not like she was pushing her rps agenda onto the members, all her rps tweets are private so🤷‍♀️ if anything i find it more concerning that someone thought it’s okay to just screenshot and share private tweets to “expose” someone. i feel like because fans are so young in zerosetwt it feels stricter with rps spaces and so many younger fans act like it’s taboo and “cancel” others for it, meanwhile in other kpop fandoms u could pass around fics in broad daylight and nobody gaf. i’ve seen twitter aus for other fandoms’ rps ships gaining like 10k likes and everyone just knows how to stay in their lane",
    "reply": "yea but my gripe with her was her and her whole friend group having something against gunwook I actually never really cared ab the other stuff plus that was the first time which was months agoooooooo. also she came for my friend when everyone was jumping her like irdc what she does that's not my business."
