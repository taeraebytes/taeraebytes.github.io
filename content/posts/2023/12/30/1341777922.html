      <p>am i the only one who thinks wonbin ugly💀 what’s up with his cheeks and jaw when he smiles?? it’s giving jigsaw (the villain in jigsaw 2017) i’m sorry. knetz’s aesthetics are so weird. and idk anything about his talents except he plays the guitar but i thought his guitar solo at mma seemed kinda fake (like they put a backtrack and he pretended to play)? does anyone know if he’s talented or a dozen because all i see are people praising his visuals which doesn’t do anything for me. he’s short asf too like it really ruins his vibes i’m just waiting for the day he stands next to zb1 and everyone realizes he’s not the 5th gen it boy sm is trying to market him as and literally anyone in zb1 looks better</p>

      <p>It's a matter of preference I think he's good looking but ouh that filler but he's not thee visual of his group either. he's just seen as hot and fresh so thats why he blew up so fast I think people prefer eunseok and sungchans visuals as like visual. I'm ngl he's up there but it rlly was a bunch of marketing too I think some of his hype fell thru when he started getting dragged for his height but I don't care ab riize ngl I don't wanna talk ab them anymore
