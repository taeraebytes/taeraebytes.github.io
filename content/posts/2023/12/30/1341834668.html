      <p>Even cricky fans are saying Gyuvin is selfish and doesnt care about Ricky feelings but international Ricky fans want to defend Gyuvin, personally im not a strict person about how friends act but when ur a celeb you need to know limits .. Gyuvin needs to keep things offline I also get uncomfortable seeing how he acts on bubble or live , cause hes incosiderate about Ricky saying no and that makes  uncomfy to watch even if they are friends and know their own boundaries . keep it offline</p>
