      <p>what gives off the vibe that he has an older married sugar daddy???? ur other ask mentions plastic surgery and can i just say that whatever he did with his nose/face kinda lowered his looks a bit like something just looks so off now.. his face looks longer, he looked so cutie patootie before</p>

      <p>This is troll but my friend had a tarot reading done from someone who wasn't a fan (I don't believe in tarots) and it was reallly detailed and the person reading said specific things that it's a man older than chanhee veerrrrry affluent and has a family but when he was with chanhee he was separated but then he got back tgthr with the wife or smth. this got HUGE on deobi twt in 2019 because chanhee started posting like really expensive things and a TV GIFT saying a friend got it for him mind u tbz we're broke as fuck and just other coincidences I'm pretty sure she dug around too idk but this had my community wrecked it's just interesting. And yea he messed with his face too much please take the implant out and let's regain that jaw through filler
