    "question": "O wow I'm reading about the parasite actor $uicide on a kforum, at first I thought the whole scandal was because he did drugs and reporters wrote fake articles about him going to brothels but turns out he just smoked some weed and took sleeping pills so I was confused why he went to that extent but apparently the brothel was true and there's a leaked an audio of clip of him doing it.\n\n\"It's shameful that the transcript was exposed... It wasn't just an article saying he went to a brothel, engaged in prostitution, or had an affair, but an audio clip of him having sex with a prostitute and confessing to her that he liked her was on the news.\"\n\ndamn.. they broadcasted it on the news for the entire nation to see and hear. wtf",
    "reply": "Oh this is so shocking I saw a bunch of articles when the drug allegations first dropped I actually had no clue he took his life till nowðŸ˜§ it's very irresponsible to release all that evidence to the public and broadcast it on national television... what did they think he was going to do this is worse than just serving silently his life was ruined I don't support it but it didn't have to go this far [EDIT] so I read up more on the situation he was involved in trafficking and the brothels he visited almost always were full of young almost minor girls so erm I take it back this. I initially said that I didn't support his actions but it didn't have to go this far but he seemed to have been running from what he did I don't feel sympathy anymore tbh"
