      <p>the show definitely didnâ€™t like them equally but they were obsessed with them as a duo ðŸ˜­ i mean they obv wanted hanbin to win to the point they revealed he was third on interim ranking, but yeah hao is not 8/9 i think being the center and his fandom having big buying power helps him in comparison to ricky</p>

      <p>Ok maybe yea they def didn't want hao winning first that's for sure but hao is treated like a center more and more and I think it's great his fandom and popularity is helping him wakeone is just a terrible company but he's doing all right definitely not even close to the bottom
