      <p>Ok youve just lost your mind because jay was by far the most talented vocalist on that show aside from hui he can sing laps around taerae please..... and he had hui sweating he's arguably neck and neck with that man

      <p>jay was straining those chords half of the show, the only thing he has on his side its his vocal tone but the second best vocalist on that show was seungeon and zb1 fans need to stop pretending that taerae and zh are at seungeon level</p>

      <p>Over me was still one of the best stages because of his vocals jay is strong his stamina is probably shite and seungeon is good but not that good cong was the better vocalist in the kvg battles he is better than zh and taerae but that's not my fight
