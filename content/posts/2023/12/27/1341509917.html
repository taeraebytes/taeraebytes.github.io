      <p>i said it was fucked up because i know most people wouldn't agree but i am 100% serious about this ðŸ˜­ and for more clarification i find taerae / gunwook attractive almost all of the time, hanbin is like 40% of the time depends on the day, yujin and gyuvin once in a blue moon, and the rest occasionally</p>
