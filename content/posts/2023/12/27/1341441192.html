      <p>just saw this from an allin cc 

"Requeefiem doesn't want to reply to my cc but she started shit first by telling how it is always Hanbin who is favored by that flop company, said how Hanbin is not relevant internationally and now she is acting all normal about all this. Bitch should go back to the trash where she belongs and stop speaking about Hanbin. Starting shit and then pretending to be all innocent. Hanbin stans aren't as loud and whiny as they want to be but not me though. I need that bitch and the people in her cc gone"
