      <p>Ok youve just lost your mind because jay was by far the most talented vocalist on that show aside from hui he can sing laps around taerae please..... and he had hui sweating he's arguably neck and neck with that man

      <p>seungeon was more korean fan favorite than like half of the members were,  and Junhyeon has a gunwook type of face that the grandma's like</p>

      <p>woah and no seungeon wasn't that popular not more than half of the members because with the Korean compiled votes 8/9 members were still in the top 9 it was phanbin? I think that was the only other person who made it off Korean voting

      <p>here's the ranking from the third elimination (since mnet never released the finale info ðŸ™„): 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/taeraevize/status/1646511597500915715"></a>
</blockquote>

only the bottom three of the korean top 9 are not zb1 members. the zb1 members that weren't in the top 9 were obviously ricky (k13), gunwook (k14), and matthew (k16)
the non-zb1 members who were in the k top 9 were seungeon (k07), kamden k08 (i forgot about that), junhyeon k09. phanbin was k10.

side note keita g01 k17 is insane ðŸ˜­ like i was here during bp i remembered he wasn't liked by korean fans but i forgot the difference was THAT big jfc 

actually crazy that if boys planet was based on just korean votes like produce (except not rigged...) kamden might've been in the group IMO he's not very idol-like. also hao taerae and seungeon in the same group would've been great if you ignore the kkultarae and whatever seungeon fans are called like OK vocal slayage! junhyeon too (even tho he's more lead vocal than main) but i think if the show was just based off of k-votes phanbin would've been p09 instead of junhyeon 

phanbin and gyuvin in the same group is funny to imagine they would've caused controversies in different ways. gyuvin makes his homophobic joke on live next day phanbin is "playfully" making fun of his ed sheeran cover on bbl</p>

      <p>Oh yea third elims made me wanna kill myself but we got it back in bloooooood and placed in k and g rankings but yea the group honestly would've only had 1-2 members off when it came to just korean votes which I think is pretty good. the lineup would've been successful with Kamden making it would be interesting but he suits the group more than junhyeon seungeon and phanbin which I think would've made them less popular and keita was just a USB so nobody wanted him in
