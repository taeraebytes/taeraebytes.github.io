      <p>the show definitely didnâ€™t like them equally but they were obsessed with them as a duo ðŸ˜­ i mean they obv wanted hanbin to win to the point they revealed he was third on interim ranking, but yeah hao is not 8/9 i think being the center and his fandom having big buying power helps him in comparison to ricky</p>

      <p>Ok maybe yea they def didn't want hao winning first that's for sure but hao is treated like a center more and more and I think it's great his fandom and popularity is helping him wakeone is just a terrible company but he's doing all right definitely not even close to the bottom

      <p>him being shown on that interim ranking would've been worse for him, the reason why a lot of the g group from GP dropped was bc koreans voted for the k groups contestants when they saw how well some c and j group contestants were doing on the ranking. 

I think mnet wanted hao to be #2 on the final rank and through the show they were too worried about hao not dropping that they accidentally pushed him more than hanbin, I remember hao being #2 in screentime on the whole show just behind Matthew, and I also remember during the concept song mission how both hanbin and him were leaders and they showed the shortcomings the two of them had as leaders but for Hao they ended up setting a whole arc redemption scene with Solji about how he could become a better leader meanwhile with Hanbin they didn't redeem anything.</p>
