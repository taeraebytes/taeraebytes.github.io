      <p>nah it's not even boredom I seriously think anon and their oomf has an obsession issue that needs to be checked. Like you guys are going so far digging for things that's not directly related to him at all and bringing it here for no reason to gossip when they're just living their daily life.

At least gossip about things that's directly related to the members like idc about their cousins who they probably see once a year and 0 if they weren't related at all.</p>
