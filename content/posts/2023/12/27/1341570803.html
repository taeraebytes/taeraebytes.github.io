      <p>Ok youve just lost your mind because jay was by far the most talented vocalist on that show aside from hui he can sing laps around taerae please..... and he had hui sweating he's arguably neck and neck with that man

      <p>woah and no seungeon wasn't that popular not more than half of the members because with the Korean compiled votes 8/9 members were still in the top 9 it was phanbin? I think that was the only other person who made it off Korean voting
