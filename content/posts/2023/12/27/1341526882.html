      <p>wonder how long this cc is going to last are we going to gossiping our way through zb1 disbandment. also i wonder if other fandoms also have a huge-ish (as in you only have like 150 followers but also 3.7k answers so idek) gossipy side or if zeroses are just weird</p>

      <p>I will honestly keep going till I get bored I really don't want things to get any bigger than they are I'm fine with being active but when the wrong people come to my cc it's annoying like this wasn't for you.... and gossip ccs have always existed I've seen a few over the years I just feel like zeroses found out a bunch cuz they can't shut their mouths but it's not like a lot have anyways

      <p>i know ncity has a lot, definitely way more than with zeroses, idk about other fandoms. i don't think there's too many carat ones and the bts ones are probably from solo stans or people who are on 'lurker' twt lmao. i feel like stays probably have a gossipy side but idk that's just a vibe since they're extremely annoying and big in fandom size</p>
