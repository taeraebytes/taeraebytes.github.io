      <p>ok um please not karina and gunwook she is 23 he is 18 and a minor in korea still. plus isn‚Äôt it custom for the guys to be older or at least the same age in korea. so like the maknae from nmixx i think shes 06 or another 05/06 liner idol. also had this random thought but i feel like leeseo and yujin would b cute and they‚Äôre both 07. i hope they‚Äôre at least friends cuz they go to school tgt and they‚Äôre in the same grade and it‚Äôs so difficult to be an idol/in the spotlight at that age and it‚Äôs nice to have someone who understands what ur going through. like ik leeseo is basically bullied and has no friends and yujin got harassed a lot while bp was airing and probably still does when he shows up. also leeseo seems pretty reserved (at least when she‚Äôs not around her members) and yujin is soft and quiet so they seem like they would click and not like overwhelm each other</p>
