      <p>yeah, wakeone love matthew. the member wakeone always push are matthew, hanbin, and jiwoong. if u saw detective jiwoong episode, his every client will come to the show. only ricky who didnt appear on tanghulu, but they choose hanbin and matthew instead. also for popular programme, they will put matthew beside hanbin, like amazing saturday 1st batch (which show only hanbin matthew jiwoong) and k star next door, also being an mc despite sometime he has difficulty read the korean text. also he always has decent amount on zb1 bts.</p>

      <p>also if they were trying to suggest that ricky should have gotten it, heâ€™s significant worse at reading korean and isnâ€™t even fluent. if they wanted a rookie tho i feel like they shouldâ€™ve gotten anton cuz heâ€™s fully fully bilingual and doesnâ€™t have any difficulty reading korean. anyways im happy for matt why r zeroses so miserable when one of the members get an opportunity i never see yall smiling ever. maybe itâ€™s cuz i donâ€™t go there but i get excited when i see a zb1 member get a gig w my faves or for something iâ€™ll be perceiving, especially matt hanbin and yujin those 3 r my pookies</p>
