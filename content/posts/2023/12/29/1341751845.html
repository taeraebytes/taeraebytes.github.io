      <p>taerae solo I doubt it but we'll see and crush? Hmmm it suits like a classical rendition but band? And esp with an acoustic guitar would sound terrible

      <p>if you know the basics about an instrument I believe that it's possible to learn how to play a song even if you are not an expert on the instrument, but you would need to practice at least 4 hours daily during one week.</p>
