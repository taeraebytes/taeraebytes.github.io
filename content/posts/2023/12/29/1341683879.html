      <p>yeah, wakeone love matthew. the member wakeone always push are matthew, hanbin, and jiwoong. if u saw detective jiwoong episode, his every client will come to the show. only ricky who didnt appear on tanghulu, but they choose hanbin and matthew instead. also for popular programme, they will put matthew beside hanbin, like amazing saturday 1st batch (which show only hanbin matthew jiwoong) and k star next door, also being an mc despite sometime he has difficulty read the korean text. also he always has decent amount on zb1 bts.</p>
