 yujin saying he doesn't talk to his little brother often makes this vid worse somehow it''s like he's probs doesn't see him often because he's been a trainee for such a long time and he's interacting with him for like the 4th time total this year and it's being marred by crazy zeroses :/ (maybe he was just joking when talking about his lil bro idk im not close with my siblings so i took it as face value ðŸ˜­)</p>

      <p>Seeing stuff from his bbl live they just don't seem close it could be from him training but I've never seen someone be this estranged from his sibling he doesn't mess w that kid
