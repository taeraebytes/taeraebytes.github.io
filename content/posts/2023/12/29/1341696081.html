      <p>ok um please not karina and gunwook she is 23 he is 18 and a minor in korea still. plus isnâ€™t it custom for the guys to be older or at least the same age in korea. so like the maknae from nmixx i think shes 06 or another 05/06 liner idol. also had this random thought but i feel like leeseo and yujin would b cute and theyâ€™re both 07. i hope theyâ€™re at least friends cuz they go to school tgt and theyâ€™re in the same grade and itâ€™s so difficult to be an idol/in the spotlight at that age and itâ€™s nice to have someone who understands what ur going through. like ik leeseo is basically bullied and has no friends and yujin got harassed a lot while bp was airing and probably still does when he shows up. also leeseo seems pretty reserved (at least when sheâ€™s not around her members) and yujin is soft and quiet so they seem like they would click and not like overwhelm each other</p>

      <p>The thing is Yujin and Leeseo are both very busy and rarely go to school, and right now is probably too obviois if they became close at school rumors could spread ,, but tbh judging from yujin old asks he had many female friends his middle school and he wasnt introverted at all i guess now hes a big idol that sadly had to change</p>

      <p>yujin, gyuvin and hao have a normal school life. make a friends with a boy and girl, hangout w friends or even dating. the thing is you clearly can see yujin acts so different when heâ€™s with his friend and when heâ€™s with zb1 while gyuvin..he acts the sameðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ so yeah, many fans still shock about that fact</p>

      <p>His friends? I haven't seen him interact with friends so I don't see the diff but I'm sure it's there he has his boundaries and yea gyuvin is the same he kind of has no social cues the way he treats everyone the same

      <p>I think just from anecdotes when he was in Boys Planet he defo was one of the popular good looking kids and he enjoyed it most idols at that age are either trainees or just cautious but u know he dated openly and so did gyuvin, so their fans are always a bit crazy in the head</p>
