      <p>we get mnet and cjenm payola. hao mama intro, yujin mama special stage, their mama budget was huge, the my first mama thing, u could argue the aaa mc thing cuz it was mnet produce centers. zb1 also went on amazing saturday and k star next door (both owned by cjenm) as a full group for their debut promotions. full groups don’t get sent to these unless they have 4 members, even txt only sent 3. if u look at riize this is their first variety promo after 4 months so like be grateful for the payola 😭😭😭 you quiz is also owned by cjenm but they don’t rly invite idol groups there</p>
