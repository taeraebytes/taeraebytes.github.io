      <p>yall families cannot payola it comes from companies ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ yoon sang is pretty known in the music industry but i donâ€™t think heâ€™s as big or has the authority yall think. definitely part of the reason theyâ€™re there cuz itâ€™s a family special i think but he canâ€™t pay the show to guest riize thatâ€™s now how it works. pretty sure heâ€™s beefing w sm/riize anyway cuz they never credited anton for get a guitar and he also just doesnâ€™t acknowledge riizeâ€™s existence. whenever he talks abt anton itâ€™s just family anecdotes or antons personal music like how he composed for that one movie</p>
