      <p>i’m not even a moa nor do i like yeonjun but he’s still pretty big? like he’s the most followed 4th gen idol i think and he gets a lot of interactions and viral moments. i’ve seen several tiktok’s of his 3d cover from a few days ago on my fyp that were close to or over 1m likes. i personally thought txt started tanking bc i stopped paying attention to them after the jonas brothers collab bc i didn’t like the direction they were going w their music but objectively they’re the biggest 4th gen bg rn and yeonjun is like the face of their group and a lot of ppl seem to like him. like ik they performed at the vmas they r definitely big even if u don’t think so 

in terms of wonbin, i wouldn’t compare him to yeonjun bc he started trending snd gaining attention from the minute he was revealed: probably the fastest i’ve seen a male idol get this much interest in a minute especially since bgs haven’t had a solid grasp on the sk market since 3rd gen. like i’ve seen wonbin get mentioned a lot on random variety shows or articles, and his group just debuted. with yeonjun, he didn’t rly gain the spotlight until 2021like txt had a rly rocky start like their first cb got delayed for so long bc of the injury which caused them to lose like half their fans (aka bts stan’s tuning in cuz they were the first group after bts to debut under bighit before hybe existed), and then the pandemic happened. txts original concept was also just very childish but with blue hour and then ikily they shifted their imagine and that’s when ppl started paying attention. i wouldn’t compare wonbin to wonyoung yet, but in terms of newer gen/younger male idols he does have a lot of potential. twitter is just a tiny portion of the internet, if he can cement himself domestically, he’s kind of set. ik him and the rest of riize just finished shooting for one of the biggest variety shows currently in sk (the only other groups that have been on it were bts, newjeans, and i think maybe gidle or ive) 

god sorry i keep sending thee long ass ccs and rambling i just upped my adderall dose and i am physically incapable of not writing essays if u actually read all this u are incredible</p>

      <p>Omg please cut it down I seriously cant do this wonbin got a lot of buzz but also a lot of paid promo I think he's going to have a similar fall to every other proclaimed it boy there's not a single thing protecting him from it and he went from getting praises to dragged within a day but we'll see how things go sm definitely is going to take a turn and switch their push to sungchan just watch
