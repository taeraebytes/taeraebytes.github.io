      <p>ok um please not karina and gunwook she is 23 he is 18 and a minor in korea still. plus isnâ€™t it custom for the guys to be older or at least the same age in korea. so like the maknae from nmixx i think shes 06 or another 05/06 liner idol. also had this random thought but i feel like leeseo and yujin would b cute and theyâ€™re both 07. i hope theyâ€™re at least friends cuz they go to school tgt and theyâ€™re in the same grade and itâ€™s so difficult to be an idol/in the spotlight at that age and itâ€™s nice to have someone who understands what ur going through. like ik leeseo is basically bullied and has no friends and yujin got harassed a lot while bp was airing and probably still does when he shows up. also leeseo seems pretty reserved (at least when sheâ€™s not around her members) and yujin is soft and quiet so they seem like they would click and not like overwhelm each other</p>

      <p>noona kinks are a thing. I heard theres a phenomena rn with young adult men where they go for older women cuz most of them have their life settled down or know what they want. Kinda like back in the day when younger women would go for older dudes.</p>
