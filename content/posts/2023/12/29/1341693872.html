      <p>gonna get booed for this or told to move on cuz crush came out months ago but take my hand should’ve been the title. it’s longer, the song has proper structure it doesn’t feel rushed in any way, it fits better w their og concept, and the drum and bass sound is what’s popular rn so it would’ve done well with maintaining their current audience as well as garnering new fans, especially among the gp. idc if they wanted to try different concepts or music styles that’s not how marketing works. they’re not at a point where they have impact to create trends they have to follow what’s currently in to maintain their popularity until they have a solid and consistent audience/reach. it feels like crush tried to go for a knock off savage concept but 1. only aespa can pull off aespa and sm has a great team of producers that can make that sort of music not sound cheap they’re rly good at mixing and layering and playing w vocals to bring out the instrumentals 2. noise was more of a 2020-2021 sound/trend (a lot of groups r still doing it but there’s been a gradual or subtle shift). take my hand also just feels like title track material, in terms of actual production it seems to have the highest quality sound off the entire album imo, and there’s even a dance break so it would’ve been great for music show promotions, it’s also rly upbeat and not boring like they have choreo for it they performed it at mama. i just genuinely don’t think there is anything that could justify why they went with crush. i personally think crush should’ve been scrapped altogether since it doesn’t even fit with the rest of the songs on the album. i get they’re a produce group and they have to move fast w cbs but melting point didn’t feel cohesive at all and it just feels so low quality 🙁 idc if everyone else has moved on, the first cb is probably the most important to rly cement themselves and i think they’ve sabotaged their entire career with this one decision. i firmly believe take my hand could’ve charted and done rly well if it was the title. obviously there r still a lot of opportunities to make better musical decisions and release things ppl will like, but that rly stopped their momentum. i would like to hear others opinions on this though (like seminar style juseyo)</p>

      <p>goddamn........ tmh was nice I didn't like it at first but everyone really seemed too and its just the right amount of boring that it would be a hit on the charts I think the 1st cb going bad hindered them but it might make their lick back even better if they do second cb right 👀 and almost every survival show group had a flop first cb
