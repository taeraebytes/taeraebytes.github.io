      <p>i think yujinâ€™s dancing is smoother and gunwookâ€™s is stronger, so it suites idol dances more + his skills are more polished</p>

      <p>ok my dance ranking:
hanbin 
wall 
gunwook (strong dancer) 
yujin (suits contemporary style) 
matthew (has a lot of groove) - the dance line, have diff strong and weak points
wall 
hao (hasnâ€™t developed his own style yet, but executes the moves well and has musicality and stays in sync)
wall
ricky (idk heâ€™s okay mostly)
wall
jiwoong (his biggest problem is that he seems resistent to improving and canâ€™t be in sync with others)
gyuvin (needs to learn how to control his limbs which weird bc im pretty sure he did ballet as a kid )
taerae (just doesnâ€™t have much dance training)</p>

      <p>i agree but i think gunwook - matthew changes on the context. matthew is the best at hip hop (honestly out of everyone in the whole group), yujin is good at contemporary and modern dance where isolations r important, gunwook is best at like idol dance so id put all 3 on the same tier roughly</p>
