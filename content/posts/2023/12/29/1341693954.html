      <p>also gyuvin and sungchan are like polar opposites like while i didn't pay attention to him at all in nct to me he seemed like polite elegant kinda self-conscious boy he definitely isn't gonna start suddenly talking about people coming out of the closet like im a bit offended by the comparison</p>
