      <p>yeah but the problem wasn’t with puppy it was with poop and i understand him not wanting to be associated with it, anyways only in kpop you will see an idol having an official animal representative and starting a huge debate on what it should be 😭</p>

      <p>I know but I'm saying he used pooppuppy and referred to himself as it a lot of peoples gripes is that he's trying to change his own rep animal when it's fan assigned 90% of the time

      <p>Ok maybe it's cuz I'll say play but I mean literally I'll play with my friends not hangout but it's just a context clue ig because I'm an English speaker it doesn't come off that jarring. Also it might have a different connotation in your culture
