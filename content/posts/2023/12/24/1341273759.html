      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>probably why mama was the most put together but they don't have a dance teacher? I swear I've heard them talk ab one I wouldnt be surprised if they just had commissioned choreographers and that's it

      <p>its common for non-big4 idols to not have dance teacher esp zb1 since they never practiced under wakeone , i predict they learn choreo with whoever drafts their choreo and theyre on their own afterwards. I also stan ive and they said they havent had a single dance lesson since debut and yujin leads if they are practicing. except for special stage like mama i guess its like that for zb1 it would be great if they had a performance director/allocated dance teacher, its actually the reason why izone had amazing synchronisation, hyewon the worst dancer said she owed so much to them</p>

      <p>they get choreos from the choreographers they probably lay down the important parts (this is only sometimes) then its up to them to watch the demos and dance members take the lead its kind of like how they were learning and doing stuff in bp 
in some cases theyll have actual people teach them spella taught gunwook and hanbin their choreo instead of them to learning on their own

      <p>Taerae already does start earlier than others a staff member literally said so in an interview also cut him some slack he started dancing when he was around 19 so obviously he cannot be compared to the members who have been dancing for years now and he's already improved a lot since debut anyway</p>
