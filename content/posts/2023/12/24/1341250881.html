      <p>on what rps side and from what shippers because you could literally say the same about gyuvin lovebombing ricky on the daily.. the majority of them engages in extreme yaoi fan service so why only focus on one person when all of them have said questionable stuff for yaoi fanservice even your bias has lmaooo</p>
