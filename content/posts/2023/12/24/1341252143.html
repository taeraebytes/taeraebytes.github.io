      <p>I meant like popular and a visual hes definitely not that because he's the least popular visual member so the demand for him is lower

      <p>Visually majority of the fandom prefer Hanbin hao ricky and Yujin? And outside the fandom people are always gagged by c-line visuals I think (based on their tweets that go really really viral);</p>

      <p>damn didnt know hao is that popular in the visual department i mean he's very pretty to me but i don't see a lot of zeroses treating him like a visual... also mattie is a lil too high for my likng anon you might wanna get serious and reconsider your ranking.</p>

      <p>he got super pretty a few months into the game its probably why but also zeroses(intl) arent rlly focused on the whole visual thing since there isnt an official position and jrksejdfgbiuhrehjghfjdjfdk that surprised me
