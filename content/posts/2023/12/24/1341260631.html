      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>Hanbin has choreographed for his own students when he worked as a dance teacher but heâ€™s definitely not choreographed anything for zb1 ( although he did say in an interview he would like to in the future) wakeone just need to work with better choreographers because Iâ€™m pretty sure in bloom and crush weâ€™re done by the same ones</p>

      <p>The choreo could be better but it's not the choreo, their dancing is just super unpolished and unsynchronized no matter what the choreo is, as if they learn 30 minutes before going on stage with nobody coaching them,, they need that hybe performance director</p>

      <p>i honestly donâ€™t think theyâ€™re THAT unsynchronized but the difference in execution comes from how wildly different their dance backgrounds are: hanbin mainly specialized in waacking and tutting which makes his dance style very precise and angled even when heâ€™s not doing those styles, matthew trained in hiphop i believe which makes his dance style very flowy and groovy which often clashes with the idol dances he has to do because idol dance often forgoes groove, hao mostly learned gg dances before training to be an idol which lead to his feminine, elegant and detailed dance style but also mean he lacks a lot of the power needed for more masculine choreos, gunwook seemed to learn more bg dances predebut which makes him an ideal bg dancer, idk when jiwoong became a trainee but he honestly dances like a 2nd gen idol imo so maybe he became a trainee pretty early, yujin seems to have a more contemporary style but he said he never trained in dancing before the company so idk how that came about, gyuvin just trained in the standard idol way but his body type holds him back a bit ðŸ˜­, ricky is kinda the same but to a lesser degree, taerae obviously has little to no dance training (itâ€™s ok we all gotta start somewhere). obviously most groups trained together for a long time so they mostly adapted to dance the same way after a while but zb1 didnâ€™t have that so thatâ€™s why we see such a disparity 

and imo i actually kinda like it ðŸ˜… itâ€™s more interesting for me to watch the different ways they interpret and execute the moves than just see the samey robotic synchronization that is expected of kpop idols. like the mattbin clicklike challenge, both of them did the dance correctly but  they looked so different doing it because of their different dance backgrounds and i just found it so interesting to nitpick all the little differences.

      <p>yea theyre all very different but they tend to clash and the mixing of styles in their choreo doesnt fare well with a group that has such varying skill i feel like they need foundation work on top of suitable choreo theyre are not terribleeeeee but the improvement would be great

i think no matter what peoples color will always show even if theyre trained to dance the same so that wont be lost
