      <p>I don‚Äôt care that he took pics with kids from school because that‚Äôs the most normal thing ever but I am wondering if it‚Äôs allowed because usually they aren‚Äôt allowed to be posted on other peoples socials. ( except for things like their graduations as far as I‚Äôve seen). Because I remember one of Hanbin‚Äôs friends posting a vlog at uni post bp but pre debut and he was in a bit of it and in less than a day it got taken down. So I am worried if he‚Äôs being forced or coerced into taking pics with loads of random students</p>

      <p>usually idols cant even take pics with fans they meet when theyre out but seeing as no manager was present and ppl probably insisted he took the pics 
hanbins video was taken down cuz he let his image drop right like he was acting diff and im p sure its cuz he was with a bunch of girls
