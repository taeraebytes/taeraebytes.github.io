      <p>if yujin improved his stage presence and wasnt so shy he would be running for next it boy and most popular member in korea and not 3rd place, he has so much potential but he barely speaks .. whatever he's in his 2013 jungkook era JUST WAIT TILL I GLOW UP oh nanana</p>

      <p>I find the chances now slim, not because heâ€™s not got the potential but because they are already 6 months into debut and while he is liked but Koreans itâ€™s not at the same level as the top member in domestic popularity by a long shot and international fans are weird about him simply because heâ€™s a minor. I would argue he might have his it boy boom once he hits 18ish like wonyoung did but she also has and insanee amount of domestic popularity already backing her and it was just the international side she took over with her redebut with Ive. Yujin biggest obstacle at that point (18) will be yuehua wasting him away in their dungeon because they have has so many idols that could have been the next big thing in kpop but they simply donâ€™t have the management nor connections to make it work.</p>
