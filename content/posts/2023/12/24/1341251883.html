      <p>one of the reasons taerae fell off my list is because he spent 2 whole months talking about gunwooks body he was srsly irking yes hes a beggar gunwook isnt even close with him so why would he.. maybe they tried when the gunrae boom started but the effort died in june. taerae also cried about matthew within the first month of knowing him id call that a1 beggary. gunwook moved onto matthew because matthew came first he never begs thank u
