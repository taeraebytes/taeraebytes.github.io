      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>probably why mama was the most put together but they don't have a dance teacher? I swear I've heard them talk ab one I wouldnt be surprised if they just had commissioned choreographers and that's it

      <p>its common for non-big4 idols to not have dance teacher esp zb1 since they never practiced under wakeone , i predict they learn choreo with whoever drafts their choreo and theyre on their own afterwards. I also stan ive and they said they havent had a single dance lesson since debut and yujin leads if they are practicing. except for special stage like mama i guess its like that for zb1 it would be great if they had a performance director/allocated dance teacher, its actually the reason why izone had amazing synchronisation, hyewon the worst dancer said she owed so much to them</p>
