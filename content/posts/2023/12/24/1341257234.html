      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>Hanbin has choreographed for his own students when he worked as a dance teacher but he’s definitely not choreographed anything for zb1 ( although he did say in an interview he would like to in the future) wakeone just need to work with better choreographers because I’m pretty sure in bloom and crush we’re done by the same ones</p>

      <p>The choreo could be better but it's not the choreo, their dancing is just super unpolished and unsynchronized no matter what the choreo is, as if they learn 30 minutes before going on stage with nobody coaching them,, they need that hybe performance director</p>

      <p>it partly is the choreo. they're not doing anything with their lower body it looks like they're just taking a bunch of random steps and then waving their arms around a shit ton. yeah they look unpolished and unsynchronized which makes it worse but even if you compared hanbin doing the choreo to like shotaro doing a riize choreo, it would look like shit even tho shotaro and hanbin are at a similar skill level. but also riize has black choreographers so theyre kinda taking it</p>
