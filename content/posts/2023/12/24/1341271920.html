      <p>yass u should stan riize they post a lot on ig and most of the times the members upload and post everything themselves (u can usually tell when a staff does it) and theyre also pretty active on tiktok and they do like actual trends and they have a cb in less than 2 weeks. they also update on weverse every now and then and they also upload content similar to zbtv i think weekly and also a documentary type series that shows a lot of bts like practicing and also whenever they go overseas (except we're boycotting everything from the past month cuz they edited seunghan out). i switched over a few months ago bc crush disappointed me sm and zb1 was starting to give me an ick a little and i havent looked back i still like a few members but i stopped updating myself on group activities and whatever i just use this cc to see if anything interesting happens. but i love ot7 riize and they all have such good chemistry and they're all really talented so if you're looking for a change i would recommend</p>
