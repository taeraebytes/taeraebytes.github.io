      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>Hanbin has choreographed for his own students when he worked as a dance teacher but heâ€™s definitely not choreographed anything for zb1 ( although he did say in an interview he would like to in the future) wakeone just need to work with better choreographers because Iâ€™m pretty sure in bloom and crush weâ€™re done by the same ones</p>

      <p>The choreo could be better but it's not the choreo, their dancing is just super unpolished and unsynchronized no matter what the choreo is, as if they learn 30 minutes before going on stage with nobody coaching them,, they need that hybe performance director</p>

      <p>it partly is the choreo. they're not doing anything with their lower body it looks like they're just taking a bunch of random steps and then waving their arms around a shit ton. yeah they look unpolished and unsynchronized which makes it worse but even if you compared hanbin doing the choreo to like shotaro doing a riize choreo, it would look like shit even tho shotaro and hanbin are at a similar skill level. but also riize has black choreographers so theyre kinda taking it</p>

      <p>if they wanna do a lot of arm movements (which honestly i love those kinds of choreos) they have to do it like ggs (especially izone) who make pretty shapes and textures with. their hands to give it that elegant look. the problem with what zb1 does is that they just move their hands wherever instead of making purposeful shapes. moving just to the beat is fine but it looks better when youâ€™re using more of your whole body like most bgs but zb1â€™s choreo tries to mix gg and bg choreo and doesnâ€™t do well at either. thatâ€™s why take my hand is their best imo like especially at the bridge the shapes they make with their arms is so cool</p>

      <p>im not too knowledgable ab dance but i can see what u mean the mixing of styles isnt doing good seeing as they commissioned a diff choreographer for each title i hope they go a different route again

      <p>this is why they should let Hanbin intervene and help with the choreo since he's the most knowledgeable when it comes to hand movements they got a freaking tutting/waacking pro dancer in the team ffs utilize that skill lmfao</p>

      <p>I feel like some of them wants to show their individuality and doesn't really listen to Hanbin. Hanbin is good at leading the dance performance but what if some of them doesn't want to follow. The aaa dance break was great if we only look at hanbin. The others should be humbled and start working on their dancing.</p>
