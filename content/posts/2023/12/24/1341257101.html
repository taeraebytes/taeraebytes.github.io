      <p>i rly liked hanbins intro dance in mama so much but that was the highlight and then everything else was meh. tmh is their best song but i hate their choreography this cb, its very hands/arms focused but not in a good way, like if it was tutting i get but  its not even that, they're just like waving their arms around and trying to look sexy. 

their mma and aaa performances were just weak in general and the remixes sound so bad the arrangers didnt even try and there was nothing spectacular or memorable. award shows are supposed to hype and unique but other than the dance breaks and the slightly changed instrumental, it felt like a music show. maybe im being overly critical bc theyre still rookies, but the other rookies performances were a lot more enjoyable to me

my fav mama performances were probably the surprise group performances both day 1 and 2 (endless rain from day 1 w txt, anton, and yujin and the piano guy i forgot and the sexy goddess performance from day 2 w the 4th gen mothers) and le sserafims stage

for the mmas, kiss of life, riize, and shinee all took it by a long shot which is crazy considering 2 of them havent even been debuted for 6 months.</p>

      <p>I feel like their issue isn't even the mixing anymore it's how they set these performances up I mean yea mixing is like 60% of the issue but also the concept is underutilized and they just throw crush into there like blending their two tts is difficult but man they can do better than that. ngl nobody was trying at aaa it can be shit for all I care but they need to just plan better I like the stages I feel like I can see what they were going for the but execution needs to be better I wish they weren't in a mid size lame ass company

      <p>Unpopular opinion but to me they're also lacking in stage presence as well like they don't have a member that stands out on stage and attracts the crowd/non fans. They don't try to change up during performances either like adding some adlibs or even just trying to hype up the crowd in general. Or at least some props. A themed performance. 

But nothing. They perform on stage.....and that's it. Maybe a dance break to spice things up but even those are just there for the sake of it being an award show performance. And that's why their performances are kinda boring for me - they don't bring anything new to the table.</p>

      <p>It rlly is so boring like I like them but there's nothing new the dance breaks can be really good and add smth but they're like awkwardly placed or just done like it's a requirement not to change up the performance. I think mama was the only decent attempt the dance breaks were nicely placed and the mixing was good it's because they added tmh

      <p>yeah and like even the other idols were stone faced watching them bc it was just...boring. this is why i dont like produce groups (i only keep up w hanbin since the group was formed) bc theyre not properly trained. zb1 is just weak as a whole in comparison to the other 5th gen groups bc there are very few members who would've actually been ready to debut and their concept is so ass. i mean bonedo is probably less talented but their performances and concepts were so fun and but sometimes is gas</p>

      <p>part of that is company idols don't react to anyone else but their company mates they were getting reactions from atz kof even some dream members but they rlly have to work on their stage presence as a group 2-3 members can't carry but I think they're slowly getting better they're much much better than in bloom era but we can't be waiting around for them to get better at this pace

      <p>also out of the reactions its only really zb1 stayc (especially yoon) ateez kol treasure that give good reactions basically the nonbig4 (treasure dont have hoobaes) , the sm jyp hybe idols wont crack a smile if you arent from their company, exception maybe karina and winter who are sweet to other ggs. ive too they love posing for fans throughout performances which isnt a issue to me but i saw so many zeroses mad they werent paying attention to crush i cant really blame them</p>
