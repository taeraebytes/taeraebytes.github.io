      <p>I meant like popular and a visual hes definitely not that because he's the least popular visual member so the demand for him is lower

      <p>Visually majority of the fandom prefer Hanbin hao ricky and Yujin? And outside the fandom people are always gagged by c-line visuals I think (based on their tweets that go really really viral);</p>

      <p>He's very handsome to me and it's why he's so popular he's considered A visual but he's not an official one or a stereotypical one

      <p>I think now he is? Cause last time they called jw visual it was during the bst of back to Zerose filming (in bloom era); I think visual like now is hao Yujin ? They also hao fits k beauty standards the most maybe after gyuvin? But at the same time it’s like companies ain’t pushing dozen visuals anymore so ig Gyuvin will never be pushed as a visual</p>

      <p>i think hao looks very chinese and its why a lot of people liked him ngl yes people can b very sinophobic but also a lot of kpop fans like chinese men more i mean zb1 doesnt have a single official position besides leader and its rlly all about preference and good styling they have on average good looking members so

      <p>Well I don’t think there has been any official visual line in zb1 I only remember members praising each other for their visuals and Hao called himself visual but it was more in a joking manner. 
But I do think Jiwoong and Ricky are the most praised for their visuals, jiwoong in Korean fans and Ricky among global fans.
Still there is no visual position and I think zb1 is a group with no bad visuals, even their average members could be visuals in other groups lmao</p>
