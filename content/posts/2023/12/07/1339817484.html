    "question": "Might be an unpopular opinion but post zb1 I really donâ€™t want gw back in jellyfish and would rather have him redebut with one of the more popular members. If zb1 continues to stay popular and successful I think big companies will try and buy out contracts to create bive or besserafim 2.0. My objective opinion is that hanbin and hao ( should the group stay successful) Will definitely get offers from big companies, also Yujin too. However with Yujin heâ€™s already opened up about being scouted by big companies like am and turning them down for yh so I donâ€™t know if they will reach out again or if heâ€™s just loyal and will stay with yh. Hao is also an anomaly for me because I have no doubt he will get offeres but I think duhua will genuinely offer the world to get him to stay at her company. Hanbin I think will easily go, Ravi has been sentenced with a 2 year probation meaning he will start serving right at the end of zb1 contract so tbh itâ€™s an easy option for him to move and I think big companies will want him as well especially for the domestic popularity. My hope is that Gunwook is offered something with any of them too ( not in yh tho ðŸ˜­) because jellyfish is truly ass and I canâ€™t have him go to waste in nugudan",
    "reply": "2 of gunwooks trainees friends already left jellyfish I don't think he'll stay with them idk what the future holds I hope he debuts w at least one zb1 member and hao is just too obsessed w kpop it's his dream to be an idol I think he'll promote in China but he'd try to redebut and maybe it'll work out hanbin I don't think will redebut in a group"
