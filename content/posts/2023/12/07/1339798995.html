      <p>Iâ€™m sorry if this is kinda malicious but I always laugh when I see Ricky stand next to TaeraeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Theyre just polar opposites and i hate to use the term but he mugs him so badly,</p>

      <p>Ricky just need to let the filler dissolve and stop doing it you can tell heâ€™s self conscious, Taerae botched 2, after he gained weight during camp zb1 wk1 gave him fillers and some other stuff..his bruising got bad thatâ€™s why his makeup was so cakey for a long period too much powder</p>

      <p>I always wondered ab his nose it's kind of unconventional so I never though he did anything except an implant to raise it and give a higher nose bridge
