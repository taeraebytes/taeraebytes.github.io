      <p>they kind of are if you consider who has more fans riize doesn't have a strong core fandom they have the highest charting bg song but with talk saxy flopping and the scandals and removing a member ehhhhhh they're still big tho zb1 lost a lot but they still have more fans as of rn

      <p>i think riize and zb1 are kinda equal rn with zb1 having the bigger fanbase but riize having more gp recognition but i feel like riize is going to grow bigger than zb1 soon. saying this as a zerose. their mama stages got more attention than zb1 despite zb1 having more budget (and being more interesting imo ðŸ˜ª)</p>

      <p>but anon the gp recognition is from all their scandals and controversies. If I was nosey I'd too want to tune it to their very first stage at 6. But ngl some controversies will help us so who we sacrificing? ðŸ‘¿</p>

      <p>Haoâ€™s more likely to have a bf exposed and hanbin is attending uni for kpop and doesnâ€™t have a single past dating rumor except that 1 person who knew him that said heâ€™s never dated before. Thereâ€™s no way this man basically reinvented himself to let it all go to waste over smth as stupid as a dating rumor ( plus I donâ€™t this heâ€™s straight either ) ðŸ˜‚</p>
