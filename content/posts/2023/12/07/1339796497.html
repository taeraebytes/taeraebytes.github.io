      <p>yup but something probably happened on the kside, there hasn't really been any hate post of zb1 on pann aside from the mama after party one but a lot of ppl called bs anyways. Like if they were literally so desperate they turned off their ig live to go there to 'hunt' why tf would they post pictures on social media ðŸ˜­

but either posted by hanbin akgaes or riize fans or chinese hating ppl (saw a comment that said "i hate chinese ppl" with upvotes ðŸ’€) is my only conclusion</p>

      <p>you do know that there are people that hate idols for the smallest reasons? its probably not from a hanbin akgae, pann is filled with people that have too much time on their hands</p>

      <p>Yeah even though I donâ€™t like them I doubt itâ€™s kid akgaes because post bp pann was filled with lots of trending post of homophobia and body shaming him so they tend to avoid that site all together unless a non-fan makes a positive post about him and it goes viral</p>
