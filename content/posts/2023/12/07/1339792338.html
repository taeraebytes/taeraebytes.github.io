      <p>im suprised hanbin hasnt made any idol friends (that we know of) despite being an MC. Like hao has already become close friends with Chenle, Jun and prob other c-line idols. And matthew has Canada line</p>

      <p>Hmm he probably has he seems like the type of person to keep it private tho. Even his professional dancer/ other famous friends we never found out about any of his friends through him it was always the other person who would post smth about him</p>

      <p>And if we look at his predebut videos he mostly used to hangout with female friends. I think heâ€™s the type to have more female friends than male friends so he might have already befriended some female idol friends but of course we will never get to know who those are</p>
