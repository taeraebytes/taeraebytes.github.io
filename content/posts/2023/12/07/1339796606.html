      <p>it's bcs tmh is too fast and too high to be sung by one person..but yeh he shouldve chosen songs that suit his tone or at least they shouldve rearranged the song idk</p>

      <p>his tone doesn't match the song and he has a limited range as a singer but I think he had to choose a song from the mini or smth

      <p>I don't even think it's his tone, he just sounds strained no matter what song he signs no hate just something I noticed and don't like about his singing.</p>

      <p>Is it true survival group never have a vocal leason like it's already 2nd comeback but i don't see the improve with some members like yujin gyuvin jiwoong and matthew, even hanbin is still mediocre, ngl i think they will give hanbin some leasons since he got highnotes the most since he's not hao and taerae level</p>
