      <p>i think riize and zb1 are kinda equal rn with zb1 having the bigger fanbase but riize having more gp recognition but i feel like riize is going to grow bigger than zb1 soon. saying this as a zerose. their mama stages got more attention than zb1 despite zb1 having more budget (and being more interesting imo ðŸ˜ª)</p>

      <p>but anon the gp recognition is from all their scandals and controversies. If I was nosey I'd too want to tune it to their very first stage at 6. But ngl some controversies will help us so who we sacrificing? ðŸ‘¿</p>

      <p>There's been some micro scandal and tea but zeroses hide it bcs for ex they don't like Jiwoong but his rumors might affect their big3 (Hanbin Hao Yujin) and since it's only 2 years they're keeping it lowk but idk if it'll last bcs there's a lot of frustration</p>
