    "reply": "I don't think they're gonna push for the Japanese market they're having a Korean cb almost immediately after and they only have 2 years so it doesn't matter cuz it will always be too early I just hope they wrap this up fast and go back to laser focusing on korea they're probably only gonna have an Asia tour too afterwards everyone needs to stop saying world tour"
