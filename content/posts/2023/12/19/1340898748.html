      <p>This is actually insane when you consider this is the first time he’s ever mentioned hanbin on bubble, reminds me of when one of his cfans basically shouted at him to not be near hanbin at a fansign but rosins tried to play it off like the person didn’t say that even though multiple people heard it. Like I don’t realise his fans hated hanbin to that extent …</p>
