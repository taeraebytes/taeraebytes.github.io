      <p>She probably is I remember his Chinese fans were calling out c shippers because they went to her cafe with weirdly worded haobin signs knowing she canâ€™t read a damn work is Chinese and took photos with her and the signs and plastered them all over wb. She liked so many videos and pictures of all the boys I highly doubt sheâ€™s sitting there and reading through all the comments but shippers like to ignore the fact she likes alot of other members post too</p>
