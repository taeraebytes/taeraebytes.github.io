 iâ€™m sorry but this is peak ricky autism like gyuvin making ricky say a random phrase and ricky just cluelessly goes along with it and without reading the room he suddenly says an old fashioned slang with no context gagging the others and gyuwook laughing at himâ€¦ obsessed with his perpetual cluelessness he must have a thick head</p>
