      <p>itâ€™s crazy cuz if u see his nose predebut it looked sm better. like it was already the ideal nose, it was tall, narrow, and very angular and suited his face so well so the implant was unnecessary</p>

      <p>heâ€™s a good singer, is trained in producing (thatâ€™s what he had been planning on pursuing in uni), and he brought a lot of intl count/attention to the group bc of tiktok. yeah heâ€™s a nepo baby but heâ€™s not useless like eunseok is right there</p>
