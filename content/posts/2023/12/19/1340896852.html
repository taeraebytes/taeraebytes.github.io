      <p>This is actually insane when you consider this is the first time heâ€™s ever mentioned hanbin on bubble, reminds me of when one of his cfans basically shouted at him to not be near hanbin at a fansign but rosins tried to play it off like the person didnâ€™t say that even though multiple people heard it. Like I donâ€™t realise his fans hated hanbin to that extent â€¦</p>
