      <p>decided to look through yujin's tweets and bbls to see who he posts most
yujin: 1st person posted was jiwoong jun 29, 2nd was gyuvin on jul 22 on a post that also had jiwoong
jiwoong: 4
gyuvin: 4
hanbin: 5
hao: 1
matthew: 1
really didn't expect hanbin to win that

and here's gunwook
gunwook: first person posted was ricky jul 13, 2nd was jiwoong,
ricky: 1
jiwoong: 1
taerae: 1
hanbin & hao: 1? couldn't really tell who was in this photo you couldn't see one of their faces
matthew: 2
gyuvin: 1
photo that was taken by junhyeon yes im counting this: 1

i noticed that in both cases they posted only one duo pic on bbl and it was a pic with gyuvin</p>
