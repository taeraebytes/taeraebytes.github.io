      <p>saw in another cc that the other rumour is that this was like exposed on some korean forum (maybe with a photo? something was said about it being mentioned in his university's group chat) and then deleted after 15 mins. they were saying it was either a dancer, some guy from his university or both but i haven't really seen any proof for any of this</p>
