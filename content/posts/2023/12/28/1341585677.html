      <p>you're either mentally ill or just straight up blind if you think wakeone gives a single shit about hao if it wasn't for his fans standing up for him their response to rosins complaints abt not postponing the fansigns and making hao sign 400 albums right after his quarantine ended being recording a half assed 8 episode solo show IN A DAY also right after his quarantine ended only available on weibo like they didn't even try to hide the fact that that shit was catered towards c-fans... and this is just once instance don't EVER compare the way they treat hanbin/jiwoong/yujin to any other member and especially c-line lmfao.</p>
