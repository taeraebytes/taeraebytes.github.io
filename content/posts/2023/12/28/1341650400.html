      <p>Controversial opinion but Iâ€™m actually convinced Matthew was p01 over hao, only because during those final weeks of boys planet and the pd pick allegations seokryus were fighting for their life to vote and defend him and his big drop in the 3rd eliminations put him most at risk to them to fall out of the top 9, till that point no one else (from the top 9) really had as big of a worry as them like hanbin was p01 for all eliminations atp and hao p02 for the last 2 eliminations. My guess is they showed the interim ranks because they couldnâ€™t have Matthew p01 with the pd pick allegations still going on so they would rather have it be one of the other two.</p>
