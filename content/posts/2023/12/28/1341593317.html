      <p>the show definitely didn’t like them equally but they were obsessed with them as a duo 😭 i mean they obv wanted hanbin to win to the point they revealed he was third on interim ranking, but yeah hao is not 8/9 i think being the center and his fandom having big buying power helps him in comparison to ricky</p>

      <p>Ok maybe yea they def didn't want hao winning first that's for sure but hao is treated like a center more and more and I think it's great his fandom and popularity is helping him wakeone is just a terrible company but he's doing all right definitely not even close to the bottom

      <p>And also rosins would lose their mind if they treated him like Ricky. Even him missing that fansign made them go ballistic and send 4 trucks right in front of the fansign building</p>

      <p>okay but riyangis shouldve lashed out harder and got some trucks as soon as the manager thing happened, wakeone does respond when they fuck up  but if u clog their emails and do hashtags the most they'll do is give him a extra tiktok . i think everyone from akgaes or ot9 wouldnt have a issue but sadly global ricky thinks its enough to do some twitter poll</p>
