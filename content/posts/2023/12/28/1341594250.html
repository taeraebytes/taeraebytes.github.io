      <p>true but most idols get into companies and groups bc of money and connections even if theyâ€™re lowkey abt it. antonâ€™s talented and was surrounded by music from a young age: he plays 3 instruments, heâ€™s been composing since he was 12, he participated in their debut song and also helped compose for a movie that recently came out, and he was going to go to nyu to get a degree in music and producing. it doesnâ€™t erase the nepotism but itâ€™s annoying when ppl dismiss everything abt him bc of it. like heâ€™s been passionate abt music and pursing a career in the music industry long before he even thought abt going to korea itâ€™s not like he randomly woke up and decided he wanted to be famous</p>

      <p>I get it but it's never going to go away at least not for now that's just how things are he's going to have to work extra hard to prove himself and detach from the title
