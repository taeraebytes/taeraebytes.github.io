      <p>I don’t know what rumors anon is talking abt but lol this reminded me when the incident first happened and the hyung line weren’t there (this was when they were at swf finale and before we knew Jiwoong didn’t live with them at the dorms so every just assume he was like sick or something) and everyone was like the manager took advantage of the fact that his group leader and hyungs weren’t there to “protect” him and like mind you Jiwoong and Hanbin have openly talked abt how much they love there staff and literally not close to Ricky</p>
