      <p>p1 and p2 before the interim was 100 percent Hao and one of the other two globals in the lineup, meaning either Matthew or Ricky cause after the interim vid the Koreans started panicking and voting the Korean trainees like crazy</p>

      <p>Idk I feel like having the reigning number 1 trainee dropped to 3 it would make anyone panic like I don't think the pds goals was to make him 2 becuase I remember in real time everyone lost it even the non fans it was def a ploy to get him to 1 and rosins voted like crazy just out of scare they wanted him in the top3 at least hanbin fans slowed down as well in live voting I feel like
