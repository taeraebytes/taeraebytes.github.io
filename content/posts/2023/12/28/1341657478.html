      <p>I got his bubble the day the profiles opened and tbh he’s never been that active, like in the first month he sent less than 20 messages. Ofc bubble ban was definitely a thing but he’s gone back to posting and nothing has happened that would make wakeone put him on another ban but I do think the ban has made some riyagis hypersensitive to it now and I feel now that people are looking at other members who send 200+ messages a month or message every single day it looks worse but he’s always been quite on bubble same with jiwoong</p>

      <p>Yea his fans are not the brightest they're demanding activity out of someone who was never on it like that and they just go crazy on everyone like this is all him.. have you considered you guys are just bad vibes?

      <p>He’s not banned anymore because he sent a message and a photo of him wearing Gunwook’s shirt but his stuff is restricted and has to be approved  by managers I’m assuming so he just gave up on uploading all together</p>
