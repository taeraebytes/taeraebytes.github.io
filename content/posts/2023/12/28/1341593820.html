      <p>This fandom is just terrorism every single day I wanna kms oh my god I have never seen such miserable freaks ever in my whole years of being a kpop fan I know it's the consequences of being a survival show group but the competitive mindset MUST get tiring at some point like give it a fucking rest.</p>

      <p>Tbh they're not the worst this is probably ur first time being deeply involved I've seen worse over the years ðŸ˜­ the competitiveness and akgae culture from the show is the only thing setting it apart but yea every fandom gets nasty and crazy like this they remind me of 3rd gen fandoms
