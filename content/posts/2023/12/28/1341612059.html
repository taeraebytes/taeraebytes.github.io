      <p>the show definitely didnâ€™t like them equally but they were obsessed with them as a duo ðŸ˜­ i mean they obv wanted hanbin to win to the point they revealed he was third on interim ranking, but yeah hao is not 8/9 i think being the center and his fandom having big buying power helps him in comparison to ricky</p>

      <p>Ok maybe yea they def didn't want hao winning first that's for sure but hao is treated like a center more and more and I think it's great his fandom and popularity is helping him wakeone is just a terrible company but he's doing all right definitely not even close to the bottom

      <p>And also rosins would lose their mind if they treated him like Ricky. Even him missing that fansign made them go ballistic and send 4 trucks right in front of the fansign building</p>

      <p>okay but riyangis shouldve lashed out harder and got some trucks as soon as the manager thing happened, wakeone does respond when they fuck up  but if u clog their emails and do hashtags the most they'll do is give him a extra tiktok . i think everyone from akgaes or ot9 wouldnt have a issue but sadly global ricky thinks its enough to do some twitter poll</p>

      <p>They should have dealt with this the way Rosins did. I feel like all they actually did was trend #rickyiszb1 on Twitter and call it a day</p>

      <p>I cant speak for all of them but the ones I see just trend hashtags or get insufferable I'm not sure what the k and c fans are up to but it's more emails and callout posts. Theyre definitely not at a size to boycott cu that's not gonna do none but trucks is an option ig idk

      <p>What did Rosins do besides sending trucks? /gen 

All I remember before crush era was that international rosins basically did the same thing when they didn't cancel the fancall or when they didn't let Hao sing Always at fancon, they trended hash tags and emailed wakeone but they also threatened to not support the group/ crush and only buy hao solo stuff, like if there's a magazine only buy his cover etc.

But honestly if you're living across the sea what can you really do besides send trucks, emails and hashtags.</p>

      <p>Ok you have to consider the general power of the fandoms rosins and riyangis aren't comparable at all. and rosins really do make a difference in sales and streams so even if both fandoms do similar things one will be taken more seriously. 

Yea that's all u can do if ur American or smth
