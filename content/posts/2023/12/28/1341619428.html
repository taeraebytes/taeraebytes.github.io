      <p>anon u  havent watched it but its boring uhh okay even for someone who just enjoys their content from tiktok thats hypocritical but campzb1 was fun and the vlogs arent supposed to entertain u its just what a bunch of men are doing when travelling to and from overseas schedule</p>

      <p>I've heard good things ab zbtv even tho the acting concept is just stagnant but I just cant be assed to watch. they could be good with a proper show they're not a boring group but the zepisodes.. snooze vlogs that's only if you're into that so snooze the folders first two episodes were sooo fun tho and camp zb1 was great. I think they're attempting to take constructive criticism for zbtv so maybe things won't be bad
