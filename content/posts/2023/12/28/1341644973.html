      <p>They probably didn't expect anyone to ever overtake them and slowed down

      <p>Controversial opinion but I‚Äôm actually convinced Matthew was p01 over hao, only because during those final weeks of boys planet and the pd pick allegations seokryus were fighting for their life to vote and defend him and his big drop in the 3rd eliminations put him most at risk to them to fall out of the top 9, till that point no one else (from the top 9) really had as big of a worry as them like hanbin was p01 for all eliminations atp and hao p02 for the last 2 eliminations. My guess is they showed the interim ranks because they couldn‚Äôt have Matthew p01 with the pd pick allegations still going on so they would rather have it be one of the other two.</p>

      <p>that does not make sense for many reasons also mnet did not want Hao in p01 just as much as they did not want Matthew in p01</p>

      <p>Yeah that‚Äôs why the interim released and if you read the reply you would see I said they would RATHER have hao or hanbin as p01 than Matt. I‚Äôm not saying they wanted hao p01 but if Matt p01 hao p02 and hanbin p03 and there is already massive pd pick allegations going on that literally ended groups like X1 then I‚Äôd rather risk having hao as p01 than Matthew</p>

      <p>I mean it would probably not be difficult to debunk the rigging allegations if it got that serious and it came to that because wasn‚Äôt there another company entirely overseeing the whole process?</p>

      <p>Rigging and being a pd pick are two completely different prospects. There was no rigging but when Matthew got 16 minutes of screentime in the creation mission and a whole redemption arc storyline that none of the other g trainees got people start to question</p>
