      <p>They probably didn't expect anyone to ever overtake them and slowed down

      <p>Controversial opinion but Iâ€™m actually convinced Matthew was p01 over hao, only because during those final weeks of boys planet and the pd pick allegations seokryus were fighting for their life to vote and defend him and his big drop in the 3rd eliminations put him most at risk to them to fall out of the top 9, till that point no one else (from the top 9) really had as big of a worry as them like hanbin was p01 for all eliminations atp and hao p02 for the last 2 eliminations. My guess is they showed the interim ranks because they couldnâ€™t have Matthew p01 with the pd pick allegations still going on so they would rather have it be one of the other two.</p>

      <p>hao had 2m votes and matthew had 1.7m, so i really doubt he was above hao at any point, and iâ€™m very sure they just wanted hanbin specifically to win, even though hao was their token ch trainee he still was chinese and they either evil edited or hid all others, they definitely didnâ€™t want him to win over the main korean pick</p>

      <p>I feel like being P02 actually helped Hanbin. Sometimes i wonder if ravi's case in any way impacted his vote, but since he was second, people were more sympathetic to him. i also don't think mnet actually wanted him to be the centre at the end for this reason.</p>
