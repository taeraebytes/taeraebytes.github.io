      <p>Well no cause Jiwoongs fans are all insane I remember beside allindan and rosins , they were the first to be saying they're solo stans and that jiwoong deserves better yadayada, some of them still hate taerae cause his fans were mad jiwoong was in say my name instead of taerae and put pies on his face, yes I saw this on the tl during MMA 😭😂</p>

      <p>Well yes his fans are schizophrenic they're funny tho nfjfjnfndjkfkdke but they don't pack a punch ngl they got me suspended in April but I would be more scared of seokryus. I can't lie his fans are so funny I made a joke about him affording a Seoul apartment and they were rlly on my ass but I couldn't even b mad they got jokes
