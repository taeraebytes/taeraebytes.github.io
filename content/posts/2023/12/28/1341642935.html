      <p>Hao matthrw gunwook are the top when it comes to popularity there even if the other members fandoms grow they still won't be number one for this era ik hanbins popular too but it would take so so much for him to be. If wakeones smart theyd push those 3 for maximum affect

      <p>yeah those 3 are the ones with a bigger fandom. the thing with hanbin is that he's just really liked among the fandom, he barely has haters over there. the jfans say things about how his personality feels sincere and responsable so they feel like they can trust him and stan zb1 without fear (?) idk if that makes sense, but basically in japan leadership is really important and also the fans find him really cute bc of his way of speaking japanese.</p>
