      <p>just saw this from an allin cc 

"Requeefiem doesn't want to reply to my cc but she started shit first by telling how it is always Hanbin who is favored by that flop company, said how Hanbin is not relevant internationally and now she is acting all normal about all this. Bitch should go back to the trash where she belongs and stop speaking about Hanbin. Starting shit and then pretending to be all innocent. Hanbin stans aren't as loud and whiny as they want to be but not me though. I need that bitch and the people in her cc gone"

      <p>I think I know who's cc thats from and they a bunch of btches. They talk and talk and talk about Hanbin being the most experienced dancer therefore he should always be the center in their dance breaks, how Gunwook over dances and Yujin lacks the omf and how they have no choice but to share the dance break center with Hao cause then his Chinese fans will send hate trucks to Hanbin again. They always talking bout his past wacking experience and always mentioning bada for validation but they'll never post or rt Hanbins old dancing videos.</p>

      <p>he's a great dancer but he's not that far ahead in idol dancing specifically he's been training in it just as long as some of the members he just happens to have previous dancing experience that sets him apart, Longshot is a stretch. the delusion begins with the god complex that his fans have that make it impossible for anyone to even come close to him in their eyes there's great dance members in the group and it's just unfair for them to get bashed when they're just as good with the choreos

      <p>but the genres they are doing for the dancebreaks it's not even idol dancing choreos. and if it was gunwook or Yujin getting the dancebreaks too i would support but getting Ricky, gyuvin, Jiwoong and hao dancebreaks when they are not even dance line ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I mean dancebreaks are closer to idol dancing than hbs background but I agree the dancebreaks being led by non dance members is jarring but what can u do and hao is just the center
