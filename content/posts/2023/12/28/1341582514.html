      <p>O wow I'm reading about the parasite actor $uicide on a kforum, at first I thought the whole scandal was because he did drugs and reporters wrote fake articles about him going to brothels but turns out he just smoked some weed and took sleeping pills so I was confused why he went to that extent but apparently the brothel was true and there's a leaked an audio of clip of him doing it.

"It's shameful that the transcript was exposed... It wasn't just an article saying he went to a brothel, engaged in prostitution, or had an affair, but an audio clip of him having sex with a prostitute and confessing to her that he liked her was on the news."

damn.. they broadcasted it on the news for the entire nation to see and hear. wtf</p>

      <p>Oh this is so shocking I saw a bunch of articles when the drug allegations first dropped I actually had no clue he took his life till nowðŸ˜§ it's very irresponsible to release all that evidence to the public and broadcast it on national television... what did they think he was going to do this is worse than just serving silently his life was ruined I don't support it but it didn't have to go this far [EDIT] so I read up more on the situation he was involved in trafficking and the brothels he visited almost always were full of young almost minor girls so erm I take it back this. I initially said that I didn't support his actions but it didn't have to go this far but he seemed to have been running from what he did I don't feel sympathy anymore tbh

because all the speculations about drugs and brothels were put out by the media, they're still mid investigation so why would they leak all these sensitive info especially the audio. It's because the government + media wants to divert the attention to him by all means because they couldn't pin it on GD. Also if you read up about the brothels I think it could be true there's minors (again put out by the media) but he was only in contact with one person, supposedly the owner or co owner which was in the leaked audio. 

I think this changes a lot of things

I think this is way more than oh he went to a brothel with minors and smoked some weed, got leaked and couldn't handle the embarrassment/ shame. I mean the SK President has a fckin shaman making the decisions for him... like c'mon and I'm not joking, everyone knows this if you follow sk politics and you can see the shaman next to him pictures.</p>

      <p>Hmmm the First Lady? I dont follow korean news and politics like that but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case. This is a difficult issue since I don't support what he was doing at all but it was a deliberate leak and idk if anything was fabricated. Definitely I do feel less sympathy still because I'm just so against prostitution of young girls idgaf ab drugs but yea.. I guess we will just have to see how it unfolds I feel for his wife and children though

      <p>o damn... o right this reminds me cuz wasnt the reason why they suddenly leaked Jisoo and that actor dating because the government tried to coverup that teachers sui cide? iirc i think it was a prestige skool for wealthy families and when the teacher i think for gr 2 or something told the parents about their childs bad behavior instead of correcting their child they bullied the teacher instead, harassing her, sending her death threats on kakao or something to the point she commited sui cide in her classroom and the students found her the next day. i rmb seeing it on pann and a bunch of teachers went on strike cuz no media was talking about it and suddenly only talked bout Jisoo.

and apparently jisoo and that actor just went on one date and it got leaked for a coverup</p>
