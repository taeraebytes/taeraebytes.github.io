 are they stupid? Riyangis bring 0 money what do they think boycotting will do? Wk1 wonâ€™t even feel the boycot. They donâ€™t stream on Korean platforms, they donâ€™t stream on Spotify, they donâ€™t even contribute to YouTube streams (seeing ricky fancams views). The group is doing fine on sns without ricky he is not even the most searched member worldwide ig.</p>
