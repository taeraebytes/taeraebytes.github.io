      <p>i rly liked hanbins intro dance in mama so much but that was the highlight and then everything else was meh. tmh is their best song but i hate their choreography this cb, its very hands/arms focused but not in a good way, like if it was tutting i get but  its not even that, they're just like waving their arms around and trying to look sexy. 

their mma and aaa performances were just weak in general and the remixes sound so bad the arrangers didnt even try and there was nothing spectacular or memorable. award shows are supposed to hype and unique but other than the dance breaks and the slightly changed instrumental, it felt like a music show. maybe im being overly critical bc theyre still rookies, but the other rookies performances were a lot more enjoyable to me

my fav mama performances were probably the surprise group performances both day 1 and 2 (endless rain from day 1 w txt, anton, and yujin and the piano guy i forgot and the sexy goddess performance from day 2 w the 4th gen mothers) and le sserafims stage

for the mmas, kiss of life, riize, and shinee all took it by a long shot which is crazy considering 2 of them havent even been debuted for 6 months.</p>
