      <p>you'll get jumped here too but bbl is more independent I don't think anyone controls how much he posts but damn maybe there's a video out there saying he can't post there eitherðŸ˜…

      <p>well not a riyangi or a kepler stan so i might be wrong but i think ricky didnâ€™t post on bubble for a whole month after that incident where the manager yelled at him for going on live without asking him (which by itself means that they control how much they appear on bubble) and i think iâ€™ve heard something about xiaoting saying she had a set amount of times she could post on there in a month or smth, but i am not sure about this part</p>

      <p>he did say that he wasn't allowed to go live before then right? Or that he had to get permission smth like that I don't see how putting him on a ban after the uproar of that live would make sense but here we are
