      <p>you'll get jumped here too but bbl is more independent I don't think anyone controls how much he posts but damn maybe there's a video out there saying he can't post there eitherðŸ˜…

      <p>i mean, there was definitely a time when he seemed like after that incident where gyuvin and gunwook were on live and u could hear ricky being scolded in the background he wasn't active on bubble at all for nearly an exact month which is the amount of time an idol can be inactive on there before having some sort of punishment? i think it's like receiving less of the income that comes through that app idk cmiiw, so i do think he was for sure banned then bc he came back literally the day before it would've been a month of inactivity though the other times he wasn't that active either so idk</p>

      <p>He isn't too active but a month was crazy I don't think jiwoong even went without it for that long and he would usually post food pics all the time so if it was a ban

      <p>As itâ€™s a monthly subscription, On bubble if an idol doesnâ€™t send anything for a month then everyone gets refunded for that month meaning the idol doesnâ€™t make any money.</p>
