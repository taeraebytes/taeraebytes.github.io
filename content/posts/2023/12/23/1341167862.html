      <p>watch it never made it onto melon top 100 while get a guitar is still within the top 20 or 30 (i think they peaked at #12 or #15) after almost 4 months and are currently the highest charting bg in melon. yeah tbz has a bigger fandom duh bc they've been around for longer but fandom is not enough to be relevant you need gp recognition bc thats what gets you more opportunities (as a group). also id rather have gp popularity over a massive fandom that lives in a bubble where barely anyone outside of it knows whats going on bc it means people genuinely like the music.</p>

      <p>Ok but one song that's charted well isn't a reflection of their whole career I'm just saying you guys are jumping the gun their second release tanked and tbz have multiple cbs that have charted much much better than watch it and they have longevity like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ ur making these predictions off one thing like I said just wait and see how their next cb goes and tbz aren't entirely fandom based they're pretty well known for a 4th gen bg

      <p>what longevity they lowkey peaked from late 2020 through 2021 and have slowly been going down since. whisper and lip gloss did chart better than like every 4th gen bg except for txt but it still tanked a lot from before. yeah riize's 2nd cb didnt do as well but its on them for announcing it like a week beforehand (it was a digital single not even a proper cb with promotion) and its still probably doing better than every other 5th gen bg (im not counting plave bc they literally are not real people)</p>

      <p>well their decline can solely be blamed on a company change and their century long world tour even then their cb that had 2 week notice was rushed everything was learned while on tour broke some of their own record so yea I'd call 2+ years longevity better than a rocky 3 months pleaseðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and roar did rlly well and that was 2023 riize has been out for what 3 months like plz calm down and crush did do better than talk saxy like it don't matter if it was cuz of streaming that's just how bgs operate
