      <p>Ok he is but he listens to other things he's always recommending pretty Chinese songs. But I like idols who are obsessed with their jobs it's cute

      <p>this is so stupid bc every idol had to at least go through a kpop phase to become a kpop artist ðŸ˜­ why else whould they be in such a risky industry esp in smaller agencies, and the whole group are  stans itâ€™s just hao is a kpop encyclopedia while others mostly talk about their ults</p>
