      <p>Your anons are so pessimistic. Zb1 is pretty good honestly, at least they sing live often. They just need an actual dance teacher because their choreo is always a mess. Hanbin is not teaching shit</p>

      <p>probably why mama was the most put together but they don't have a dance teacher? I swear I've heard them talk ab one I wouldnt be surprised if they just had commissioned choreographers and that's it
