      <p>Internationally yes zb1 members are known but as someone who lived in Korea from may - November the only member people outside the fandom really know is him 😭😭😭 i remember I went to a uni event in September and being excited because I mentioned zb1 and all the people I was with knew hanbin so my ass was like yeah I like XXX …… I can’t explain the shame of hearing “nugu” in real life</p>

      <p>POOR YOU😭😭😭 I think with award season they're becoming more known as a group and wakeone is attempting to get more members out there but yea they're not really anything super popular they have decent domestic fans but that's it the fifth gen is allllll losers compared to everyone else

      <p>Same anon but Yeah I think it will take a while for 5th gen to fully break through just like how itzy and txt started 4th gen but it didn’t really start booming until I’ve, lesserafim enhypen ect. Unfortunately by that point for 5th gen zb1 will have probably disbanded since we are still very much in the 4th gen high. Although I guess knowing at least 1 member of the group or having 1 that is known by the gp is better than them all being stuck in domestic nugudom. Also not many people tune into these award shows domestically 😭 like it’s mainly international fans. Mama and mma have been going downhill ever year since covid and people just aren’t as interested tbh.</p>

      <p>I watched the entire award shows this year for zb1 and I have to say they were one of the worst performers in all of it.</p>
