      <p>y'all talking about juyeon like he is Eunwoo is so funny. That man is a nobody and not even that huge in Korea. 4th gen bgs in general didn't have the impact 3rd gen bgs had. And for 5th gen it is still their beginning and there is a long way to go and they are already doing better in kcharts than 4th gen bgs. It wouldn't be long before they overtake him. Have you not seen ksites like theqoo or idol issue ig page, we can clearly see who creates more gp buzz and is most talked about from there.</p>
