      <p>y'all talking about juyeon like he is Eunwoo is so funny. That man is a nobody and not even that huge in Korea. 4th gen bgs in general didn't have the impact 3rd gen bgs had. And for 5th gen it is still their beginning and there is a long way to go and they are already doing better in kcharts than 4th gen bgs. It wouldn't be long before they overtake him. Have you not seen ksites like theqoo or idol issue ig page, we can clearly see who creates more gp buzz and is most talked about from there.</p>

      <p>younghoon is running up the actor bag and he's more of the traditional visual but juyeons brand deals just seem stronger plus younghoon pissed his fans off while he was dating but juyeon fans stuck by him now we just need hyunjae to break in

      <p>I used to pray that they kept the bits in a cooler so they could reattach but it settled nicely it's just that he lost his charm
