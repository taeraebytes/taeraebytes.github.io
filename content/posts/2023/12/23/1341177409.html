      <p>He said smth along the lines of "it's not my favorite" I think but I'm pretty sure that was after it had already came out or the teaser was released

      <p>Yeah I remember that he donâ€™t say he didnâ€™t like it he just liked the other tracks more, it was fans commenting they didnâ€™t like the teaser and he was upset because they worked hard on it</p>
