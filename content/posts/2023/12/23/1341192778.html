      <p>i rly liked hanbins intro dance in mama so much but that was the highlight and then everything else was meh. tmh is their best song but i hate their choreography this cb, its very hands/arms focused but not in a good way, like if it was tutting i get but  its not even that, they're just like waving their arms around and trying to look sexy. 

their mma and aaa performances were just weak in general and the remixes sound so bad the arrangers didnt even try and there was nothing spectacular or memorable. award shows are supposed to hype and unique but other than the dance breaks and the slightly changed instrumental, it felt like a music show. maybe im being overly critical bc theyre still rookies, but the other rookies performances were a lot more enjoyable to me

my fav mama performances were probably the surprise group performances both day 1 and 2 (endless rain from day 1 w txt, anton, and yujin and the piano guy i forgot and the sexy goddess performance from day 2 w the 4th gen mothers) and le sserafims stage

for the mmas, kiss of life, riize, and shinee all took it by a long shot which is crazy considering 2 of them havent even been debuted for 6 months.</p>

      <p>I feel like their issue isn't even the mixing anymore it's how they set these performances up I mean yea mixing is like 60% of the issue but also the concept is underutilized and they just throw crush into there like blending their two tts is difficult but man they can do better than that. ngl nobody was trying at aaa it can be shit for all I care but they need to just plan better I like the stages I feel like I can see what they were going for the but execution needs to be better I wish they weren't in a mid size lame ass company

      <p>but i mean even kiss of life comes from an even more nugu company and their performance at the mma's was insane. honestly the investment into everything about the group is amazing the mv's are so cinematic and the tracks are incredible. i think its more that the company doesn't care too much or the people they're hiring aren't good enough</p>
