    "question": "i'm sorry but i don't get why ppl call wk1 a small/mid size company (this isn't anything against u bc i realise u said something similar it's just in general about what most of the fandom says and this cc reminded me of it lmao) like is wk1 not under cj which controls a bunch of shit and has connections? that's mega $$$. either wk1 is not getting sent that money OR wk1 is using it in the wrong ways, not utilising it right. it's kind of a pet peeve of mine but at the same time i don't know much about business so maybe i'm completely wrong LMAO",
    "reply": "I would call them midsize there aren't supposed to be a lot of \"big\" companies anyways. The revenue difference is humungous not to mention the big companies have multiple subsidiaries and at least 3 active groups each so wakeone doesn't even come close. Their revenue and idol sizes are comparable to that of high up and jelly fish and yuehua like they're not anything big. Even though they are under cj enm they're just not good at management and the connection barely does shit they payola barely comes thru. I think specifically it's wakeone fucking up not cj enm it's like how creker (tbz old company) is under kakao and so was play m (victon old company) but there was a big difference between the two how they were managed what kind of training they received even the revenue they brought in. So I don't really think cj enm has as much control over wakeone but I could be wrong."
