      <p>y’all are being dramatic about hao/ricky’s relationship (really every zb1 relationship but) ricky can’t fake being close to someone for shit and if you watch zepisodes when they’re alone tgt they’re both clearly very comfortable w e/o and they live tgt so not hanging out 1 on 1 outside doesn’t mean they aren’t friends especially w how busy their schedules are</p>

      <p>Well that's what I said they only got close during the group contrary to what most ppl thought thinking they were close brothers from the very beginning in trainee days. they're comfortable w each other ofc but they're also not each others closest members
