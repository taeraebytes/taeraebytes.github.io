      <p>People just admired their chemistry but Wonyoung is shipped more with Ricky and Gyuvin, sometimes gunwook too but those two especially. Ricky and Wonyoung was thing since Bp but recently Gyuvin and Wonyoung has been having so many viral tiktoks . Hanbin has always been shipped with Karina or Winter. Also with Minju and Sullyoon a lot</p>

      <p>I dont see Wonyoung and Ricky is it cause of the prince and princess visuals? I feel like its too strong and clashes plus I saw her recently saying she doesnt like tsundere and i feel like Ricky is tsundere typeðŸ˜‚ I dont like Gyuvin and Wony either cause he just looks like a loser next to her.</p>
