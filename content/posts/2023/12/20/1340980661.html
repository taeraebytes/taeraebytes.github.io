    "question": "jaw shaving has to be one of the worst plastic surgeries ever. i mean they all are because the whole is to make a client return and pay more and more for maintenance but like once you get a jaw shave it's over. it causes very extreme skin sagging on the jaw when the aging process starts and that shit can't be saved by anything other than face lift that will push your hairline further back and lasts only 10 years so you will have to get it over and over again. plastic surgery industry is such a scam",
    "reply": "it's so scary omg cutting away at the bone like that... also typically korean jaw shaves have no type of support they will seriously have the you looking crazy with half your face gone"
