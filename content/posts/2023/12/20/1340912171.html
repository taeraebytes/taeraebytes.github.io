      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything 😌

      <p>It’s seems unfair but I think this is common with survival show mentality that everything needs to be equal. Like I’ve accepted it long ago and it’s actually bought me peace in no group are the schedules and opportunity equal like he’s there is a difference in one member getting absolutely nothing but considering they have had loads more unit and solo schedules for all the members (-Ricky) for crush promotions I’m trying not to complain because it’s about as fair as it’s going to get</p>

      <p>to be honest yeah gunwook and Ricky switched spots cuz this is what happened to him during in bloom but I guess with riyangis some of their complaining worked a bit but also you just have to understand things aren't gonna go how you want them esp with wake1 as a company
