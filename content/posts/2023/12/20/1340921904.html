      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything ðŸ˜Œ

      <p>I think its gonna be 2-3 members from each group since theyâ€™re too many.. probably for zb1 its gonna be gunwook, hanbin or taerae (wishing ricky tho we need that clout for him), riize wonbin, anton and shotaro, bnd would be taesan and jaehyun then for &team could be K and Nicholas</p>
