      <p>It doesnâ€™t surprise me heâ€™s arguably the 2nd most popular in Korea and the company already get accused of favouring the Japanese market, tbh the timing was stupid idk if they are trying to recreate a Kepler 2.0 by pushing for the Japanese market but they need to realise itâ€™s not going to work out to well this early in their career like most established group only have a foreign debut (jpn,eng ect) years into debut once they have an established fanbase</p>

      <p>I don't think they're gonna push for the Japanese market they're having a Korean cb almost immediately after and they only have 2 years so it doesn't matter cuz it will always be too early I just hope they wrap this up fast and go back to laser focusing on korea they're probably only gonna have an Asia tour too afterwards everyone needs to stop saying world tour

      <p>Yeah I think w1 makes stupid decision but JP debut after 2 songs is relatively normal esp since it's their 2nd biggest market, hopefully they can have another fan on in Korea before</p>
