      <p>I know studio glide are nugu but at least they treat hanbin well, like that glide director has gone to every single major zb1 gig to support him ( Kcon LA and Japan, AAA, mcountdown in Paris) 
They put out a whole debut photoshoot a day after the finale for him and a behinds the scene making film too. 
Put up a birthday photoshoot post for him (although wakeone did make them take that down) 
and even now they are having an end of year party and the invite card showed all of the l1ve labels sub divisions including glide and since hanbin is their only artist people are speculating he went ( which might be why gyuvin mentioned doing his makeup). This reminds me of 143 inviting yeseo and mashiro to a company dinner recently and all keplians know 143 treats those two amazing.
like gl1de may be small companies but god are they doing everything to treat hanbin good. Then I think about the others like damn you come from mid size companies how is a nugu company treating their artist better than any of you.</p>
