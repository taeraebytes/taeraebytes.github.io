      <p>no its an ex bf, the thing started with some (people who knew hanbin or the bf) uni classmates that were talking about it on a gc, they shared the exes pic and said that the ex is a dancer and is younger than hanbin. its normal ppl will talk about stuff like that between themselves i dont know which one of them was like "lemme expose him", probably someone thats jealous of hanbins life rn</p>
