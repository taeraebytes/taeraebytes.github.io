      <p>I don't think they're gonna have every member on stage but if they do it might be like the gg collab from 2022 but I don't really mind and I expected it anyways I just would rather die than see annoying posts so I blocked everything ðŸ˜Œ

      <p>I think its gonna be 2-3 members from each group since theyâ€™re too many.. probably for zb1 its gonna be gunwook, hanbin or taerae (wishing ricky tho we need that clout for him), riize wonbin, anton and shotaro, bnd would be taesan and jaehyun then for &team could be K and Nicholas</p>

      <p>Idk why people are saying thatâ€™s a collab like the fancall people asked for thei end of year spoilers and giselle did the violin thing in a fancall too, itâ€™s possible that itâ€™s just an orchestra ver of one of their songs. Like not every violin means hao ðŸ˜­ also they have anton in their company who plays string instruments too as far as I know and the chances of sm letting aespa collab with zb1 over riize â€¦ be serious</p>

      <p>Yea I was ab to say Anton plays cello(?) but I didn't wanna get jumped I doubt it but the only thing that would make me think it was possible would be the random tiktok

      <p>I mean I would have believed it if the tiktok was ninghao but it wasnâ€™t so Iâ€™m still not seeing how people made that link ðŸ˜‚ like the op asked aespa for a spoiler for their own end of year stages idk why 2 members would be teasing a collab and the way itâ€™s only zerose saying it too ðŸ˜­</p>
