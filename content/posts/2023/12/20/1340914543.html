      <p>Why do people even call Gyuvin Poop Puppy? Isn't it a skin-ist remark? Is it because he's "tanner" so they call him poop? Reason why I thin this is because I know Koreans always refer to SEA as poop because their skin looks "dirty" for being tanner which is fcked. It's kinda sad how Gyuvin had to come out and say stop calling me poop puppy and to find something else. I think he said he wants to be called Bambi now which is cute</p>

      <p>I don't think it's colorist remark they just give people funny nicknames like karinas stupid cheese cat. and like his fandom uses it a lot and they say it to his face obv I don't think he liked it but poop puppy was more about his personality and tendencies? Like they're basically calling him dumbðŸ˜­ I feel like I saw a translation ab it I kinda get it. and he's not even rlly that tan so I don't think it's ab his skin he just wants a more elegant emoji now but deer isn't gonna happen you have to have a certain type of visual
