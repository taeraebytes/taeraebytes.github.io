      <p>no its an ex bf, the thing started with some (people who knew hanbin or the bf) uni classmates that were talking about it on a gc, they shared the exes pic and said that the ex is a dancer and is younger than hanbin. its normal ppl will talk about stuff like that between themselves i dont know which one of them was like "lemme expose him", probably someone thats jealous of hanbins life rn</p>

      <p>Yeah that's the story I've heard too.
Tbh I know they're trolls so nothing they do is to be taken seriously but I don't understand the need to dig out someone's life when their lives were so,,, normal lol. Especially in the context of them being queer because as a queer person isn't it obvious that they're queer like let's be honest</p>
