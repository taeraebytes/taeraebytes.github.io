      <p>People just admired their chemistry but Wonyoung is shipped more with Ricky and Gyuvin, sometimes gunwook too but those two especially. Ricky and Wonyoung was thing since Bp but recently Gyuvin and Wonyoung has been having so many viral tiktoks . Hanbin has always been shipped with Karina or Winter. Also with Minju and Sullyoon a lot</p>
