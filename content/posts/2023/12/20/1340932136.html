      <p>That Karina hanbin tiktok was so random that I’m actually convinced that she’s the new mca mc or they are working on something together because they were quite close ( not that it’s a bad thing) for that to be their first meeting</p>

      <p>Yeahh like it was so unexpected especially since they already did a tiktok with cline for drama so I don’t think people were really expecting another one, and this was filmed backstage at KBS? And I don’t think aespa filmed with anyone else that day except riize who they did the special stage with but even that was the collab song and not their jingle bell rock cover. Something is definitely cooking there. Plus if they want hype it would make sense because that one random fan account making a fake post about them being the new ikigayo mc duo in July has 45k likes</p>
