 iâ€™m sorry but this is peak ricky autism like gyuvin making ricky say a random phrase and ricky just cluelessly goes along with it and without reading the room he suddenly says an old fashioned slang with no context gagging the others and gyuwook laughing at himâ€¦ obsessed with his perpetual cluelessness he must have a thick head</p>

      <p>Icl this thing of Gyuvin (sometimes yujin but iâ€™ll let him off he  seems influenced easily) making ricky say things he doesnt know is annoying i know theyre friends but hes basically taking advantage of the fact hes a foreigner and enables him to potentially get hate</p>

      <p>on instiz i also see posts talking about how much they dislike gyuvin doing this. i donâ€™t think itâ€™s that serious because ricky knows how to stand up for himself and gyuvin likes ricky way too much to make him say something controversial.</p>
