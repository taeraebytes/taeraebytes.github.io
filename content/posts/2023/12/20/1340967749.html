      <p>no its an ex bf, the thing started with some (people who knew hanbin or the bf) uni classmates that were talking about it on a gc, they shared the exes pic and said that the ex is a dancer and is younger than hanbin. its normal ppl will talk about stuff like that between themselves i dont know which one of them was like "lemme expose him", probably someone thats jealous of hanbins life rn</p>

      <p>did you see the video of him talking about hanbin?, there was a comment from someone names bbeenn_42 they think its hanbin... which would mean that they still have contact or something cause why would you ask if hes cold? which brings me to my next point, haobin is not real (or hanbin just has a healthy relationship with all his exes)</p>

      <p>Considering he had to delete his insta and couldnâ€™t just make it private like the some of the Kepler girls could I doubt he would have a private, especially not one that has
Basically the same username as his old insta.</p>
