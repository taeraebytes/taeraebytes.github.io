      <p>i was just looking at the pics of april 1st during boys planet the day yuehuaz were all out and it was seungeons bday (?), and i sighed so hard they looked so cute and i have to be fr yuehuaz looks like a packaged group even though i dont even have my bias there. also gyuvin was styled much better in bp with his hair, thank god they finally cut that awful mullet today but i feel like they fuck up everyones hair so badly</p>
