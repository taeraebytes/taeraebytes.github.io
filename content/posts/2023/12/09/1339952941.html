      <p>Yes for things like instiz and pann Hanbin is perfect because hes the best member to push 100% the others either have dating rumors, controversial visuals or are Chinese, krosins are very lowkey w Hao and don't post him much on forums because it's just gonna bring him intense hatred from sinophovic people (people there casually wish on a Chinese genocide like it's a different world there) even gunwook or Matthew fans will stay low key</p>
