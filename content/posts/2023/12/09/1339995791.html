 rosins in the qrts are actually psycho like saying the perf will flop or asking the cbar to not buy albums or asking people to boycott over hao not having a solo big. I’m not one to defend allins like I’ll be the first to drag them but them guessing hanbin in the qrts makes a little sense consort his is a hanbin focused account but the rosins are mad weird because calling it Centre erasure like he didn’t have a whole ass solo at the mama intro on day one and then also have his solo moment on the group’s performance too. Bffr some of the members have had nothing and with the way it seems it’s like they are giving the spotlight to different members each perf which I think it good, they really want this group to be hao and friends. Like damn let the other 4 who have had nothing have their moment at least, just greedy and selfish</p>
