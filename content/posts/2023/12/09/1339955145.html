      <p>only current hype hybe group is newjeans. bnd irrelevant, left in the dust. enhyphen still has fans but most knets and fans dropped them cuz of the couple choreo in bite me, members being fatphobic, homophobic and their general off vibes. Idk about seventeen are they part of hybe? hybe be buying all labels so idek anymore.

would love zb1 to do challenges/ collabs with newjeans cause their international hype is insane but i doubt it. It's a shame though since a lot of zb1 members share same age ranges with them and feel like they'd get along but dating scandals are too risky for a rookie group and there's already rumors about gunwookie havign a crush on hanni so... :(</p>

      <p>Some het shipping observation i made from watching all the zb1 reaction videos from MMA
- Gunwook smiles a lot when Hanni speaks , when Rei speaks , they look alike maybe he has a type?
-The members kept looking at Ricky when Wonyoung spoke and he'd start avoiding the screen
-Yujin eyes keep going to Leeseo he probably knows her a lot from school
-They were giving great reaction to kiol
- Taerae cant control himself when he see's pretty girls his hands and eyes were moving fast when he saw Winter and An Yujin walk in his direction

Thats it Jiwoong Hanbin had 0 reaction whatsoever, Matthew is cute cause when they congratulate female idols the male idols usually look away but he was smiling and giving eye contact. And he got caught cheering at the end of Kitsch which was so funny. Jiwoong is scary he legit didnt move an inch the whole show ig he just not interested</p>

      <p>I may be delusional but I think the members are aware that Wonyoung knows of Ricky so that's why they kept looking at him when she spoke because she did his young and Rich tall and handsome, charisma boss baby ricky line but changed it to a feminine one, young and rich tall and beautiful fabulous jang wonyoung and it went viral on jebive twt. Zb1 are known to lurk esp matthew so I'm sure they saw it. 

also when ive won album of the year u can see her looking off to the side where there's a tv screen on the floor and when she saw ricky she turned around to bow to him. I know she bowed to him because I was like NO WAYY I'm not seeing this shit right so I searched up different angles and she was 100% bowing and looking at him. So idk what's going on there but I have my guesses, albeit delusional guesses.

also for jiwoong it's awkward af because he's technically a senior since he already debuted and he's old af compared to the rest of the idols there but at the same time he's a junior cause he just debuted with zb1 so if i were him idk how i'd react either, like one smile at the wrong person, a underage female idol he'll be accused of being a ped0 ðŸ˜­</p>
