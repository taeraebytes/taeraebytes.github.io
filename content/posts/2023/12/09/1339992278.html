      <p>I am sorry to say this but Ricky is not the stone cold bitch you all think he is. Wakeone does not show him to us, any interaction with members gets cut out, He is not even allowed to do Bubble lives or go on Bubble.</p>

      <p>The same anon here and damn, I never heard that bubble audio before. How come jiwoong keeps acting like this with the members but nobody says anything on twitter? And the fan that tweeted this is laughing about it. I can't imagine someone older than me, calling my name like that, to send it to his FANS, like me and that person would end up fighting</p>
