And he doesn't act like that all the time if u want to watch him let loose go watch zb1tv or zepisodes where he puts down his idol persona but i can tell ppl who say what anon says clearly don't. \n\nCan't believe I'm defending ricky here but although he aint my bias his hate is so ridiculously stupid and hating to hate atp. And i agree it's funny because if you do watch more laid back zb1 stuff u can see the difference in his persona off and on stage so when he does 'act' fine it's kinda funny and even cute because we know he's goofy bts.",
    "reply": "Rickys an insecure person so him paying extra attention to his appearance is to be expected and it's his job to be pretty and lmaooooooooo that's funny but he loosens up when he thinks it's appropriate idrc I think it's funny he doesn't let up sometimes"
