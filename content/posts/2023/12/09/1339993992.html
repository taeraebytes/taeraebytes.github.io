      <p>i hope its energetic not boy in luv. boy in luv is like top 10 worst kpop songs and bts cant sing so the entire song is just screaming and rapping and itâ€™s just an insult to zb1â€™s vocal abilities if they had to do that</p>

      <p>insult? as a group boy in luv is better i think only thing id be worried about is the growls that taehyung did but also jimins highnote... energetic would be great too produce song yadda yadda but theyre going to give the wrong people a lot of lines so idk

      <p>Dunno why they chose boy in luv over boy with luv, which would have suited them perfectly</p>
