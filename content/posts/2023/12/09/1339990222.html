      <p>I am sorry to say this but Ricky is not the stone cold bitch you all think he is. Wakeone does not show him to us, any interaction with members gets cut out, He is not even allowed to do Bubble lives or go on Bubble.</p>

      <p>matthew and him are not as close as they once were, hanbin is the leader so he has to listen and interact with jiwoong and tbh i dont think hanbin could be mean to people, so there is that ðŸ˜‚</p>

      <p>Yeah I think if you look at how hanbin interacts with literally any other members esp hao gyuvin Matthew and Gunwook you can see itâ€™s not the same as his interactions with jiwoong. Hell even him and Ricky seemed more relaxed and close in the jacket behind shooting for melting point than hanbin and jiwoong</p>

      <p>i think the boys know that jiwoongs "rumour" could blow up in their faces, they kinda know everything thats going on in the fandom. jiwoong probably reassured them that its fine and the fans wont talk about it, but if i were a member, i would be worrying</p>
