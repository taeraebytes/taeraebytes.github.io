      <p>im suprised hanbin hasnt made any idol friends (that we know of) despite being an MC. Like hao has already become close friends with Chenle, Jun and prob other c-line idols. And matthew has Canada line</p>

      <p>Do you think hao genuinely means the friendship he has been trying to form with these idols or just want to leech of them. I mean we know how introvert he is yet out of everyone in the group itâ€™s him whoâ€™s trying to initiate these friendships makes me think he has some ulterior motives idk</p>

      <p>he has said he was an exrtovert person in China and loved outings he prolly just turned introvert when he came korea, new environment new people + covid was around
I don't think he's leeching of based on how the other c idols have talked abt him (winwin kun renjun jun..) and he seems genuinely close to chenle</p>

      <p>He initiates the friendships so he defnitely is trying to make connections which is good. He is extremely smart. Even with hanbin, he initiated and it worked. He doesn't trend on instiz unless its with the ship. But he does not post with hanbin on chinese platforms, does he. Hanbin is always willing to give him(and any of his members tbh) a shoutout but hao does not talk about him on his bubble or c platforms except for that paris live which was most likely w1's push.</p>

      <p>if hao were to talk about hanbin on his bubble live his whole chat would spam vomit emojis and talk shit, he knows his how his fandom works do you think he want to be in such a position? the first time hanbin talked about hao on his bubble live i saw someone commenting vomit emojis but before i could report it someone else did, after that something like that didnt happen again</p>

      <p>Hanbin faces hate on every platform but still talks about his members, giving hao exposure to his solos and the korean side where he dominates. Hao can do the same , help hanbin in exposure to the chinese side where he is popular , with a simple post or mention but he does not do it lol instead he will pop up in hanbin's live many times.</p>

      <p>exposure...? Anyone that knows hanbin knows hao ðŸ˜­ and even if he posted with hanbin on a Chinese platform things wouldn't be swell like you think their own shipper fans say a lot anti stuff ab them and hanbin will just get dragged by rosins that hate him

      <p>Iâ€™d rather hao not have hanbin in his lives or expose him to his cfans, the already drag him for existing in the same group letâ€™s not add fuel to that fire</p>
