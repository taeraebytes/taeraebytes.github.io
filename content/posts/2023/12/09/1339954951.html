      <p>To think this could've been Hao too if he didn't end up P01 and the center and didn't have a solid fanbase omfg... Not like what he gets is half what he actually deserves but wow wakeone needs to go to hell for how they treat the foreigners</p>

      <p>Yes it's scary how if he wasn't center and didn't have a strong fandom things would b a lot worse for him

      <p>Not really? Look at xiaoting. She is treated like the centre. Hao is treated very much like the centre. Variety show intros, screentime,tiktoks,lines, standing in the middle. What more is needed? Even wony wasnt trated like that.</p>

      <p>Not the same anon, I‚Äôm not saying they treat hao amaong in other aspects but if we look exclusively at his position as centre as the group I can tell you right now as someone whose followed all produce groups since ioi that he‚Äôs the best treated ( and I mean this exclusively in terms of his position as centre) people like to say wakeone is trying to push rotating or more than 1 centre but I promise you go to any other produce groups and you will see what a rotating centre is because it will make it so clear to anyone that hao is treated as the only centre in zb1 whereas in every other produce group there has always been 2/3 members that were pushed into that centre position. And let‚Äôs not bring up Kepler because I don‚Äôt even think anyone outside the fandom even knows chaehyun is the centre.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôd hardly say fallen from grace because it‚Äôs not like the rest of the wanna one members are doing much better than him, and the ones that are are known for their acting rather than their music</p>
