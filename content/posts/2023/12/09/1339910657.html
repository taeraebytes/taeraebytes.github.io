      <p>only current hype hybe group is newjeans. bnd irrelevant, left in the dust. enhyphen still has fans but most knets and fans dropped them cuz of the couple choreo in bite me, members being fatphobic, homophobic and their general off vibes. Idk about seventeen are they part of hybe? hybe be buying all labels so idek anymore.

would love zb1 to do challenges/ collabs with newjeans cause their international hype is insane but i doubt it. It's a shame though since a lot of zb1 members share same age ranges with them and feel like they'd get along but dating scandals are too risky for a rookie group and there's already rumors about gunwookie havign a crush on hanni so... :(</p>

      <p>Some het shipping observation i made from watching all the zb1 reaction videos from MMA
- Gunwook smiles a lot when Hanni speaks , when Rei speaks , they look alike maybe he has a type?
-The members kept looking at Ricky when Wonyoung spoke and he'd start avoiding the screen
-Yujin eyes keep going to Leeseo he probably knows her a lot from school
-They were giving great reaction to kiol
- Taerae cant control himself when he see's pretty girls his hands and eyes were moving fast when he saw Winter and An Yujin walk in his direction

Thats it Jiwoong Hanbin had 0 reaction whatsoever, Matthew is cute cause when they congratulate female idols the male idols usually look away but he was smiling and giving eye contact. And he got caught cheering at the end of Kitsch which was so funny. Jiwoong is scary he legit didnt move an inch the whole show ig he just not interested</p>
