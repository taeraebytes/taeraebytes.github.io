      <p>they kind of are if you consider who has more fans riize doesn't have a strong core fandom they have the highest charting bg song but with talk saxy flopping and the scandals and removing a member ehhhhhh they're still big tho zb1 lost a lot but they still have more fans as of rn

      <p>i think riize and zb1 are kinda equal rn with zb1 having the bigger fanbase but riize having more gp recognition but i feel like riize is going to grow bigger than zb1 soon. saying this as a zerose. their mama stages got more attention than zb1 despite zb1 having more budget (and being more interesting imo ðŸ˜ª)</p>

      <p>but anon the gp recognition is from all their scandals and controversies. If I was nosey I'd too want to tune it to their very first stage at 6. But ngl some controversies will help us so who we sacrificing? ðŸ‘¿</p>

      <p>There's been some micro scandal and tea but zeroses hide it bcs for ex they don't like Jiwoong but his rumors might affect their big3 (Hanbin Hao Yujin) and since it's only 2 years they're keeping it lowk but idk if it'll last bcs there's a lot of frustration</p>

      <p>one of the reasons wakeone doesnt care what jiwoong does, they put him into the back of their minds, they were pretty generous with his screen time on todays zepisode, but i know that if they were to start pushing jw a lot of subfandoms would start taking out their receipts about his life.</p>

      <p>That's why I'm thinking he def won't get a season 2 or anything like his show again (which I don't get why they gave him since he's not a variety member) they also used to push woongsungz as the visual duo but they might switch to haobin for max profit or if they're not ready for that kind of commitment Hanbin)yujin</p>

      <p>Ig the whole concept of his show was supposed to be like Sakura's show (older experienced idol trying out new things) since they're both by the same studio but Jiwoong doesn't have the same variety presence and charisma to pull it off like Sakura did</p>
