      <p>I am sorry to say this but Ricky is not the stone cold bitch you all think he is. Wakeone does not show him to us, any interaction with members gets cut out, He is not even allowed to do Bubble lives or go on Bubble.</p>

      <p>think of zb1 as a group of friends, you're chill with all 8 but only close-close with 2-3 as in you're comfortable enough to do weird goofy shit, gossiping, be yourself without the fear of being judged. There's absolutely nothing wrong with have 2-3 close friends and I think it's probably the norm in most friend groups and honestly it's mentally healthier that way.

I guess when anon said he doesn't fw half the group it came out sounding like he hates half the group so I can see why the other anon thought that way but otherwise not a bad thing at all to have only 2-3 close friends/ bestiesszzzz in a friend group.</p>

      <p>Jiwoong doesn't look like he's close w anyone maybe Matthew, Gyuvin and Hanbin at most?
Hao is Hanbin, Taerae and Gunwook tho I think he likes shimkongz too
Hanbin is Gyuvin Hao
Taerae is Matthew Gyuvin Hao
Ricky is maknae line
Gunwook is maknae line
Yujin is maknae line
I do think Gyuvin is pretty close to everybody though, that's his role in the group</p>

      <p>Ppl exaggerate the hariboz dynamic because they are both Chinese lol the only time they ever interact is when they’re filming challenges, I still genuinely think gyuwook are closest to Ricky because they are the only ones that he’s shown his real personality to</p>
