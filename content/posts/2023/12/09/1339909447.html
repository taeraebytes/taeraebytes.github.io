      <p>real question for those who follow 🍚 are they fun as a group? I have seen some videos and they seem so boring and awkward :O I don't see the appeal in them plus they're also not as good looking as xo</p>

      <p>I have little hope in the yuehua group and the others will probably be scattered around with mid trainees in other groups so I won't give a shit bc I like the group dynamic not them individually.. like I honestly see hao and ricky doing the same thing the chinese girls from wjsn did BUT let me put the negativity down since we still have 2 years left</p>
