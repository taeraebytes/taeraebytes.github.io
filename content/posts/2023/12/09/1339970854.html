      <p>he has said he was an exrtovert person in China and loved outings he prolly just turned introvert when he came korea, new environment new people + covid was around
I don't think he's leeching of based on how the other c idols have talked abt him (winwin kun renjun jun..) and he seems genuinely close to chenle</p>

      <p>He initiates the friendships so he defnitely is trying to make connections which is good. He is extremely smart. Even with hanbin, he initiated and it worked. He doesn't trend on instiz unless its with the ship. But he does not post with hanbin on chinese platforms, does he. Hanbin is always willing to give him(and any of his members tbh) a shoutout but hao does not talk about him on his bubble or c platforms except for that paris live which was most likely w1's push.</p>

      <p>didnâ€™t rosins lock haoâ€™s topic on instiz bc his posts were getting stormed with hate every time? like iâ€™m not saying he would be top 10 trending all the time bc it definetely wouldnâ€™t be the case, but i also always found it a little that hb is always top 10 trending when there are a lot of idols who are way more popular in sk? sure maybe hanbin is one the few male 5th gen idols that have at least some sort of recognition by gp, but heâ€™s definitely not one of the most popular idols overall? but idk how instiz work so</p>

      <p>Hmm the only way I can explain this is using someone like kang Daniel ( no Iâ€™m not saying hanbin is kang Daniel) but what I am saying is it may seem weird to us because heâ€™s not the most popular internationally but he is very popular domestically and among the kr gp aswell. Like kd isnâ€™t that popular internationally but heâ€™s always topping br in kr and naver. Tbh I thought his fans were exaggerating his popularity over there but I went over in august for a summer trip and turns out he actually is just that popular there. Also the trending on instiz has nothing to do with locked post because even though his post were locked he still trended at 10 on the day of mama ( day 1)</p>

      <p>Hanbin is most popular domestically and is 2nd most popular intlly unlike daniel who had his popularity based entirely in korea. He's fine for a 5ht gen. Korea is still ruled by 3rd gen. 

Regarding hao, even if posts are locked, they can trend. The one time i saw him trending high with high views was the covid news. He never had any other viral posts. Even neulbin has no virality. Trending is different. Viral is different. Many people posting at the same time causes trends. Group and member posts are usually locked.</p>

      <p>I think Ricky is in the same dilemma as Gunwook where they're both handsome and good looking in their own way but too "strong" for the gp whereas Hao and Yujin fits China's beauty standard</p>

      <p>he recently went viral for his black hair and gained like 12k new fans in 2 days.

he's quite unpopular for a chinese idol but there's reasons for that: he got no screentime during bp and wasn't pushed by his label. he was the only trainee for whom yuehua didn't buy weibo trends, duhua also didn't mention him by name and would leave him out of her promo. ppl didn't know he was chinese so by the time of bp finale, his supertonic only had 8k (hao for comparison already had more than 100k by then). c-netz we're focusing on debuting hao so they guilt tripping people who supported ricky with "if u support him, hao will suffer" "only one can make it". that's when crosins started spreading rumors that ricky is mixed to make ppl drop him and support "pure chinese" hao. it led to the main bp weibo acc banning ricky from being posted which again led to even more ppl not knowing about his existence. when he deduted it was a big controversy in china bc ppl were accusing him of being rigged in since they had no idea he was popular overseas and korea. a big conspiracy theory about how mnet swapped yujin's and ricky's ranking to make it more dramatic was born. to this day ricky gets hate bc people think he "stole" yujin's rank. then ricky's bday live happened and he made a joke about yujin "not having good sense" and yujin's c-fans, already hating ricky for "taking yujin's rank", got mad and started hate train on him. they tried to gid up dirt on him but found nothing so they just made shit up about him being rude and mixed. then ricky posted a pic on twt where hao wasn't in the frame and c-rosins got mad claiming he cropped him out on purpose which led to like a week long war between sfs with ricky getting more damage due to his smaller fandom size. ricky is pretty hated by two of the biggest zb1 c-fanbases so everytime he goes viral, like recently, they (mostly rosins) report his viral posts, spam his hashtags with unflattering pics, gore etc etc.

ricky is pretty unpopular for a chinese member but he's gaining new fans fast. most of the fans he has now started stanning after debut meanwhile hao and yujin's fanbase are the ones who were with them since bp and their growth is much slower</p>

      <p>Ricky looks so Chinese I do think screentime contributed the whole oh cfans didn't know he was Chinese bit is just wrong they knew just didn't care and yea I thought only one Chinese trainee would make it being ofc and yujins rank dropped cuz his kfans did charity for gyuvin and jiwoong lol 

Well hope he makes it big
