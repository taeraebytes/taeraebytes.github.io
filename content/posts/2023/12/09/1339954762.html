      <p>To think this could've been Hao too if he didn't end up P01 and the center and didn't have a solid fanbase omfg... Not like what he gets is half what he actually deserves but wow wakeone needs to go to hell for how they treat the foreigners</p>

      <p>Yes it's scary how if he wasn't center and didn't have a strong fandom things would b a lot worse for him

      <p>Not really? Look at xiaoting. She is treated like the centre. Hao is treated very much like the centre. Variety show intros, screentime,tiktoks,lines, standing in the middle. What more is needed? Even wony wasnt trated like that.</p>

      <p>tbh i agree when rosins complained about mistreatment its only valid when its abt less solo jobs but not about center treatment in group songs, mvs, screentimes & thumbnails bc he's treated WELL as a center. like most zb1 youtube thumbnail always only making his face bigger than the rest etc like thats a center treatment and i dont think rosin should complain abt that</p>

      <p>Plus solo jobs are an anomaly too because 99% of solo jobs are based off invite, like wakeone isn‚Äôt getting a say in who these big producers brands invite to their stuff. People need to pick a narrative because one day it‚Äôs wakeone is broke and nugu and can‚Äôt promote the boys and the other it‚Äôs wakwone is getting all these solo opportunities for X, Y and Z.</p>

      <p>The invites happen but I don't think it's 99% probably more like 60-50% except for the brand stuff

      <p>another anon here but didnt they invite him because they wanted someone to wear their clothes? hanbin, jiwoong are kinda with gucci, hao was dressed in loewe, so im guessing yujin got himself a deal with sofia coppola. new jeans for example are really young but still are ambassadors. it would make sense for yujin to be the next in line for a brand deal (or whatever zb1 has going on with brands).</p>

      <p>I thought it was a book event not like a brand event yujin could get a brand deal in the future but njns are diff they're 10x more popular and are from a company w good marketing and moneyüò≠
