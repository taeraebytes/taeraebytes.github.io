      <p>it's bcs tmh is too fast and too high to be sung by one person..but yeh he shouldve chosen songs that suit his tone or at least they shouldve rearranged the song idk</p>

      <p>his tone doesn't match the song and he has a limited range as a singer but I think he had to choose a song from the mini or smth

      <p>I don't even think it's his tone, he just sounds strained no matter what song he signs no hate just something I noticed and don't like about his singing.</p>

      <p>Is it true survival group never have a vocal leason like it's already 2nd comeback but i don't see the improve with some members like yujin gyuvin jiwoong and matthew, even hanbin is still mediocre, ngl i think they will give hanbin some leasons since he got highnotes the most since he's not hao and taerae level</p>

      <p>i feel like yujin improved or at least got a little more confident with time, also why is the company so keen on giving hanbin high notes that he canâ€™t sing properly like that note in take my hand is just painful, he is not there yet, pleease either give him lessons or stop giving him all the highnotes or scrap the notes or autotune them idk ðŸ˜­  it just really throws me off when you can hear how bad itâ€™s executed on an official recording and i canâ€™t enjoy the song fullyâ€¦</p>

      <p>Yujin did improve a lot and definitely more confident sometimes he wouldn't even attempt to sing on stage it was crazy 
I'm rlly not sure why they give it to him either even the studio versions sound strained but I heard a lot of the producers that work with them don't actually meet them so they just make songs and wakeone assigns them they probably like his voice or smth but imo haorae are the better option esp hao since he has the highest range I think
