      <p>real question for those who follow üçö are they fun as a group? I have seen some videos and they seem so boring and awkward :O I don't see the appeal in them plus they're also not as good looking as xo</p>

      <p>The way I know that if the members had their own IG accounts they would start gaining fans, idc if ifs too early for rookies to open their own IG accounts. Most kpop fans follow idols that have a cool feed or are funny, thats the kind of exposure the boys need. I'm not a fan of TikTok unless you want to promote your album/comeback</p>
