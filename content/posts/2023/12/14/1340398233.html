      <p>different anon but there was a fansign pic from a few days/weeks (?) ago that got ratioed quite a bit on the k-side and all the quotes were comments of concern, asking him to eat more etc and i agree bc there was something about the way his head/neck looked like they looked reallyyyyyy skinny in a way that didn't match his body idk how to explain it but yeah. it wasn't like a typical fansite pic in that it was whitewashed, filtered or anything, it looked more like a fan who wasn't a fansite took it on their phone or a good quality camera, so i doubt his features were edited (though idk where the original tweet/pic is so i can't link it soz). i think he's pretty rough on himself in that regard it makes me sad</p>

      <p>It‚Äôs sad to say but speaking from experience someone who looses an extreme amount of weight ( he lost 30kg) often find it hard to not get stuck in the mindset of needing to be perfect/ stay thin. I think if you actually watch him in their content especially when they are eating it‚Äôs very obvious he‚Äôs careful around food and I guess coming from loosing that much weight to being in an industry that glorifies certain body types doesn‚Äôt help</p>

      <p>also since he lost sm, his current weight is prob significantly lower than his set point so it‚Äôs prob sm harder to maintain than someone who was naturally thin bc his body literally gain back to where its comfortable. 

i think he can sort of correct this if he starts bulking and focuses on weightlifting/muscle hypertrophy but he seems to always want to do cardio which is actually counterproductive üò≠ but this process takes time and it‚Äôs pretty hard, esp given he‚Äôs in the spotlight 24/7</p>

      <p>Ive seen the way he talks ab good sometimes it's concerning I hope he learns what's best for his body food and training wise I'm sure his fans would get upset if he expressed any wish of bulking up

      <p>bbsongee is shitting on matthew for bulking and so are the QRT but matthew is a diff case because he's short so bulking makes him look even shorter and wider which isnt helping his proportions. I think it's not much of looking like a twink but they like that long limb aesthetic and bulking would make u look opposite of that</p>
