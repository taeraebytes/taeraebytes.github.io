      <p>not really shocking because boys planet was this year and who was talked about the most intl? the bl actor üòÇ. koreans use their own websites. i personally thought ricky would be in the top5</p>

      <p>Ricky popularity is mostly with non-fans and Tiktok fans in the 10's. He's popular but theres no reason to search him but at the bginning of Boys Planet everyone was discussing Jiwoongs kiss scenes and Bl's. Jiwoong is more likely to have a stable fanbase even as ZB1 ends more than ricky imo</p>

      <p>jiwoong has a much smaller fanbase I'd say they're more dedicated but I don't think jiwoongs is more stable he didnt receive an in ear till recently he barely gets fan gifts like Ricky is definitely for the non fans but he's younger and trendier plus his fans are seriously batshit crazy
