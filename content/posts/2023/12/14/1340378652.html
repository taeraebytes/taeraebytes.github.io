      <p>This makes me laugh because hao fans were arguing with Ricky fans every month about who the most searched member was just for jiwoong to swoop in and take it. Although that does make me curious how rosins were making these charts because if hao was constantly topping them why didn‚Äôt he make the top 5 especially over some rookies who debuted in September</p>

      <p>I'm not really sure I mean worldwide google is what's being counted rn and hao wasn't popular to begin with jiwoong created a buzz before the show even started and it went viral everywhere so I can understand why he got this

      <p>ricky IS the most searched and by far. fandoms just completely exclude his result because ricky is a common name but funnily enough if you look at the most related terms to the name ricky in google searches zb1 and boysplanet show up üò≠  that's why riyangis and rosins were fighting</p>
