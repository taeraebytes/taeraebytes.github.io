      <p>Sorry I have to defend my gay brothers Haobin don't bait remotely as much as Gyuvin come on, the only crazy thing they say were on fansigns and even then there weren't that much mostly daily anecdotes, when haobin are together they mostly interact normally (they were baiting during bp but it was for survival!!)</p>
