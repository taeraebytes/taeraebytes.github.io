      <p>Tbh I just think they haven‚Äôt been allowed to film it, hanbin mentioned in a fansign during in bloom that he wanted to try the hood me tight challenges but that it might be hard to because too much ‚Äòcontent‚Äô is being uploaded. Even now his cover went viral but it‚Äôs not even an actual tiktok he did it in bubble live so it‚Äôs clear that the company is just simply not letting some of them use jt</p>

      <p>riize are doing a double song w a Japanese release probably gonna try to target that market simultaneously which is gonna tank them and they're probably not gonna release a song like gag zb1s socmed team isn't sabotaging them just stunting any fame they could get from there

      <p>i think the double release might help them tbh bc they‚Äôre doing both japan and kor promo at the same time im assuming. most kpop fans/korean gp don‚Äôt tune into japanese release so for them, zb1 won‚Äôt have a cb for a while since the japanese album is in march. also the new song is gonna b emo pop so im assuming boy band type shit and it‚Äôs a first love concept so no noise so the gp will def eat it up especially since they‚Äôre under big4</p>

      <p>they both flopped w their cbs but the difference is riize is getting sm engagement and attention for year end performances and also their upcoming cb and they‚Äôre also gaining fans at a very rapid pace. their music is also pretty gp friendly so they have a high likelihood of pulling gag numbers w their cb. zb1 had the hype w in bloom and lost it and they are growing again, but it‚Äôs a slower pace and the japanese cb and fancon won‚Äôt help bc they‚Äôll be out of korean eye for a while possibly until the summer, when they‚Äôll have another korean cb</p>
