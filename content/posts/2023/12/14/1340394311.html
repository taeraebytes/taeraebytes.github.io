      <p>Tbh I just think they havenâ€™t been allowed to film it, hanbin mentioned in a fansign during in bloom that he wanted to try the hood me tight challenges but that it might be hard to because too much â€˜contentâ€™ is being uploaded. Even now his cover went viral but itâ€™s not even an actual tiktok he did it in bubble live so itâ€™s clear that the company is just simply not letting some of them use jt</p>

      <p>riize are doing a double song w a Japanese release probably gonna try to target that market simultaneously which is gonna tank them and they're probably not gonna release a song like gag zb1s socmed team isn't sabotaging them just stunting any fame they could get from there

      <p>i think the double release might help them tbh bc theyâ€™re doing both japan and kor promo at the same time im assuming. most kpop fans/korean gp donâ€™t tune into japanese release so for them, zb1 wonâ€™t have a cb for a while since the japanese album is in march. also the new song is gonna b emo pop so im assuming boy band type shit and itâ€™s a first love concept so no noise so the gp will def eat it up especially since theyâ€™re under big4</p>

      <p>I mean ig korea rlly does love fake washes y2k attempts cuz newjeans don't do it and gag was not even close to 2000s it was maroon 5 2015 realness we'll have to see they have an interesting discog so far I'd say only memories and gag are somewhat similar

      <p>YITS 150M streams MP 56M streams on Melon OP can go cry. You can buy chart you canâ€™t buy stream 
Also zb1 with no Japanese release:

      <p>unique listeners are more important than streams and thatâ€™s what gets acts to chart well. yits did good but mp made no gp noise, all the streaming came from the same few ppl so we had very weak digital points. also iâ€™m literally a zerose</p>
