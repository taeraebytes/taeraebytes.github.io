      <p>not really shocking because boys planet was this year and who was talked about the most intl? the bl actor üòÇ. koreans use their own websites. i personally thought ricky would be in the top5</p>

      <p>Ricky popularity is mostly with non-fans and Tiktok fans in the 10's. He's popular but theres no reason to search him but at the bginning of Boys Planet everyone was discussing Jiwoongs kiss scenes and Bl's. Jiwoong is more likely to have a stable fanbase even as ZB1 ends more than ricky imo</p>

      <p>jiwoong has a much smaller fanbase I'd say they're more dedicated but I don't think jiwoongs is more stable he didnt receive an in ear till recently he barely gets fan gifts like Ricky is definitely for the non fans but he's younger and trendier plus his fans are seriously batshit crazy

      <p>all the search results for ricky are not accurate because of his name. honestly i wouldn't be surprised if he's the most searched but sfs of other members usually disregard his results bc "ricky is a common name" and they usually only count his results like "ricky zb1" "ricky boysplanet" etc. it's hard to tell how much he's actually getting searched</p>

      <p>Even if they only tap ricky nothing regarding rick appears (like really nothing on Google) so it doesn‚Äôt affect his searches. Only zb1 ricky shows results regarding him (on the contrary with some members they have 2 searches terms so it even split their searches (ex Kim Ji-Woong as music artist 
 and Kim Jiwoong)</p>
