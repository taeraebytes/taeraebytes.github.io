      <p>It's hard to explain but yeah it is, although the main userbase is mainly men, the kpop related galleries (subforums or topics basically) tend to be female dominant I think?

It all depends tbh because some galleries are nice where they mostly post news and have organised fansupport projects and stuff. But there's also pretty terrible antifan galleries as well like Kang Daniel suing the Produce Season 2 gallery or Twice smear campaign organised by "Slave Room" for example</p>
