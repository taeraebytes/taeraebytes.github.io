      <p>Ricky popularity is mostly with non-fans and Tiktok fans in the 10's. He's popular but theres no reason to search him but at the bginning of Boys Planet everyone was discussing Jiwoongs kiss scenes and Bl's. Jiwoong is more likely to have a stable fanbase even as ZB1 ends more than ricky imo</p>

      <p>jiwoong has a much smaller fanbase I'd say they're more dedicated but I don't think jiwoongs is more stable he didnt receive an in ear till recently he barely gets fan gifts like Ricky is definitely for the non fans but he's younger and trendier plus his fans are seriously batshit crazy

      <p>Ricky is ‚Äútrendy‚Äù but only on SNS, people will like his TikTok and insta posts but they won‚Äôt actually spend money on him, which is not a good mesure of stable fanbase; same for JW honestly even his mercies in Korea can‚Äôt sell the payola with him is üíÄ that‚Äôs why they always need to pair him with more relevant members.</p>

      <p>wdym? Not even a riyangi but when me and my moots are looking for group orders Ricky's pc is always one of the first to be claimed and his spot is always taken. His digipack is always sold out too. If ur basing your stats on korean/ japanese market then yeah he's like 5th/7th but that's not where his "sns" audience is... in the West where his actual audience is he's doing really well, if not the best out of everyone.

idk y ppl are so keen on dismissing his tiktok and ig fans like it's so weird?? And if I'm being honest, with what's happening recently with all the non sense hate he gets for going viral and wakeone's mistreatment a lot of those casual fans are turning into hardcore stans.
