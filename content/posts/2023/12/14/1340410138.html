      <p>i find it so funny how everyone is so convinced that haobin are real when they follow the same formula as every other kpop group and they swear it’s different w them but that’s what literally every kpop stan says. like without fail every group has that one pairing composed of the 2 most popular members and zb1 is not the exception</p>
