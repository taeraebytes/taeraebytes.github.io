      <p>yeah? just because their dynamic is more flirty doesn't automatically mean it's a bait. some friendships are just like that. gyubrik isn't even popular of a ship for him to be doing all that</p>

      <p>anon what do you mean their dynamic is more flirty? rickys doesnt even play into that, gyuvins trying to do all the work because he knows fans go crazy for moments like that. he obviously wants what haobin have (popularity wise)</p>
