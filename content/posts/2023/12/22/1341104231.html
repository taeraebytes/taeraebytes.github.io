      <p>No I'm aware how good gag is charting but saying they'll easily surpass tbz is just crazy when they haven't proved at all that they can recreate gag success if they could make talk saxy would've done better which got promoted just as much gag on social media

      <p>true i guess we have to wait to see how the next cb will do but i still stand by the fact that i think in a year or so time they will exceed tbz and every other 4th gen bg except for probably txt in domestic/gp popularity. they're also under sm which is an advantage bc sm bgs have all done really well</p>

      <p>That all depends it's possible they could but I doubt it especially with the new gg sm is coming out with their focus won't be on riize as much it's just a pattern they have they really might send riize overseas when this group comes out like the focus is on ggs rn

      <p>the new gg is not debuting under the same production center as riize tho so i dont think it will matter they both operate completely differently and have different management teams. unless u mean the fans will shift their focus but bg fans are usually pretty loyal. also the focus is only on ggs bc no bgs have released anything good or been memorable but that can very much change. also why the fuck would they send riize overseas that doesnt make any sense, 6/7 members are korean and only one speaks english. the members themselves are just more westernized in terms of music taste and aesthetic ig but theyre still a korean group and sm's first boygroup in 7 years</p>

      <p>sm has been trying to get western fame for their groups for ages they're just shit at it do u not rmbr that disaster of 2018-2019 for 127 where they were always trying to push them into the western world and riize had their first stages in America and did promo with a zillion white American tiktoker everyone knows they're going to have a global focus with riize. why do u think they make the members lip sync in English and all their tiktoks are targeting the American tiktok demographic please let's put two and two together
