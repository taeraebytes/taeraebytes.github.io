      <p>which begs the question for me about what the point of making these groups temporary even is... like if none of the produce members except iz*one were super successful after disbandment, why continue to make them temporary when they could reach much bigger heights (and make much more money for the companies) together? Like a lot of the reason people don't want to get into zb1 or any other produce groups is because they are temporary so if they had longer contracts, more people would probably be willing to get into them and also they wouldn't be having to put out content at breakneck speeds which would allow them to have more natural growth rather than just peaking at debut like most produce groups. And the fandom would be so much less hostile too because everyone wouldn't be in competition to make their faves the most popular so that when the group disbands they'll have the best career. Which would also make more people want to get into them because the toxic ass fandom is what turns a lot of people off. I'm just thinking that if the point of having these temporary groups is so that they'll gain popularity and translate into popular groups based off of the members but 9/10 times the members flop after disbandment or even if they don't flop they'll never reach the height of their produce career then why keep this model? It's not like it's not possible for the contracts to be longer anyways, X1 was supposed to have a 7 year contract right?</p>

      <p>It's more like these companies are loaning their trainees then bringing them back to their respective companies. I'm sure the original idea was that they wanted to have their idols back and famous in their own companies which I guess you could say is still true all the groups post produce idols debut in wouldnt have been nearly as popular without the produce idols. The companies that use produce shows are notorious for being bad and they're just using the shows as an easy way out. X1 was supposed to be 5 years which is long for produce standards

      <p>Just another perspective too, originally the boys planet group was supposed to be a permanent group and the auditions were only open to trainees who had no company ( which is what I’m assuming their are doing with the iland 2 trainees) however it got delayed because they weren’t having enough applications so they opened it up to company trainees but as a result of that they had to make the group temporary because no company is going to want their trainee to debut in a group that has the possibility to be super popular and then not want them back to try and profit off them more</p>

      <p>the most clever thing for them to do is to prolong the contracts to at least 5 years and have the remaining 2.5 years be a mix of zb1 under w1 and whatever promos their own companies want them to do, all will be getting their purse that way</p>

      <p>they get to cb twice a year for example, the whole month of the cb or two months is full focus on the group and the rest is individual promos or whatever they want to do with their original companies, if they need to do world tours or sth then they can arrange that somehow. fans can learn to either shut up or have to see their faves go to nugudom, most certainly none of them is surviving anywhere near zb1 level after disbandment</p>
