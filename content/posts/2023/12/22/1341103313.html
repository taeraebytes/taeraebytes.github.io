      <p>I think the process for tiktok is prob this :
members freely do challenges/ tiktoks > members send video to wakeone/ management/ tiktok manager or who ever for screening/ approval > wakeone post it for them or gives the member the go ahead to post it themselves.

If Ricky is constantly sending wakeone stuff but wakeone isn't posting it or letting him post it that is restricting him.</p>
