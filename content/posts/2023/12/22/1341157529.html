      <p>Gunwook is definitely going to be an idol again 2/3 of jelpiz left I don't see why he'd stay and the company is just so terrible i wish him the best I hope his future is good to him. it rlly all depends on how popular he gets while in zb1 and his popularity is growing fast but we'll see

      <p>this is where your bias gets to your head cuz there's no way gunwook is gonna be successful after zb1. even in zb1 he's a flop</p>

      <p>I said it depends on his fame in zb1...? But even then if debuts in a shit lineup he's done like I'm being realistic w everybody puhlease and his popularity never staggered how would he be a flop if he placed 5th generally he's popular intl and he's ok in korea

      <p>that is the delusion speaking, barely any idol has made it in SMTM and any idol that has made it past round one can actually write, compose and has something completely unique to them, gw does not have these qualities</p>
