      <p>not rly yall are underestimating how well get a guitar is doing in sk and if they play their cards right they might be able to replicate its sucess with their newest cb. zeroses cannot speak when zb1 is tanking over there</p>

      <p>No I'm aware how good gag is charting but saying they'll easily surpass tbz is just crazy when they haven't proved at all that they can recreate gag success if they could make talk saxy would've done better which got promoted just as much gag on social media

      <p>true i guess we have to wait to see how the next cb will do but i still stand by the fact that i think in a year or so time they will exceed tbz and every other 4th gen bg except for probably txt in domestic/gp popularity. they're also under sm which is an advantage bc sm bgs have all done really well</p>

      <p>That all depends it's possible they could but I doubt it especially with the new gg sm is coming out with their focus won't be on riize as much it's just a pattern they have they really might send riize overseas when this group comes out like the focus is on ggs rn
