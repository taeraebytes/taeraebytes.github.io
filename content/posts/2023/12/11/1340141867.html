      <p>Tea

jiwoong indeed had a gf theyâ€™ve been dating for 3 years and she has money so he kinda won, he also used to be a big perv and interact with a bunch of his foreign fans back then

hao is still being targeted by trolls and his ex fling till this day, unfortunately his digital footprint is too huge heâ€™s never gonna be able to come back from it.

i got the most on ricky tho, lol socal is crazy. he went to ocsa, crean but also portola high school as well. the troll anon who said he had an absent father wasnâ€™t wrong. his parents arenâ€™t legally married in the US by law but thatâ€™s understandable considering the transition for legal marriage stuff is hella hard for a lot of foreigners. I have photos of his older brother and sisters + both of his younger sisters are on ig but Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve seen them before already. Hereâ€™s him back in LA tho, lol you can already kinda guess what kinda kid he was
