      <p>what if i say there was a reason yujin (the member that jiwoong fans think hes closest to) didnt pick jiwoong as the member he woulf introduce his imaginary sister to, the second pick on that team was gunwook. that shows me that hanbin and gunwook are probably the greenest flags, and jiwoongs relationship is not as great as they make it to be.

yujin also mentioned hanbins name as his role model in that trivia show
