      <p>i think theyre just incompetent they have to apply for work visas everytime they travel internationally for work schedules probably the paperwork was not on standard maybe he got denied i did hear some people say its harder for chinese passports to get work visas thru korea but i dont think its an issue of wakeone specifically targetting ricky the incident in jeju was him not bringing the passport all tgthr bcuz he wasnt informed. something similar also happened to ningning before apparently its sad i feel bad like hes gonna b alone but im sure they had time to fix it they fly the day of
