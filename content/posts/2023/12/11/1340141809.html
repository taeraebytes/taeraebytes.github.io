      <p>-Ryujin x haechan was real yeah they broke up tho
-Jeno x mina was also real
-That one girl from wonder girls is queer and used to look for bottoms on the internet she's now married to a guy tho
-Wjsn seolha has a non celebrity gf
-This is only speculation but a lot of people think qsoob was a thing and that makes sense to me, once they properly broke up q started dating this dumbass influencer girl who wasn't subtle at all about the fact they were dating lmao and soobin might be dating keonhee
- mark GOT7 and Nancy momoland used to date and she wasn't subtle about it
- key/woohyun used to date and then key dated a super masc model..they seem to have made up now tho
-on that matter im pretty sure the long term gay couple from the same group that dispatch wanted to expose was from infinite too
-yunho tvxq used to frequent gay bars but now was exposed to go to shady massage parlorsðŸ¤¢
-onew has sexual assault accusations and is an alcoholic and drug addict
-rora from babymonster went on hiatus for a while to fix up her face
-jun svt mom is a total stage mom and spread nasty shit about Minghao
That's just from the top of my head</p>

      <p>oh lemme dig in

yea the nct couples were real I knew ab ryuhaech a good 6 months before it got leakedðŸ˜­
was her name dabin? Yea she was on some queer forum right 
seolha ðŸ˜³?
I am an expert on qsoob I lived through that I was in the trenches in 2021 ngl I hated it soobin and txt ruined my life but I can't lie to you.. there's tea there and when they fell off soobin went crazy posting breakup songs ðŸ˜­ later that yr changmin had a rumor with a girl but I think it was the same girl that claimed soobin got her pregnant that made it up and who is keonhee? finding out soobin is fr gay was funny I didn't see that coming 

my aghase friend told me ab mark and Nancy I don't care ab either so I didn't know but I heard they still might b together 
old gay idc ab 
ohðŸ˜³? I do rmbr one of my deobi friends who was a big infinite fan talking ab that but I think she was talking ab how some of the members were weird to the gay member not enhypen weird but weird idk
I rmbr the yunho scandal he got kicked off kingdom mcing 
onew will burn 
not surprised I thought they did they same for ahyun 
and woahhhh what did she say ab him

      <p>-yess for seolha also she has friend in dreamcatcher who was really supportive but I forgot the details there was a forum were there was so much idol tea I miss it everyday
-i loved qsoob idk I think they were cute and soobin emo break up song made me like him like that's so funny ðŸ˜­keonhee is a gay guy from oneus and the tea is he recently went with park Hanbin to a THE BOYZ concert lmaoo
-im not familiar w infinite enough but the detail of the dispatch thing was the the two dated for 5 years and were an a list group and I think infinite fits it the best (it was 2016)
-soo many idols hiatus are for surgery purpose it's funny you can tell when their face mysteriously slightly changed when they come back
-The jun mom tea is crazy...she's been micro managing him since debut and even pushes ship w him w popular members and spread nasty rumors like c carats hateee her if I can find one article I'll link it</p>
