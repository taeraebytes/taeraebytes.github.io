 this shit isn't normal at all, and I've heard rumors about his alcohol problems for years so it isn't even new he also always hangs out with svt mingyu and svt get dooown w the alcohol, I also remember NCT 127 having a similar fridge condition...
People don't talk about it a lot and idk how he is rn but at one point Jackson Wang clearly has severe alcoholism/addiction issues, hope he got better</p>

      <p>oh that video was so crazy I thougjt the main fridge was it then he flipped to the compartment üò≠üò≠ I cant say I'm shocked especially with jungkook the entertainment industry is brutal and being in it from such a young age and that huge rise to fame plus the harassment and stalking he's endured it's really sad to see I hope he heals
