      <p>Here come the pessimistic hoes like their engagements are okay , theyre on par and better than other 5th gen groups no they arent gonna get 100K bc the members dont use it personally anymore . Idk what kinda growth people expect from zb1 but its crazy, theyre doing okay only thing I fault wakeone for is not shipping out albums early enough cause that caused zb1 to miss out on many music shows. Im always gonna be optimistic bc none of my favs ever reached the kinda success they have maybe just go back to ur old groups if ur not satisfied</p>
