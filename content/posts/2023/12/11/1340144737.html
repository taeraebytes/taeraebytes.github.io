As for solar, it’s not as clear cut but personally she gives me bi vibes but i couldn’t give you concrete evidence beyond her just being an ally and like small things that aren’t as clear. And for if they are together, im not a big shipper or anything but i just need to let y’all know that they’re attached at the HIP like they practically live together 😭 Solar has her own solo youtube channel but it’s essentially a duo youtube channel because Byul is always at her house so she just always ends up being in the videos and i think i remember at one point one of them remarked how Byul practically lived with Solar 😭 And idk they’re just always flirting with each other. like yeah fanservice but sometimes it’s to the point where it’s like 🤨but also all of mamamoo is super flirtatious with each other so idk.  i think there’s still a good chance they’re just really close friends but if they said they were dating i wouldn’t be surprised 🤷‍♀️",
