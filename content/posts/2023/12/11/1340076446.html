      <p>well not tea but let's stir up the pot...

don't you think that zerocolas and gyubrickers (idk their ship fandom) also act insane on those fancalls bc hao, kinda feeds into it? like if you compare hanbin answers he's not even doing all that, his answers are more normal meanwhile hao it's 2 seconds away from being gyuvin 2.0. for example, people attacked the op that asked the "is there a thing that you feel like you can't do without hanbin?" the question wasn't even bad, and they asked gyuvin the same question previously but the question took a whole new path when hao started talking about how his body is cold while hanbin body is warm and all that... hao please be serious.

meanwhile for gyubrick, yeah gyuvin doing too much but ricky also says insane things too... gyuvin takes the cake but it's not like ricky is innocent either.</p>

      <p>i feel like they know which type of fan theyre talking to ( shippers, gf stans, normal ones) and hao is a people pleaser and tries hard and perhaps go overboard to satisfy the fan‚Äôs needs in fansigns.. also hao always gets the brunt of haobin shippers (they lash out on him on bbl and some even send hate on wb if hes not interacting w hanbin ‚Äòproperly‚Äô) so maybe thats why 

i do agree some of his answers are unhinged but lately i feel like he looks not as enthusiastic as he used to be in fansigns?? idk everytime he talks to a shipper his face is giving ‚Äúlets just get this shit over with‚Äù but thats prolly just me</p>

      <p>anon maybe right because he's not like this before melting point era, idk what wakeone told him to because i feel something about haobin dynamic after bunch of zerocolas threatening to boycott if there's no haobin moment, now he answer those question with "you want me to answer with something like this right" and give them the most unhinged answerüò≠</p>

      <p>They also cut out bits they don‚Äôt like, like on do the re rn fansigns a zero cola asked hanbin what he would do if they dated hao and they were obvious expecting him to play into being jealous of them with hao or smth and he was just like you should have joking hao‚Äôs video call then, and in another one they asked him to post more photos of him and hao kn bubble and he said bubble is a personal space ( they then mistranslated it into the company won‚Äôt let him post hao, which going from the Paris selca he posted on his bubble isn‚Äôt the case) and there‚Äôs so many more examples where he doesn‚Äôt feed into their answers but you will never see it translated or make it into the main wb or twt pages because it doesn‚Äôt fit into the narrative they want</p>

      <p>also hao saying ‚Äúbing bing is mine‚Äù was literally lip reading which is not exactly reliable üò≠ and the video where he talked about hanbin being warm the op cut their voice when they were asking him so we don‚Äôt even know for sure what the questions he was answering, also a lot of people mentioned that he said ‚Äúin the car‚Äù and not ‚Äúbody‚Äù but i don‚Äôt speak chinese so idk‚Ä¶ either we shouldn‚Äôt just  trust people who are openly manipulating everything to fit their narrative 

they also created situation similar to what happened during kcon la with that poor girl who was accused of being an akgae and doxxed where they misheard somebody saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stand with hanbin‚Äù and decided to run with that narrative and were arguing with people (not even rosins) saying that it was not what that person said, but after a video from another angle was released and it was clear that the person was saying ‚Äústand with dr shim‚Äù they were silent‚Ä¶ like do you want people to hate your fave or what</p>
