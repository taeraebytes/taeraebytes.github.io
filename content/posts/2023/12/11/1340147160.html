      <p>About juns mom; Jun's uncle used to leave comments like "there's 2 can member in svt, one is bad, the other is good" and would push the wonhui ship that is popular in china I do feel bad for jun bcs his family clearly micro manages his whole life like when his drama released jun apologized which is weird and they're publicly embarrassing but ughh you need to cut ties atp...adding on to this jun is probably gay and it's like ..are you gonna marry a woman because your mom told you? Complicated bcs he's a victim but it affects so many people (esp Minghao)</p>
