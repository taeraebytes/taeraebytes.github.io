      <p>Some tea. Hao's never talks about his father and vice versa because his father is ashamed of his sexuality. Basically disowned him and his parents live seperately. A long time friend of Hao's mom shared it on weibo but it was an ambiguous post, kind of like a 'I feel so sorry for my friend that she and her son has to go through this in 2023'. When Hao started getting famous on BP his fans went digging and found his mom and his mom's friend. But the friend only had a few friends so they concluded it was about Hao.</p>
