      <p>c zerocolas arent really hao antis though they just dont care about him as an individual. it's not like they like hanbin more but bc of the language barrier zhang hao is the one constantly getting the short end of the stick</p>

      <p>That's because haobin are kpops first real CP, it's different than "ship" cp fans are explicitly fan of the relationship bw 2 celebrities and it's very normalized in china you'll have other celebrities sharing their favorite cps etc haobin have a huge proper fan base for their image as a couple crosins are desperately trying to stop it's growth but it's too late now
The Paris pic for example brought in tons of new people and crosins were mad and started spreading hate about Hanbin in the comments so the ship wouldn't grow in popularity, or I can remember two other instances of them doxxing shippers for false info that was then later proved true w audio recordings like it's wayy too late now they need to give it up, not only is haobin the top ship internationally, in china, in Korea and in Japan a lot of people genuinely believe they're together, they're a step above the average ship in kpop even in Korea and Japan (the average kpop ship would be like gyujin)the cp fans won't leave even if they both get married like they're dedicated dedicated it's best for both sides of the fandom to stop interacting</p>
