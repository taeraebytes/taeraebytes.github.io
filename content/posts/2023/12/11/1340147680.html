      <p>i know your anons hate taerae but i honestly think the whole gyurae thing is a bit they both do for the cameras because whenever the camera doesn't focus on them they are really affectionate and if gyuvin hated him so much he wouldn't constantly talk about how supportive taerae is of his singing etc. I really think it's just a thing both do for fun</p>
