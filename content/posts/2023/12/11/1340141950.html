      <p>tea. jungkook and chengxiao used to date. He started crushing on her during wjsn "secret" era and then chengxiao was on Law of the Jungle with jin, jin also had a crushed on her but jungkook didn't know and he'd tried to get close to chengxiao via jin. During one of BTS spring day encore Chengxiao was standing behind them and when the members noticed she was on screen they deliberately moved so that she would be on screen and u can see jungkook staring.

During Isac you can see him pass her a note but armies buried it but you can still find another video with that part in it on youtube, its a full cam of the whole arena with all the idols and u can see him approach her, they bow and he hands her something. They started dating late 2018 and even made a couple post, her posting a red heart and he posting a purple heart at the same time. Their couple brand was the acw and they always wore it. Same year Dispatch teased that jungkook was going to be exposed as the "new year couple" but ended up not doing so. BigHit paid them off and made some kind of deal with them. 

Sadly yuehua started giving her Chinese schedules so she went to china a lot while still promoting with wjsn, eventually she started acting and she's been in China ever since. They broke up sometime during that and that's when Jungkook started getting a bunch of tattoos and grew out his hair like a hobo. 

I'm too lazy to find all these videos but evidence is all there if u do look for it. yw have fun idk if they're still dating tho she went back to korea a few weeks mayb a monthish ago i forgot and that was when the dispatch vid of jungkook hugging someone in his apartment got leaked + she follows a bunch of k moots as jungkook and the actress in his Seven mv after it came out so do what u want with that info.</p>
