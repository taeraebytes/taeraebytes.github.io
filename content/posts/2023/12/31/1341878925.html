      <p>i am sorry but ricky can stand up for himself, 20 years old, like 5 years knowing gyuvin personally, even if it's difficult for him to express discomfort in KR he could just say it in english and Gyuvin could understand.</p>

      <p>He can yea but from a fans point of view it's probably annoying af if it were my bias I'd be pissed because it's also about his image as an idol. And also gyuvin kinda just does whatever he wants I think Ricky can stand up for himself too but some things just irk I guess

      <p>and the point still stands bc during BP ricky went and stood up for himself when mjx annoyed him and even if it's difficult for him to confront gyuvin he can just ignore him, he already does that with half of the members</p>
