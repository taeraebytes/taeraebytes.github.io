      <p>i'm surprised it's not talked about tho like not one person has really ended up spilling????? i'd never do it, partly bc i'm not into men anyway and idk if female idols do that but i probably wouldn't hook up with one regardless, but i feel like i wouldn't be able to hold it in since it's kinda crazy like even with an nda how have idols hooking up with fans not been more widely discussed since i know ppl must snitch about it to their friends in dms, word of mouth and such. ppl joke about ndas but you never see ppl actually take it seriously, ya know?</p>

      <p>Well groupies are known to stay quiet cuz why would they ruin further opportunities and they'd get treated like that judy girl who's an attempted groupie but was too loud. Thats seriously why like association to a celeb and dick will shut u upppp you can always tell who's a groupie tho when u go to a concert.

      <p>for the khh artists especially the groupies are so obvious they act like they dont care the whole time, are quite literally in a group and then leave through the back when the shows about to end, and thats if they are even in the crowd . my friend signed a nda for a big khh artist once (hint he may have done other promos before) ü§ê then she found out it was a orgy and left</p>

      <p>they used to be in a big company before lol, but she also left cause she had suspicion he was leaving and it was in fact his dusty friends that wanted to ehjsnseh i have 0 experience in that life plus im not really into fucking around like that no matter if its my fav but all i do know is , the closer you are to the touring company staff the better . actually being pretty is all it takes , im not gonna brag but if u have confidence go for it, i even got front row for bts when i was at the back just by flirting with staff djehen men are fucking easy just act ditzy like u dont know much about kpop . also lastly no matter what event u are just say ur a influencer for free drinks or to get into vip</p>
