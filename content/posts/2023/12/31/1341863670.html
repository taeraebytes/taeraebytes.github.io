      <p>riyangis are so stupid broðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ they said ricky kfans are useless, stupid etc. if it weren't for them the issue wouldn't be trending on Pann TheQoo and Instiz. tbh, itâ€™s understandable if some fans are uncomfortable with gyu. that's also why yjâ€™s cfans always tell yj to stay away from him. theyâ€™re so fucked up. they will be jw 2.0</p>
