      <p>hao the jihyo, hanbin the nayeon and taerae the jeongyeon.

those twice-zb1 parallels are sickening. 

Ricky is the tzuyu obviously.</p>

      <p>taerae as jeongyeon is nasty work tbh taerae tops all of twice main vocal line when they were rookies ... hao is nayeon hanbin is jeongyeon and if we HAVE to taerae is jihyo bye</p>

      <p>i was going off who gets more lines and jihyo gets more like hao and jeongyeon is almost equal to jihyo in talent hanbin rlly doesn't fit in since the 3 of them are main vocals with different areas of expertise

      <p>No because jihyo doesn't have just vocals she is a great dancer and most of all, a very passionate performer so she fits Hao way more imo
I also agree w Hanbin nayeon because he acts as a main vocal as those traditional visual, is cute, great performer
Taerae as Jeongyeon
Gunwook to me is Mina actually
Ricky is Tzuyu
Jiwoong Sana (sorry Sana but they have similar roles)
Yujin Momo
Gyuvin Dahyun
Matthew and Chae
Yes I got tired of explaining after 2 members what about it but it's not just about skills but the role they play in the group</p>

      <p>Yeah most wannables did not fuck with Daniel back then, mostly because of his fans. actually Iâ€™m pretty sure I still got stuff saved from the gossip forums in allkpop with his fans cursing ppl out (imma have to go through my storage in a bit). his fall is kinda funny tho because most ppl actually rooted for him during pd101 like kfans and ifans both came to the agreement that he was needed in the grp and we were all hyping him up for his talent and got excited that he was placing high. I think him getting 1st instead of jihoon and no one rlly fucking with the lineup the day of the finale kinda threw ppl off and then debut era was even worse and most of us just started despising him ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>People still hate him to this day, most people actively prefer by a looot Zhang Hao (a very gay, very Chinese man) than Daniel (ugly and untalented and took the spot from jihoon) might not seem like a big thing to you but if you lurk on kspaces a lot yk how crazy that is LMAO people really hate his ass</p>

      <p>Yes he was also one of the W1 members that got caught on that leaked audio talking shit abt filo fans, also got caught making jihyo take out his trash from his apartment, also knows how crazy his fans were and encouraged the behavior, also caught the celebrity disease once he got all the love from ahjummas</p>
