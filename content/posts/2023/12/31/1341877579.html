      <p>More Tea (and I’m not even kidding like I keep tabs on these idols and it’s funny because now that 3rd gen has died down everything has become so obvious)

- Somi and taeyong messed with each other around late 2020/21 now their just in an on and off relationship but I think their done for good

- Red velvet seulgi’s cousin (the one that you always see her hanging out with on IG) dislikes Irene she’s disliked her since even before the scandal with the stylist 

- Wjsn Seola is lesbian and has a gf they’ve been together since she was a rookie in wjsn (they went to the same all girl school together)

- Twice Tzuyu mom seems to dislike sana. She’s been caught numerous times liking anti sana post from weird fans 

- KD sued his old company (MMO ent now merged with another company and turned into wakeone) and guess what? it came back to bite him in his ass 3 years later. Bro doesn’t even get as much tv work as he used two because his career his falling..the AAA Mc thing was one of the main things he had this year. He was better off just aging terribly and start harassing the media with variety work like suju members did but even then he doesn’t have the personality for all of that. He also signed gfriend yuju to his company because they were messing around for a bit (bro has a thing for main vocals)</p>
