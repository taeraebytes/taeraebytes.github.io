      <p>hao the jihyo, hanbin the nayeon and taerae the jeongyeon.

those twice-zb1 parallels are sickening. 

Ricky is the tzuyu obviously.</p>

      <p>taerae as jeongyeon is nasty work tbh taerae tops all of twice main vocal line when they were rookies ... hao is nayeon hanbin is jeongyeon and if we HAVE to taerae is jihyo bye</p>

      <p>i was going off who gets more lines and jihyo gets more like hao and jeongyeon is almost equal to jihyo in talent hanbin rlly doesn't fit in since the 3 of them are main vocals with different areas of expertise

      <p>No because jihyo doesn't have just vocals she is a great dancer and most of all, a very passionate performer so she fits Hao way more imo
I also agree w Hanbin nayeon because he acts as a main vocal as those traditional visual, is cute, great performer
Taerae as Jeongyeon
Gunwook to me is Mina actually
Ricky is Tzuyu
Jiwoong Sana (sorry Sana but they have similar roles)
Yujin Momo
Gyuvin Dahyun
Matthew and Chae
Yes I got tired of explaining after 2 members what about it but it's not just about skills but the role they play in the group</p>
