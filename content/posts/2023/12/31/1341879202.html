      <p>i am sorry but ricky can stand up for himself, 20 years old, like 5 years knowing gyuvin personally, even if it's difficult for him to express discomfort in KR he could just say it in english and Gyuvin could understand.</p>

      <p>He can yea but from a fans point of view it's probably annoying af if it were my bias I'd be pissed because it's also about his image as an idol. And also gyuvin kinda just does whatever he wants I think Ricky can stand up for himself too but some things just irk I guess

      <p>and the point still stands bc during BP ricky went and stood up for himself when mjx annoyed him and even if it's difficult for him to confront gyuvin he can just ignore him, he already does that with half of the members</p>

      <p>weren’t haorae jokingly beefing with each other in that one ig grp live because they didn’t hang out during chuseok😭 ricky mentioned eating haidilao with hao during chuseok, then taerae was like “how could you not invite us to eat haidilao with you!” and hao replied with “you went to lotte world (without us)!”, taerae said “i went back to the dorms but you weren’t there” 

ijbol i have a feeling they want to hang out together outside of the dorms/schedules but don’t know how to invite the other. at least they’re growing closer so hopefully soon🤞 hao went out with matt last night and mentioned in a fansign that he wants to go out with ricky outside of schedules, feels like he wants to hang out 1-on-1 with the members for fun when they’re less busy but since he’s an introvert he probably tires easily so the chance doesn’t come by often</p>
