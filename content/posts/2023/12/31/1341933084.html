      <p>finally a good fucking question I honestly don't believe the giselle and hyunsik rumors something deeeeep in my soul tells me it's a gidle member people won't gaf if its soyeon and miyeons making a name for herself if feel bad if it were here. As for the 2nd gen turned actor it could be im siwan too but I also feel like it might not actually be a 4th gen female idol and a 2ng gen idol actor regardless DISPATCH DROP THAT SHIT RIGHT NOW
