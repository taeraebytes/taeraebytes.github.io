      <p>One day we gotta talk about how gw looking and carrying himself more mature than his age results in his actions being perceived worse than if he were a 5 ft 9 twiggy flower boy like it's not his problem a flash of midriff on him got fans and weirdos alike in a tizzy. like it's been said, this is part of his job, his intentions arent any worse or more perverted than any other idolsllmsmsk. (As if young adults just existing or doing their jobs while being hot and manly/womanly is some kind of notable sexual affront. And this judgement is even more apparent with women, esp those who are well endowed.)</p>

      <p>Honestly like I'm a little shocked at the outrage because yes he is young but the anger is insane and never out of a place of concern that these people try to mask it as and considering this is a norm in kpop like PUHLEASEðŸ˜­  it's part of his job it was literally requested to the point he himself got annoyed so now what. Accusing him of perverted intentions like get the fuck out of my face he hasn't done shit out of the norm
