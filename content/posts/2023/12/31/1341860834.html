      <p>riyangis are so stupid bro😭😭 they said ricky kfans are useless, stupid etc. if it weren't for them the issue wouldn't be trending on Pann TheQoo and Instiz. tbh, it’s understandable if some fans are uncomfortable with gyu. that's also why yj’s cfans always tell yj to stay away from him. they’re so fucked up. they will be jw 2.0</p>
