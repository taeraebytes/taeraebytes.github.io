taerae - taeil (main vocal that no one really cares about im sorry)
ricky - winwin (known for being quiet [even though winwin was only quiet in 127 really], can't really sing but at least they're serving face. winwin is still talented at dancing though idk)
gyuvin - yangyang? idfk i feel like gyuvin is too crazy for anyone in these comparisons
gunwook - highkey too good for any of the nct members like none of the like 2 people who can actually rap in nct can sing and the personalities aren't similar either i don't wanna compare him to any of these high school dropouts
