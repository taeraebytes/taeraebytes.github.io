      <p>i am sorry but ricky can stand up for himself, 20 years old, like 5 years knowing gyuvin personally, even if it's difficult for him to express discomfort in KR he could just say it in english and Gyuvin could understand.</p>

      <p>He can yea but from a fans point of view it's probably annoying af if it were my bias I'd be pissed because it's also about his image as an idol. And also gyuvin kinda just does whatever he wants I think Ricky can stand up for himself too but some things just irk I guess

      <p>and the point still stands bc during BP ricky went and stood up for himself when mjx annoyed him and even if it's difficult for him to confront gyuvin he can just ignore him, he already does that with half of the members</p>

      <p>I dont think matthew and taerae are on and off matthew just doesnt express himself to taerae as loud as taerae does, and it seems off cause matthew is usually the very open one with members . But the other members kinda want him to have that loud cutie vibe esp gyuvin gunwook with taerae he is defo more chilled</p>

jiwoong - hanbin, mtw(?), gyuvin, yujin
hanbin - get along well with everyone, close to hao, mtw, gyub
hao - hanbin, taerae
matt - get along well with everyone, close to hanbin, jiwoong (?), taerae, gyuvin, gunwook
taerae - mtw, hao, gyuvin
ricky - gyuvin
gyuvin - get along well with everyone, close to hb, gunwook, mtw, ricky, yujin
gunwook - gyuvin, matthew, yujin(?)
yujin - jiwoong, gyuvin, gunwook(?)</p>

      <p>I know this is ur opinion but I feel like what I think is different heres mine 
 
jiwoong: hanbin (comfortable coworkers) yujin (simply bcuz he's maknae, slightly attempts to be close) jiwoong has the worst relationships in the group he can very visibly annoy members 

zhanghao: hes trickier ngl taerae (newer friends very cute to me) hanbin (duh)  gyuwook (favorite dongsaengs I'm gonna say it's a relationship because he does enjoy being around them and he's roommates w gunwook) Ricky (just have that mutual respect and comfortability as the only Chinese members they might get closer but rn they're not)

hanbin: he's generally very kind and tries to build relationships as the leader. He's close to Zhanghao gyuvin matthew he adores gunwook and yujin(?) coworkers with jiwoong and Ricky (he's trying to get closer to him) roommates w taerae ppl say they hang tgthr in the dorms I think and we obv cant see that

Matthew: jiwoong and him were fake af and they're not "close" anymore, hanbin (close their relationship is real!!!), zhanghao (duh), gunwook spends a lot of time with him adores him etc gyuvin spends time with him as well, taerae (on and off irdk)

Taerae: on and off w matthrw, gyuvin to him only it's getting reciprocated as of late, hao a recent thing but a good friendship, hanbin is his roommate so maybe smths there idk 

Ricky: gyuvin, yujin, gunwook I feel like we don't see much of the last two but besides gyuvin he talks to them the most, hanbin is TRYING to get close and it's a recent thing

Gyuvin: pretty much everyone besides jiwoong and taerae him and Matthew are a bit more surface level hao as well 

Gunwook: adores and looks up to hanbin they practice and talk a lot, roommates with hao and they match the most in comfortability; adoration, spends a lot of time w matthew, gyuvin his bff, yujin and him are pretty close they spend a lot of time tgthr and Ricky he's chill with it's more of a trio thing 

Yujin: it's questionable how close he is with jiwoong, then gyuvin duh, close with gunwook, I think he's decently close to Ricky again we just don't see a lot and I don't much else ab yj.

My bad this is very long zb1 dynamics are just talked about soooo much here and I know I changed the formatting a bunch oopsie

      <p>I love seeing jebewon's friendships from other people's eyes and here's mine

Jiwoong: comfortable with hanbin, babies yujin a lot, these days he seems like he is trying to be close to gyuvin. He and matthew definitely fought or something because there were period of time they didn't interact at all but they are interacting again now

Hao: close with hanbin, comfortable with gyuvin and gunwook. I actually never really realized haorae's dynamics? And he don't fuck with jiwoong

Hanbin: close with hao, matthew, gyuvin, comfortable with everyone else. Also these days he seems closer to ricky and it's adorable (especially the trio cats meowing)

Matthew: close with hanbin, gyuvin, gunwook, comfortable with hao and taerae, and i already mentioned about ppusamz

Taerae: comfortable with matthew, likes gyuvin although onesided, i'm also curious about his closeness with hanbin i don't hear much about their rooming stories, or maybe it's because shimkongz are always loud and gunhao talked about their rooming tmi or mentioning each other in lives pretty often

Ricky: close with gyuvin, comfortable with gunwook and hanbin (recently). I don't really see him being close to yujin too. He also don't fuck with jiwoong

Gyuvin: obsessed with ricky, close with hao, hanbin, matthew, gunwook, yujin, comfortable with the rest ig

Gunwook: close with matthew, gyuvin, yujin, comfortable with hao, hanbin, ricky. I used to think maknaez aren't really close, but gunwook started saying he gonna eat/play with yujin and it's adorable. Also he is coworkers with jiwoong because he kept calling jiwoong with hyungnim

Yujin: close with gyuvin, gunwook, comfortable with hanbin, he used to put up with jiwoong but he started caring about him less</p>
