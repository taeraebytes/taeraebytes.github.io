      <p>zb1 as nct except despite being an nctzen for 3 years i don't actually know shit about nct
i kinda gave up on jisung and you can tell i was mostly a 127zen

jiwoong - yuta
hao - haechan ?? in the way their fans think they're twink singing jesus
hanbin - ten (bc of the dancing + vocals) or doyoung (uptight)
matthew - mark (endearing, just says shit occasionally but in very different ways)
taerae - taeil (main vocal that no one really cares about im sorry)
ricky - winwin (known for being quiet [even though winwin was only quiet in 127 really], can't really sing but at least they're serving face. winwin is still talented at dancing though idk)
gyuvin - yangyang? idfk i feel like gyuvin is too crazy for anyone in these comparisons
gunwook - highkey too good for any of the nct members like none of the like 2 people who can actually rap in nct can sing and the personalities aren't similar either i don't wanna compare him to any of these high school dropouts
yujin - jisung (lazy comparison it's just the main dancer maknae meal)</p>

ok haechan hao hmmm a little bit I find haechan too annoying tho 

hanbin is a less bitchy doyoung to me ten and him are way diff but talent wise they're closer 

I can see Matthew mark 

üò≠üò≠üò≠ taeraes personality reminds me of jungwoo if I didn't hate his guts 

Winwin was my former king and I'd give him Ricky too 

Gyuvin and yangx2 DEFINITELY 

Periodddddd

Yea I can see the connection with jisung yujin
