      <p>no those park hanbin rumors were the fakest rumors i've ever seen like i am 100% sure they're not real ðŸ˜­ like there's a lot of stuff i can say about it but i don't wanna write an essay so i'll just say that it's literally impossible for that screenshot to be true because facebook *did not* look like that back then
and the colorist part was just someone on twt who can't actually translate for shit like that part wasn't even a part of the original rumors 

ppl seriously just jumped on him bc they were bored like even the kside ignored this after like 1 day and you know that kfans take misogyny like 1000x more seriously than ifans</p>
