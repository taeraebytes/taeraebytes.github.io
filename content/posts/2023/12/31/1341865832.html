      <p>More tea: back in broduce there were rumors that some of the trainees were fawking on each other in kforums but that year the season was just sooooo big like every website was clogged of content  and ads relating to broduce s2 so ppl just assumed it was troll bait or just never came across it but whatâ€™s crazy is the next season right after it (produce 48) mnet had put in a rule that the trainees couldnâ€™t have any physical contact with each other so I knew op wasnâ€™t lying</p>
