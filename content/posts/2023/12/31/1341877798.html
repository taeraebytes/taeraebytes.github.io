      <p>hao the jihyo, hanbin the nayeon and taerae the jeongyeon.

those twice-zb1 parallels are sickening. 

Ricky is the tzuyu obviously.</p>

      <p>taerae as jeongyeon is nasty work tbh taerae tops all of twice main vocal line when they were rookies ... hao is nayeon hanbin is jeongyeon and if we HAVE to taerae is jihyo bye</p>

      <p>i was going off who gets more lines and jihyo gets more like hao and jeongyeon is almost equal to jihyo in talent hanbin rlly doesn't fit in since the 3 of them are main vocals with different areas of expertise

      <p>No because jihyo doesn't have just vocals she is a great dancer and most of all, a very passionate performer so she fits Hao way more imo
I also agree w Hanbin nayeon because he acts as a main vocal as those traditional visual, is cute, great performer
Taerae as Jeongyeon
Gunwook to me is Mina actually
Ricky is Tzuyu
Jiwoong Sana (sorry Sana but they have similar roles)
Yujin Momo
Gyuvin Dahyun
Matthew and Chae
Yes I got tired of explaining after 2 members what about it but it's not just about skills but the role they play in the group</p>

      <p>Minhee could be Ricky instead because they're both blondes with nice voices but I put him as hao because they're both so quirky and spontaneous. Junho and Hao look similar.

Jiwoong as Hangyul. Their voices sound similar and idk actually Hangyul may be the main dancer but he's not the best dancer. Their builds and the way they move is similar.

Wooseok as Ricky, both have that feline face structure, are singers, and okay at dancing but kinda stiff.

Gyuvin as Dongpyo. They're the most talkative and free-spirited, getting into controversies.

Eunsang is just known as being cute and kinda weird (but in a strictly cute way) and has a soft voice.

Hanbin as Seungyoun because they both have a very intense look on their face when they perform except Hanbin doesn't rap. The all-rounderness is more gunwook.

Seungwoo Taerae mebos</p>

      <p>I get what u mean with minhee and hao but they're like opposite kinds of quirky I guess and junho... please don't disrespect hao

I liked hangyul so that's a diss he wasn't the best but miles better and he had a huskier tone but it was easy on the ears

I feel like wooseok suits hao more ngl 

ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… a little bittt 

Eunsang would be yujin and Matthew mixed I think 

Yea seungyouns allrounderness goes to gunwook but ig what u mean w the face and he was a good hyung 

don't know what mebos is
