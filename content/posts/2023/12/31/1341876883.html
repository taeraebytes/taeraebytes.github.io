      <p>On the subreddit Kpop_Uncensored, theres a post asking “which groups would you remove a member from?” And someone commented this: 

“The Boyz(11 -> 7) Juyeon, Hyunjae, New, Eric, Sunwoo, Younghoon, Kevin. I truly believe with 7 members (doesn’t necessarily have to be these 7, some combination) TBZ would be significantly more popular among international fans.

ZB1 (9 -> 6) Zhang Hao, Sung Hanbin, Matthew, Ricky, Taerae, JiwoongORGunwook. Gunwook is more versatile and adds more but I think Jiwoong balances the group out better/improves variety dynamics more.. So I guess  I would put up Jiwoong. Maknae Ricky, that would be kinda something.”</p>

      <p>I'm sorry kpop Reddit is for low iq bastards WHAT😭😭😭 leaving changmin out who's main dancer and a lead vocalist is crazy jacob honestly has the talent of a main vocal but he's under utilized I love the group but adding Eric and younghoon who are leads at best is crazy I mean Eric I guess for international fame idk in tbzs case you can't cut it down to 7 that's taking away a lot of charm and for zb1 choosing jiwoong over gunwook who's wildly unpopular compared to him overseas 😭 and jiwoong improving dynamics yea please keep Reddit shit on Reddit
