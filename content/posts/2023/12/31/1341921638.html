      <p>i do think taerae and matthew are genuinely close though? I doubt taerae would go out of his way to write a whole song or cry in front of the cameras if it was some made up friendship; also matthew always takes care of taerae in a way he doesn't really do any of the others like helping him in every costume, fixing his hair, complimenting him i do think they are genuinely close</p>
