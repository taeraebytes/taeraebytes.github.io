      <p>Lisa BP is dating nepo baby white rich boy Frederic arnault. Ppl tried saying they were friends but it’s pretty obvious their dating atp since they’re always together also one of my friends who was outside a restaurant while he was with her at Paris for a Celine show confirmed that they were on a date. I don’t blame her tho this guy has a shit ton of money his dad net worth is 201.7 billion</p>
