      <p>apparently korea doesn't use korean age but the age system is still based off of the age you turn that year so gunwook is actually an adult i'm like actually worried about how the 40 year old noonas are going to act now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>yea they abolished it but people in the entertainment industry still use it. Im worried too it feels like it's stunting him coming into himself but also he hasn't done anything insane a lot of it is fake outrage coupled with actual concern. Like everyone forgets it's also his job to make his fans happy hope he gains a younger fanbase
