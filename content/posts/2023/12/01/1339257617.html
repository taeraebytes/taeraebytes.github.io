      <p>it kinda pisses me off how much some members play out being poor even tho none of them are poor. like gyuvin bragging about how he uses ricky's card to pay for his food as if he doesn't come from generational wealth and in reality probably more rich than ricky. but hao is the most annoying with this bc he always plays it up for pity, talking about how he couldn't afford a ticket to the amusement park while showing the picture of him next to his mother ducked in high brand designer clothes. he comes from rich area and used to swap designer bags every week in university, not to mention it takes some good money to afford to even learn a classical instrument. violin lessons cost $40-100 per hour. it's one of the most expensive instruments to learn. so for him to get to the level he's rn would've taken millions of dollars. i hate it. they're all upper middle class to high class kids cosplaying poverty ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I don't think anyone's acted poor when they weren't like hao has other stories I'm p sure but idk I don't pay close enough attention it would b weird if he was playing up but the province hes from is actually a poorer one and gyuvin just acts like ur typical rich kid
