      <p>ricky is actually one of the more natural members because the only thing he has done is chin filler. he has T bone structure of a god so when he has make up on + lenses he looks like an ai and that what makes people think he has his face done. it's tough being pretty ðŸ˜­ yet hanbin who had his whole face rebuild is having the time of his life hiding in the background because even after all that work he still looks like some normal dude</p>

      <p>It's because Ricky's features are sharp and they get even sharper with the makeup which he doesn't look the best in imo he's the prettiest when he's more rounded out he rlly does look ai w it tho

      <p>Half agree with the hanbin one, if you look at childhood pics he looks very similar I think heâ€™s just had his nose and jaw (possibly) done. Itâ€™s kinda hard to tell with him because in the teenage years where you would compare usually he lost a shit ton of weight since then. I wouldnâ€™t normally add input but he said he lost 30kgs and as someone who lost 26kg myself I had people say it looked like I had worked done even though I had nothing. Although I agree with the normal dude sentiment, if he has/hasnâ€™t had work done his face fits the beauty standard but not in the way where he has sharp sticking features. The only way I can explain it is he definitely has an actor face over an idol face</p>

      <p>He definitely got his nose done the tip is raised high and I think they went a little too skinny on the bridge but other than that he has a pretty nice nose job I think his eyes as well but with his weight loss a lot of that counters in and yea he has like a tv face

      <p>hanbin surgeries if you guys are curious 


two rhinoplasties both done predebut
cheekbone reduction 
chin implant 
lip lift
bottom lip filler
blepharoplasty epicanthoplasty and other eye related surgeries and procedures 

i think thatâ€™s it. thereâ€™s scars on his face if you look closely and you can tell he has had surgery hnder harsh lighting or if you are seasoned in spotting things but it doesnâ€™t look as obvious as rickyâ€™s may be. he looks better.</p>

      <p>Tbh Iâ€™m someone who really doesnâ€™t gaf if any idol has had ps like god knows that if all of us had easy access to it most of us probably would want to change a thing or two about ourselves so good for him ig. I wonder how he paid for it tho considering his company is broke and he doesnâ€™t seem to come from serious money like shimkongz ?</p>
