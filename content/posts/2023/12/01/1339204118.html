      <p>they kind of are if you consider who has more fans riize doesn't have a strong core fandom they have the highest charting bg song but with talk saxy flopping and the scandals and removing a member ehhhhhh they're still big tho zb1 lost a lot but they still have more fans as of rn

      <p>i think riize and zb1 are kinda equal rn with zb1 having the bigger fanbase but riize having more gp recognition but i feel like riize is going to grow bigger than zb1 soon. saying this as a zerose. their mama stages got more attention than zb1 despite zb1 having more budget (and being more interesting imo ðŸ˜ª)</p>

      <p>zeroses are notorious for not watching anything on youtube tho ðŸ’€ we always post the entire performance on twt not just on one acc but several accs, even regular content we just want the clips on twt. it's so bad we made a jpeg template in bright red that says dont post the mv on twitter because we would and wouldn't watch it on yt ðŸ˜­</p>
