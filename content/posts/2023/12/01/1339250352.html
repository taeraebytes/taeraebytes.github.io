      <p>ricky is actually one of the more natural members because the only thing he has done is chin filler. he has T bone structure of a god so when he has make up on + lenses he looks like an ai and that what makes people think he has his face done. it's tough being pretty ðŸ˜­ yet hanbin who had his whole face rebuild is having the time of his life hiding in the background because even after all that work he still looks like some normal dude</p>

      <p>It's because Ricky's features are sharp and they get even sharper with the makeup which he doesn't look the best in imo he's the prettiest when he's more rounded out he rlly does look ai w it tho

      <p>Half agree with the hanbin one, if you look at childhood pics he looks very similar I think heâ€™s just had his nose and jaw (possibly) done. Itâ€™s kinda hard to tell with him because in the teenage years where you would compare usually he lost a shit ton of weight since then. I wouldnâ€™t normally add input but he said he lost 30kgs and as someone who lost 26kg myself I had people say it looked like I had worked done even though I had nothing. Although I agree with the normal dude sentiment, if he has/hasnâ€™t had work done his face fits the beauty standard but not in the way where he has sharp sticking features. The only way I can explain it is he definitely has an actor face over an idol face</p>

      <p>He definitely got his nose done the tip is raised high and I think they went a little too skinny on the bridge but other than that he has a pretty nice nose job I think his eyes as well but with his weight loss a lot of that counters in and yea he has like a tv face

      <p>hanbin surgeries if you guys are curious 


two rhinoplasties both done predebut
cheekbone reduction 
chin implant 
lip lift
bottom lip filler
blepharoplasty epicanthoplasty and other eye related surgeries and procedures 

i think thatâ€™s it. thereâ€™s scars on his face if you look closely and you can tell he has had surgery hnder harsh lighting or if you are seasoned in spotting things but it doesnâ€™t look as obvious as rickyâ€™s may be. he looks better.</p>

      <p>gyuvins had a chin implant I believe there's scarring on his chin I've seen ppl say he had his tip raised but I'm not the best at clocking this stuff and for maknaez uhhh I think but it's so so common to get minimal procedures done so who knows

      <p>anon none of them are natural. yujin has double eyelids. gyuvin has filler in chin, nose and possibly a bit in the lips. but yeah maknaes (including ricky) are more natural compared to hanbin. hanbin has the most done by far</p>

      <p>what are ur definitions of natural? to me they're natural as long as they haven't gone under anesthesia or anything invasive like removing or creating something completely new. One can be natural and have fillers because it can dissolve same with botox.

I mean would u say braces makes ur not natural? Because its straightening ur crooked ass teeth and correcting ur mouth breathing bite. So yeah that's why i think botox, fillers, braces doesn't make u not natural.</p>
