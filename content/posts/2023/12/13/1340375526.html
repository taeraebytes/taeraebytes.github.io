      <p>Tbh I just think they havenâ€™t been allowed to film it, hanbin mentioned in a fansign during in bloom that he wanted to try the hood me tight challenges but that it might be hard to because too much â€˜contentâ€™ is being uploaded. Even now his cover went viral but itâ€™s not even an actual tiktok he did it in bubble live so itâ€™s clear that the company is just simply not letting some of them use jt</p>

      <p>riize are doing a double song w a Japanese release probably gonna try to target that market simultaneously which is gonna tank them and they're probably not gonna release a song like gag zb1s socmed team isn't sabotaging them just stunting any fame they could get from there
