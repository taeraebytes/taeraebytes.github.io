      <p>zhang haoâ€™s never had a chin implant thoâ€¦? if u look at predebut pics he still looks the same. plus he was poor af where would he even get the money ðŸ’€ i wore braces and i can confirm my chin looks like that now, pretty sure if u think his chin looks different itâ€™s because he wore braces ðŸ˜­</p>
