this is second time he posted the pic without ricky's consent. shipper said this is funny as if they didn't care about ricky's feeling. especially we know ricky is insecure about his image A LOT. and as a person who claimed himself as ricky's best friend, he seemed didn't know ricky that well. at least, try to respect him. i also have a close friend, we joke a lot, but we know each boundary. it feels like gyuvin just want to fed shipper's delution.</p>
