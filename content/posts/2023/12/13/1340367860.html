      <p>different anon but there was a fansign pic from a few days/weeks (?) ago that got ratioed quite a bit on the k-side and all the quotes were comments of concern, asking him to eat more etc and i agree bc there was something about the way his head/neck looked like they looked reallyyyyyy skinny in a way that didn't match his body idk how to explain it but yeah. it wasn't like a typical fansite pic in that it was whitewashed, filtered or anything, it looked more like a fan who wasn't a fansite took it on their phone or a good quality camera, so i doubt his features were edited (though idk where the original tweet/pic is so i can't link it soz). i think he's pretty rough on himself in that regard it makes me sad</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s sad to say but speaking from experience someone who looses an extreme amount of weight ( he lost 30kg) often find it hard to not get stuck in the mindset of needing to be perfect/ stay thin. I think if you actually watch him in their content especially when they are eating itâ€™s very obvious heâ€™s careful around food and I guess coming from loosing that much weight to being in an industry that glorifies certain body types doesnâ€™t help</p>

      <p>also since he lost sm, his current weight is prob significantly lower than his set point so itâ€™s prob sm harder to maintain than someone who was naturally thin bc his body literally gain back to where its comfortable. 

i think he can sort of correct this if he starts bulking and focuses on weightlifting/muscle hypertrophy but he seems to always want to do cardio which is actually counterproductive ðŸ˜­ but this process takes time and itâ€™s pretty hard, esp given heâ€™s in the spotlight 24/7</p>

      <p>Ive seen the way he talks ab good sometimes it's concerning I hope he learns what's best for his body food and training wise I'm sure his fans would get upset if he expressed any wish of bulking up
