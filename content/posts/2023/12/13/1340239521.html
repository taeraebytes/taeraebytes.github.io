      <p>riize stans thinking they're already so big and all that and it's funny because none of their music have made enough noise for any of those accomplishments to he attributed to it. Everything has been bought for them because sm will go all in on a group after the last has failed and the cycle repeats. And they definitely ride on the coattails of nct because the music style is so similar.</p>

      <p>Maybe because get a guitar going viral was a chance thing it was good marketing a unique dance move and an easy song to listen to

      <p>i think they’re taking a diff creative path bc gag sounds very different tbh and it blew up in a way that nct hasn’t rly. also the only noise music they have is siren tbh, i wouldn’t categorize talk saxy or gag as noise. also based off the vibes of the members, and what anton likes to arrange/compose i wonder if they might have like a boy band/indie sound</p>
