<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/ikGgYiu7YJM?feature=shared">https://youtube.com/shorts/ikGgYiu7YJM?feature=shared</a> ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ the way gyuvin at the beginning exposed jiwoongs ass. gyuvin was like "us four (gv, gw, mt, rk) were in the room with yujin while ricky showed us..." he didnt mention jw at all. this makes me believe that maknae line + matthew hang out in the dorms alot. hao, hanbin and taerae are most of the times in their own room just chilling. expect gyuvin to always slip on things like that ðŸ˜‚. one of the maknaes exposed jw before too when they counted who was (except the ones that were live on swf2) watching it at home, the only member they didnt mention was jw</p>
