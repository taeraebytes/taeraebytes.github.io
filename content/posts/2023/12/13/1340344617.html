      <p>Thereâ€™s no proof staff orders the gifts for them?? it doesnâ€™t make sense if you look at some of the gifts from past lives idk why people are saying that in the tweet I just thought Hao was not being serious in the live to make it seem like the gift wasnâ€™t from him? If you look through the qrts itâ€™s full of annoying woonghao stans and some rosins being angry ðŸ˜­ and I saw someone mention that Hanbin said he ordered his gift online? so idk if this is true people shouldnâ€™t take this so seriously and like itâ€™s a fact</p>
