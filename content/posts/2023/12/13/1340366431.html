      <p>different anon but there was a fansign pic from a few days/weeks (?) ago that got ratioed quite a bit on the k-side and all the quotes were comments of concern, asking him to eat more etc and i agree bc there was something about the way his head/neck looked like they looked reallyyyyyy skinny in a way that didn't match his body idk how to explain it but yeah. it wasn't like a typical fansite pic in that it was whitewashed, filtered or anything, it looked more like a fan who wasn't a fansite took it on their phone or a good quality camera, so i doubt his features were edited (though idk where the original tweet/pic is so i can't link it soz). i think he's pretty rough on himself in that regard it makes me sad</p>
