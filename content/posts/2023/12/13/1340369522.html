      <p>zhang hao’s never had a chin implant tho…? if u look at predebut pics he still looks the same. plus he was poor af where would he even get the money 💀 i wore braces and i can confirm my chin looks like that now, pretty sure if u think his chin looks different it’s because he wore braces 😭</p>
