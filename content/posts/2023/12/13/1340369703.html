      <p>Tbh I just think they haven’t been allowed to film it, hanbin mentioned in a fansign during in bloom that he wanted to try the hood me tight challenges but that it might be hard to because too much ‘content’ is being uploaded. Even now his cover went viral but it’s not even an actual tiktok he did it in bubble live so it’s clear that the company is just simply not letting some of them use jt</p>
