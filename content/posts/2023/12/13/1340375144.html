      <p>zhang hao’s never had a chin implant tho…? if u look at predebut pics he still looks the same. plus he was poor af where would he even get the money 💀 i wore braces and i can confirm my chin looks like that now, pretty sure if u think his chin looks different it’s because he wore braces 😭</p>

      <p>No the implant is there it just hasn't made a drastic change all yuehua trainee/idols get shit done to their chin and the company probably provided plz let's not go back to discussing his finance his braces helped with his jaw not his chin I've had them too

      <p>it’s an implant babe his chin completely changed shape braces don’t do that shit and it’s not filler bc u can clearly see the outline of the implant since it’s not properly blended into his jawline. but you can keep denying it 🤷‍♀️ won’t change the fact he got it done</p>
