      <p>wait idk copying others tattoos is morally wrong I thought it's not a big deal since that person is a fan who just wanted to follow what their idols did (like u know when fans buy the same clothes as their favs)</p>

      <p>afaik hanbin crafted that sun moon and star himself, as in its not just a saying in a font like his other tatoo or even matthews hmc tattoo. as someone who does creative stuff id be pissed too if someone were to copy what i personally made for myself let alone a permanent tattoo. buying the same clothes is nothing</p>

      <p>Copying their tattoos is just weird like what is the point of matching something probably intimate to them ew
