      <p>I think the interview is still up on kpopalypse you can search it up "eric interview" it was just him being a middle school douchebag your avg American bullying teasing it caused the interviewee you know some self esteem issues and all that but I don't think it was anything too far like he shouldn't have done that but he was a kid he was just dumb af but I believe it
