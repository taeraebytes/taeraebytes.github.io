      <p>My vision of zb1 
Jiwoong straight bicurious former fuckboy now wants to settle down, only dates super hot girls
Hao gay mostly hooks up but commits one ce he gets a good bf
Hanbin gay mostly hooks up in college no serious relationships yet might get in a lavender marriage 
Taerae straight or gay guy that loves straight guys and will get in a lavender marriage, virgin loser
Matthew straight, relationship virgin and virgin loser in general as said by Gyuvin
Ricky bi w a female preference, serial dater, commitment issues, always in toxic relationships
Gyuvin; falls in love every 2 weeks and thinks each girl is the love of his life, doesn't think promise rings are cringy, if he weren't an idol hed propose after 2 months
Gunwook; similar to Gyuvin but less christian he gets super happy during the texting period and always somehow gets in situationships, love bombing CEO but he doesn't do it on purpose, loved girls that look like karina
Yujin: highschool drama, avoidant, loves girls that look like iy</p>

      <p>gyuvin seems like he'd be in longer relationships and gunwooks type is probably closer to softer looking girls but we know he never got confessed to so he doesn't seem situationshippy probably falls in love too easy and yujin probably was drunk off his popularity but yea I agree with you on everything else
