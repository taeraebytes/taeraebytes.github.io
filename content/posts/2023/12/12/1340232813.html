      <p>riize stans thinking they're already so big and all that and it's funny because none of their music have made enough noise for any of those accomplishments to he attributed to it. Everything has been bought for them because sm will go all in on a group after the last has failed and the cycle repeats. And they definitely ride on the coattails of nct because the music style is so similar.</p>
