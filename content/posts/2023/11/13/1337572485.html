      <p>Is it normal for survival show trainees (non zb1) to fall off so quick? I could swear keita was so loved in the interational kpop community but now nobody checks for him. Same for jay other than his stans.</p>

      <p>different anon but I have to agree with the savior complex because a lot of other trainees were hella talented and funny but didn't get any votes... but yes those may be some reasons why Keita got votes but those are the minority. There's also another reason why Keita got votes but not many international fans know about it.
