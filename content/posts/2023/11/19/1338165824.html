      <p>first and foremost I don't speak Chinese and I just woke up so I'm still confused I'm seeing many different things said but right now the consensus looks like it was just fans asking Ricky and hao to stay together cuz of their outfits for photo ops(?) but originally the zerocolas said that people were basically being rude to hanbin saying "don't go to him" at hao right? so idrk what to believe and the audio is pretty muffled even my Chinese speaking oomfs are having a hard time translating it's just sad hao and hanbin just aren't treated as people even if that wasn't the case right now it's everyday basically
