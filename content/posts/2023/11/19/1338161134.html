      <p>K rps accounts are so funny especially the gunrae & riwoong Stan‚Äôs,  I hate how gunrae Stan‚Äôs create a false personality for gw and always have to fake their interaction. And riwoong Stan‚Äôs are always editing pictures of Ricky‚Äôs body to make him appear more masculine than Jiwoong</p>
