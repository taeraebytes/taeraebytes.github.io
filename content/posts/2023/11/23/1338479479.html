      <p>im not saying anything seunghan has been revealed to do is comparable to lucas but how it plays out - the gradual leaks, tl kekeing cause it's trivial shit like smoking and getting bitches until it's funny no more - is very similar and i do think the leaker got something bigger on him ðŸ˜­ bc when the first two info came out about dozen ppl acted exactly like this too</p>

      <p>Yea I do think whatever they were threatening to leak was worse than what's been put out cuz they directly threatened sm but i heard there's been some backtracking from the leakers since sm is threatening to take legal action
