      <p>one of their admins got pissed out when rosins asked for hao to be included in the mass email text back when the weibo mass fanwar that spread to twitter happened, and also kinda said hao contributed to deaths of palestinians by drinking that starbucks coffee basically inviting people to hate on him, idrc about this situation with fanbases but i am petty and love to see them getting whacked lol</p>

      <p>now that i think about it i dont think hao is innocent. rmb that anon who spilled tea on why crosins hated ricky and went on that hate train on weibo? I think hao knows about it because I just watched their reaction to crush and hao even says "why do u get all the luxurious shots' or something along those lines to ricky and one of the reasons crosins hated ricky was because he got good parts/ edits during in bloom era. 

idk i might be reaching but...... hes kinda enforcing the crosins akgae hate towards ricky by saying stuff like that ... yikes</p>

      <p>ok you're reaching thats just haos personality/concept hes like the "bratty princess" type I don't think he'd try to do that on purpose if he was gonna fuel his akgaes he'd fuel himself into more presents but crosins might jump Ricky for that they're crazy on they're own
