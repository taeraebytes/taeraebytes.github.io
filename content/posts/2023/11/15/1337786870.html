      <p>take this with a grain of salt because It was a korean translation of a chinese weibo post that gained traction on the korean side but deleted before it really spread/ blew up. It literally just disappeared off the internet which was extremely suss. 

nyways, the post that was translated to korean from chinese that was originally posted on weibo claimed to be an ex staff that was one of multiple ppl who ran zb1 weibo and kept tabs on the chinese side of things. During in bloom both R and ZH were getting schedules but ZH fans felt R was getting too much of the spotlight in those variety shows. An example they brought up was the baby cloud ep, the producers/ editors focused more on R than ZH when ZH was P1 and they even got mad at the babies for going to R more ðŸ’€ then the whole R "cropping out ZH" in the baby cloud twt pic happened. ZH c akgaes went crazy on weibo, posting all sorts of vile shit on R's # for two weeks straight, from ince$t to body mutilati0n. It was bad. Basically every variety show they were on they made charts and counted the amount of seconds R got compared to ZH and the reactions/ editing. Like if R was getting good reactions from fans they were pissed because in their logic it means the editor is editing him well but not ZH.

ZH chinese akgaes also got mad at the amount of likes R gets on insta/ tiktok compared to ZH and would further fuel the hate R gets on Weibo. ZH c akgaes on Weibo is HUGEEE and R's chinese fans is really small, it's like 100k soldiers fighting against 100 soldiers. Then the whole boycotting the comeback thing was brought up because HB had more schedules. The staff then claimed they had multiple meetings with the higher ups on what to do because they don't want to lose ZH chinese market. 

The post was hella long but basically w1 came to the conclusion to focus on ZH and limit R's schedules this comeback to please and calm down ZH c akgaes and see how things go. This weibo post was posted early september after they got fired/ laid off idk which one but knets found it in mid October and reposted with korean translation. That post barely lasted 12 hours before the account was deleted and the original wb post gone too. And the reason I know this is because I lurk deeeeep in the kzeroses twt, they have their own lil society. Again take it with a grain of salt.</p>
