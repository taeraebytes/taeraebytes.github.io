      <p>take this with a grain of salt because It was a korean translation of a chinese weibo post that gained traction on the korean side but deleted before it really spread/ blew up. It literally just disappeared off the internet which was extremely suss. 

nyways, the post that was translated to korean from chinese that was originally posted on weibo claimed to be an ex staff that was one of multiple ppl who ran zb1 weibo and kept tabs on the chinese side of things. During in bloom both R and ZH were getting schedules but ZH fans felt R was getting too much of the spotlight in those variety shows. An example they brought up was the baby cloud ep, the producers/ editors focused more on R than ZH when ZH was P1 and they even got mad at the babies for going to R more üíÄ then the whole R "cropping out ZH" in the baby cloud twt pic happened. ZH c akgaes went crazy on weibo, posting all sorts of vile shit on R's # for two weeks straight, from ince$t to body mutilati0n. It was bad. Basically every variety show they were on they made charts and counted the amount of seconds R got compared to ZH and the reactions/ editing. Like if R was getting good reactions from fans they were pissed because in their logic it means the editor is editing him well but not ZH.

ZH chinese akgaes also got mad at the amount of likes R gets on insta/ tiktok compared to ZH and would further fuel the hate R gets on Weibo. ZH c akgaes on Weibo is HUGEEE and R's chinese fans is really small, it's like 100k soldiers fighting against 100 soldiers. Then the whole boycotting the comeback thing was brought up because HB had more schedules. The staff then claimed they had multiple meetings with the higher ups on what to do because they don't want to lose ZH chinese market. 

The post was hella long but basically w1 came to the conclusion to focus on ZH and limit R's schedules this comeback to please and calm down ZH c akgaes and see how things go. This weibo post was posted early september after they got fired/ laid off idk which one but knets found it in mid October and reposted with korean translation. That post barely lasted 12 hours before the account was deleted and the original wb post gone too. And the reason I know this is because I lurk deeeeep in the kzeroses twt, they have their own lil society. Again take it with a grain of salt.</p>

      <p>did this post also conveniently omit the part where criyangis (mostly, but other solofans also) went on the live of that guy who was spreading rumors about zh, sending donations and asking him all kinds of weird nsfw questions to the point where even the guy got weirded out and said something among the lines of ‚Äúyeah but he is a nice guy i guess‚Äù and cut that live, which was the main reason why crosins got mad and started spreading those gory stuff? like don‚Äôt get me wrong, crosins are scary, but that is a pretty important part of the story
also ricky didn‚Äôt get much stuff to begin with, so i wouldn‚Äôt say they are limiting him now more than they used to, after the bp finale the group was getting a lot of hate for having two chinese members, which is worse than having a criminal to some knets, i feel like they were planning to limit hariboz to get rid of the ‚Äúchinese group‚Äù image, the only thing kinda saving zh was him being the center, but he still didn‚Äôt get much, but after they saw how strong his fandom‚Äôs buying power was and how they were threatening to boycott wk1 decided to try and appease to them more (haohao good times was their first short term attempt, it was literally planned and filmed right after the fansign fiasco)</p>

      <p>i was just reading that post mb but i completely forgot about that its been so long woah but i dont rlly think this is the answer to all the issues surrounding ricky üò≠
yea them filming little 5 minute segments with each member on the same day crazy work... but i do think theres a huge difference between in bloom and crush hes only been on one thing so far when he had at least 3(?) like the first two weeks of in bloom promotions plus there were more group promos but idk this is a difficult issue

      <p>not the original anon but this anon got the timeline all wrong, crosins started the mass hate on weibo because of the "cropped" baby cloud picture spamming rickys weibo hashtag with gore, selfh@rm and vicious, career ruining baseless rumors and other shit and it was one week BEFORE when c riyangis went on that live and said shit. Crosins started this weibo war and criyangis fought a losing battle because their fandom is so much smaller. They had to sit there and watch crosins spam ricky's hastags for a week and you expect them to not retaliate? 

Why are you dismissing everything crosins did and only acknowledging what criyangis did? What about all the baseless career ruining rumors crosins spread first BEFORE that weibo live of that guy? why you such a hypocrite? I'm not saying what criyangis did were right but u sound so biased rn and I'm not even a ricky stan but I saw everything that was happening because the global accounts started tweeting about it, asking for help to clear ricky's hashtags because it was that bad and that was BEFORE that weibo live and somehow crosins dragged and did the same thing to gunwook, yujin and hanbin because apparently some ppl in the live were fans of them.  

Also i don't know where u get this "zb1 getting hate for having two chinese members from" if you were actually on kforums 90% had ricky and hao in the lineup. Who knets absolutely did not want was Keita.</p>

      <p>the thing u mentioned was a separate issue not related to the baby cloud thing in In Bloom era.

the baby cloud/ in bloom timeline was this but keep in mind that crosins were already pissed zh didn't get solo promotions during in bloom + no Always performance at fan con + already have existing hatred towards rik

1. Rik uploaded a picture of him and hanbin + the 2 baby clouds kids on twitter but hao's body was in frame so C rosins thought rik intentionally cropped/ edited out Hao and with their already existing hatred for rik they started a mass hate train on rik's hasgtags, from rumors to nasty edits to g0re to dead b0dies. This hate train went on for over a week, c riyangis tried clearing his hashtags but to no avail that's when they reached out to twitter riyangis and ricky global, so only riyangis knew about what was happening and then twt riyangis went onto weibo trying to help clear riks hashtags.

2. Then one week or so later, some streamer on weibo went live that "supposedly" knows hao pre debut, c riyangis and some of gunwooks, hanbins, and yujins fans were also commenting on the live and even paying for comments to be read out loud on stream which were false rumors, crosins found out and the hate train grew to rik, gunwook, hanbin and yujins hashtags. That's when all the twitter global accounts started tweeting about this issue and when zeroses found out about the hate train asking for fans to help clear all of their hashtags. 

If you weren't a riyangi you wouldn't have known Rik's hate train started 1-2 weeks before that weibo live stream happened. So c rosins are a bunch of hypocrites because it's okay for them to spread hate and rumors but if someone dares to do the same to ZH it's not okay. I'm not saying it's right to retaliate by spreading false rumors about ZH but they were desperate... I mean c rosins are a bunch of bullies because they know their fandom is way bigger then all 8 combined so they know they can do what ever they want.

I don't know much about weibo either, it was my first time going on there trying to help clear gunwooks hashtags but my moot is a riyangi so I knew everything that was happening in real time.</p>

      <p>Gunwook is in neutral(?) side there, not hated but not liked either, like he and some nugu members are alright, just don't try to be a hero and meddling other sfs wars and you'll be safe, like all of yuehuaz sfs (the biggest sfs in weibo) +allins fights every single time, it's just crosins are super massive there compare to others, but others are not saints tooüò≠</p>
