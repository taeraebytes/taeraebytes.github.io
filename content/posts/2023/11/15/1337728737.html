      <p>oh the company was def planning to mostly only push him until they saw the state of the fandom when they started doing that ðŸ˜­ like sure some specifically requested him but he was on every single schedule in the beginning, but now we can see many different variations of members and they can do more shows as one member wouldnâ€™t even have time to attend every single one on top of the schedules they have as a group</p>

      <p>like focusing on one members promotions is definitely something idky his fans act like the stark difference isnt smth to be talked ab and it would be so hard on him to do all that
