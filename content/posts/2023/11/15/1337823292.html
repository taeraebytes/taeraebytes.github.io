      <p>matthew def stalks twt lmao he saw how popular hanbin and his hamster doll were so he did the same with his own doll but then hb fans called him out for copying hb and as soon as they did matthew suddenly stopped posting pics of his doll, he even said on his bbl live something along the lines of 'i don't think people were a fan of his doll'</p>
