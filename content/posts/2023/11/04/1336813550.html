      <p>im an ot9 but im gonna be honest i find jwâ€™s vocal tone awkward idk itâ€™s just that itâ€™s not very pleasing to listen to and his dancing esp when they danced to rover gw and jw gave the same ampunt of energy but you can clearly see how different they execute the choreo gwâ€™s moves doesnt look awkward but jwâ€™s a little bit off like his alignment and lower body is sokfkfkffkmfmg</p>
