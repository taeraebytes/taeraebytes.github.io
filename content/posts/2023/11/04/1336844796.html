      <p>Gunwook looks great, Taerae poor thing lookin a lil rough , zhang Hao got better but still a lil off, hanbin is doing his thing, Ricky is surprisingly keeping up but need to improve a lil more, canâ€™t see Yujin or gyuvin, they are shoving Jiwoong down our throats Fr, and I  just now noticed Matthew</p>
