      <p>zb1 have more haters than fans atp like most of the fandom got shit for brains weâ€™re supposed to be defending them but weâ€™re the ones hating on them ðŸ˜­ when the teaser dropped half of the tl was shitting on it like yâ€™all would rather side with the enemy than fib and lie ? we need this cb to rail in the crazy diehard fans like stays bc these in bloom token stans did not contribute shit to their success</p>
