      <p>i think a lot of it is bc male voices sound more aggressive so noise music sung by women doesnâ€™t seem as like harsh idk. but honestly even if crush is noise i think it will be taken well bc of the vocals. like nct 127 and aespa are like the definition of noise music but ppl like their songs bc the vocals carry. whereas u look at stray kids who has extremely weak vocals and they just rap or yell over the track, which is why less ppl enjoy listening to it. either way the b sides r gonna eat and i love the crush instrumental except for the beat drop part  so im not too worried</p>
