      <p>Amun yes, it was cute af but now itâ€™s just too much. Gyuvin said heâ€™s always writing his twt captions for him and you can tell because thereâ€™s always like a dumb joke or wording in them and yk ricky he doesnâ€™t really play around like that. I follow k ris on priv and they all feel like the muyaho joke + the other stuff is humiliating him</p>
