      <p>itâ€™s because of his reveal cover. he looked really good there because that dance requires a lot more angled and straight moves so gyuvin could easily cover up his stiffness and coordination issues. and he had really good stage presence there so ppl said he was good based on that</p>

      <p>what's funny is that I'm on deobitwt and he got dragged so bad for the cover like I'm sorry it wasn't goodðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it was one of his better showcases again but maybe it's cuz I'm actually a fan I wasn't rating it

      <p>iâ€™m still baffled as to how yuehuaz got all those good ratings, only good singer was hao and even that wasnt his best performance, sorry but some under the table deals must have been made. yujin and gyuvins performances gave middle school talent show but they were raving about it like it was the 2nd coming of christ.</p>
