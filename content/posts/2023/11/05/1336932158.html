      <p>somebody got jumped for saying that crush sounded like savageâ€™s dance break and i was like ??? cuz when i listened to them back to back they genuinely sounded so similar ðŸ˜­ ppl just think ggs are inherently superior, aespa could release crush and they would still call it better than anything a bg could release</p>
