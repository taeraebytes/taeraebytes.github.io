      <p>Uhm lol matthew was left out on the radio show thingy 8/9 members were sent i think that’s why they started complaining and that’s literally so weird of wakeone not sending one member and they just started complaining recently. All subfandoms were complaining but seokryus can’t??? can we just shit on wakeone bcs its their fault</p>
