      <p>I mean I’m only here for gw so I don’t really care to much but I find it interesting that rosins are slightly more chill with the obvious rotating Center with Yujin than with hanbin when imo the rotating Center thing with hanbin ( in bloom era) wasn’t as obvious as it is with Yujin now e.g he didn’t do the intro or outro ?</p>
