      <p>ZB1 are very open to talking about their BP friends and old companies in a way I never seen other survival show groups do before. It could just be a Wakeone thing but Izone and W1 were practically banned from mentioning their past labels and trainee friends, while here Hao is being taken to airport by Yuehua staff, members are mentioning Yuehuaz and Wakeonez like every other day. Its almost as they're getting ready for their futures right in front of zeroses eyes lmao, its not a huge deal but interesting</p>
