      <p>Tea Anon back idk abt youâ€™re other ones tho, some kfans have clocked that a certain member has been stalking rps twt with the spelling and phrases he used (you can prolly guess who). Also some ppl think zb1 as a group  have a weird relationship with fans like the constant calling during lives, receiving gifts & texting back in forth with them like no other produce group were allowed to do that ðŸ˜¬.</p>

      <p>heyyy but yea I clocked that as soon as I saw the translation dropped like ewwwww no I get curiosity and searching urself and going down a rabbit hole BUT USING IT ON BLL...ðŸ˜­ the weird relationship definitely stems from the attachments to their personal fandoms and wakeone fueling their ssgs by leaking their info and not really doing anything to help but yea it's because they wanna keep their dedicated fans and it's hard to say no to people who dedicate their every minute to you
