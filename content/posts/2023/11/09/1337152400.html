      <p>I can see its so funny how gg stans will quite literally contradict themselves just to hate likeeeeee crushs beat is even less noisy than savages but they'll claim it's worse just cuz they want to

      <p>i think a lot of it is bc male voices sound more aggressive so noise music sung by women doesnâ€™t seem as like harsh idk. but honestly even if crush is noise i think it will be taken well bc of the vocals. like nct 127 and aespa are like the definition of noise music but ppl like their songs bc the vocals carry. whereas u look at stray kids who has extremely weak vocals and they just rap or yell over the track, which is why less ppl enjoy listening to it. either way the b sides r gonna eat and i love the crush instrumental except for the beat drop part  so im not too worried</p>

      <p>nah zb1 is worlds better than skz vocally wdym. like as a group they are better than any 4th gen bg. obviously not nct or aespa level but skzâ€™s main vocalist is mid d tier (by kva standards) while zb1â€™s 5th best vocalist is mid d. and majority of skz members are non vocalists and not even that they can sound decent but lack technique/support but they actually sing like shit. even gyuvin can at least hold a note. zb1 also sounds infinitely better live</p>

      <p>any 4th gen group? uhhhh maybe 2z but there's plenty with strong vocalists in the 4th gen for bgs but hmmmm I can see that it's just the diff between singing members and non singing members in zb1 can be so stark sometimes

      <p>i hate when ppl say zb1's vocals are better than any 4th gen bg's vocals like i thought when ppl said 4th gen bgs suck at singing we were aware that that's a generalization? not all of them can be bad at singing there are so many of them that doesn't even make sense ðŸ˜­ have people ever seen jongho from ateez sing? he's amazing and definitely better than every single zb1 member?</p>

      <p>mmmmmmmmmmm I wouldn't use jongho he does a whole bunch of yelling and straining but he's definitely better than zb1 maybe haorae could catch up to him w some training but the generalization is annoying because a lot of group have rlly good vocalists
