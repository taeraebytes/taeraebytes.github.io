      <p>I thought it was just me who noticed the double standard treatment GW gets from the fandom, the way allindans & woongdeongies baby gyuvin so much and talk abt how he don’t deserve the hate he gets but then will turn around and say nasty stuff abt GW because of beef on twt or the fact that his fans calling him an ace/main dancer</p>

      <p>the double standard is crazy I think some of it has to do with the fact that they're threatened but also they get no back talk from gpds as a whole except for like maybe 5 but that's changing they're gonna learn to accept the fact there's only ONE all rounder in the group
