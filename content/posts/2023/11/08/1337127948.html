      <p>just remembered taerae's messages after camp zb1 in july to gunwook after camp zb1 saying he has regrets over not getting closer to him before (
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
 and taerae saying he fell for gyuvin's charms and bc of him he never thought he'd be lonely (

 [the "things you did because you wanted to be closer to me" btw refers to.. gyuvin playing with taerae's zippers backstage of the k vs g performances... taerae really overanalyzed that) 
aw i feel bad for him all these months later and he doesn't really have a close friend in the group... but it's also a bit funny that taerae said he can be closer to gunwook in the future bc taerae is the one ignoring him mostly like pal what are you doing</p>

      <p>wasnt he kinda mad at gyuvin for thatðŸ‘€ but I feel like gunwook and taerae couldnt been good friends cuz they weren't complete strangers on the show and gunwooks just nice and friendly so if he regretted not getting closer than that he probably rlly did wanna be friends but smth definitely happened cuz somewhere in the middle(summer) he started ignoring him
