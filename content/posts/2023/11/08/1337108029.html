 [the "things you did because you wanted to be closer to me" btw refers to.. gyuvin playing with taerae's zippers backstage of the k vs g performances... taerae really overanalyzed that) 
aw i feel bad for him all these months later and he doesn't really have a close friend in the group... but it's also a bit funny that taerae said he can be closer to gunwook in the future bc taerae is the one ignoring him mostly like pal what are you doing</p>
