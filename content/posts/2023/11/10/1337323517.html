      <p>doesn't matter if ur a vocalist or sub vocalist if ur voice is annoying af ur going to get no lines, unless ur a woondeongie who is in denial. ppl like to blame wakeone as if they got something against jiwoong but forget they contract composers and producers that don't give two shits about who wakeone likes and dislikes and ultimately it's up to them to choose who suits which parts for the best results.

i just find it hilarious because they don't know how the industry works and woondeongies are basically indirectly dissing jiwoong by doing all this yet theyre clueless and think theyre helping him.</p>
