I wouldnâ€™t normally add input but he said he lost 30kgs and as someone who lost 26kg myself I had people say it looked like I had worked done even though I had nothing. Although I agree with the normal dude sentiment, if he has/hasnâ€™t had work done his face fits the beauty standard but not in the way where he has sharp sticking features.

      <p>ricky is actually one of the more natural members because the only thing he has done is chin filler. he has T bone structure of a god so when he has make up on + lenses he looks like an ai and that what makes people think he has his face done. it's tough being pretty ðŸ˜­ yet hanbin who had his whole face rebuild is having the time of his life hiding in the background because even after all that work he still looks like some normal dude</p>

      <p>It's because Ricky's features are sharp and they get even sharper with the makeup which he doesn't look the best in imo he's the prettiest when he's more rounded out he rlly does look ai w it tho
