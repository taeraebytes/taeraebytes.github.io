      <p>Iâ€™m sorry if this is kinda malicious but I always laugh when I see Ricky stand next to TaeraeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Theyre just polar opposites and i hate to use the term but he mugs him so badly,</p>

      <p>the only think ricky got done is chin filler and maybe some nose filler taerae got more work i think. however the chin filler is overdone at sometimes but recently i think heâ€™s been dissolving it so itâ€™s more subtle</p>

      <p>taerae got a rhinoplasty for sure, and facial (and possibly a little lip) filler. his face used to be sort of flat (?) but now its very soft and round. honestly i dont think the members have gotten too much done except for hanbin (and obviosly the maknaes who i dont think have gotten anything). even jiwoong i dont think has had as much as ppl say he has (obviously he does have veneers and botox) bc he looks identical to his older brother</p>

      <p>I don't think he did his nose doesn't look noticeable my different maybe filler to raise it and jiwoong is just a botox fiend so he looks bloated a lot
