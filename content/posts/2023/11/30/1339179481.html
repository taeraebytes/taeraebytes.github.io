      <p>i think riize and zb1 are kinda equal rn with zb1 having the bigger fanbase but riize having more gp recognition but i feel like riize is going to grow bigger than zb1 soon. saying this as a zerose. their mama stages got more attention than zb1 despite zb1 having more budget (and being more interesting imo ðŸ˜ª)</p>
