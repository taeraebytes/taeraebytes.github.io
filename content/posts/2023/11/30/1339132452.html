      <p>Ricky just need to let the filler dissolve and stop doing it you can tell heâ€™s self conscious, Taerae botched 2, after he gained weight during camp zb1 wk1 gave him fillers and some other stuff..his bruising got bad thatâ€™s why his makeup was so cakey for a long period too much powder</p>

      <p>at first I seriously thought he got his whole face done, eyes, nose and jaw and even skin bleaching but then the more I paid attention to him I realized he's actually natural except maybe chin filler but ppl don't even consider filler as ps tbh. 

For his eyes I thought he had double eyelid surgery but then I saw that child pic of him drinking from a straw and he clearly already has double eyelids since a child but he still wears eyelid tape during stages because they're uneven or he wants them a bit deeper/ higher especially during BP but now they're lower so I don't think he wears them as much.

His T-zone is crazy but natural, like u can never achieve that kinda nose with ps. Also thought he bleached his skin, don't want to get into the whole light skin dark skin thing but his childhood pics he was pretty tan but he's pale af now and that was probably because he played a lot of out door sports, he was on the soccer team and tennis team iirc but then I saw his moms pic and shes pale af.

I won't lie I fell victim of that braces pic of him that's why I thought he had his whole face done + skin bleaching but that picture was taken when he was 11 or 12 before puberty even hits, before facial features start developing/ maturing so I feel bad for shit talking but it's also why I'm speaking up now because I realized it's lame when ppl compare u now to when ur 11. Ofc ur going to look way different and glow ups are a thing.</p>
