      <p>Lol.no riize is not big like wanna one, even can't compare to zb1. Gag is only 1 hit wonder song, while the other song hard to enter melon. most of zb1song chart on melon though the rank is lower. If u want who bigger, just look at the streaming amount. 140M (6 songs) compare to 20M (2 songs). wanna one has korean in their palm, but riize even still strugling on vote, while zb1 still has strong voting team. from sales zb1 far ahead riize, so why zb1 smaller than riize?? please comeback again when riize can soldout gocheok dome after 1 month of debut.</p>
