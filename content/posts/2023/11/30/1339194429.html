      <p>ricky is actually one of the more natural members because the only thing he has done is chin filler. he has T bone structure of a god so when he has make up on + lenses he looks like an ai and that what makes people think he has his face done. it's tough being pretty üò≠ yet hanbin who had his whole face rebuild is having the time of his life hiding in the background because even after all that work he still looks like some normal dude</p>

      <p>It's because Ricky's features are sharp and they get even sharper with the makeup which he doesn't look the best in imo he's the prettiest when he's more rounded out he rlly does look ai w it tho

      <p>Half agree with the hanbin one, if you look at childhood pics he looks very similar I think he‚Äôs just had his nose and jaw (possibly) done. It‚Äôs kinda hard to tell with him because in the teenage years where you would compare usually he lost a shit ton of weight since then. I wouldn‚Äôt normally add input but he said he lost 30kgs and as someone who lost 26kg myself I had people say it looked like I had worked done even though I had nothing. Although I agree with the normal dude sentiment, if he has/hasn‚Äôt had work done his face fits the beauty standard but not in the way where he has sharp sticking features. The only way I can explain it is he definitely has an actor face over an idol face</p>

      <p>He definitely got his nose done the tip is raised high and I think they went a little too skinny on the bridge but other than that he has a pretty nice nose job I think his eyes as well but with his weight loss a lot of that counters in and yea he has like a tv face
