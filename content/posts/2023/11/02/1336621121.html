      <p>He realized that he misses his friends, the idol life not for him. He would be better going to uni and  singing in church with his grandparents like he used to than zb1 who have minors, bl actors, members who have adhd, alleged gay men & a FOB from LA. Park hanbin got to cocky having  the boys planet EP in his ear telling him he was going to be a star just to get replaced by his hannam friend, I would be mad two.</p>
