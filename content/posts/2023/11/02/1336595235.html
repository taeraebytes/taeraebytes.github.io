      <p>Sung hanbin is the only advanced dancer, the minor and PGW are decent and getting better as they grow. Adhd puppy tries but just looks silly, never beating the neurodivergent accusations. FOB from LA, ZH, Basic Boy Taerae & Sweet teeth are all non dancers. lil Matt can move a lil bit but doesn‚Äôt know how to execute idol dances, the click like tiktok was ROUGH. FOB from LA must come from a family with a lot of PCOS, you can tell he produces more estrogen than testosterone and not only that but he took dance classes and still couldn‚Äôt improve, ZH non dancer but talented IG.. he‚Äôll get pushed to the front just so cfans want overreact, basic boy Taerae looks silly and they knew they was wrong for trying to hype him up with that that ‚Äú Go Tae Rae‚Äù shi</p>
