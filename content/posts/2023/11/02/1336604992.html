      <p>Mark my words ZB1 is about to have same trajectory as Kep1er. Internationally keep losing fans until the majority remaining become solo stans or fighting within each other everyday. Kfans leave to other groups (started happening since the fancon). Music quality decrease (we don't know yet but we do know other 5th gen groups are coming out with really strong music, in bloom is ok but can't compete). At least Kep1er has the Japanese market on lockdown, if Zb1 gain new and stronger fanbase during this comeback it's going to be really bad for them.</p>

      <p>well no kepla were never anywhere near zb1 level of fame boys planet did surprisingly well for gp999 being the predecessor so even if there's a huge decline it's not gonna be like that we'll have to wait and see how the cb does I think in bloom was just a safe choice as was every 5th gen debut and their competitors aren't making any better music either
