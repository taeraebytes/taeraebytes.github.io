      <p>one thing that irks about zeroses tho is that theyâ€™ll try to make everything a ship. they see a pair be affectionate & start going nuts like canâ€™t we just appreciate real brotherhood anymore ? (idm rps btw it just makes me cringe when ppl force a ship thatâ€™s so painfully platonic)</p>
