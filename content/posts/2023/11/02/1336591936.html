      <p>I don't think they would've spoken up it's their manager yelling at Ricky intervening would make it worse for him and obviously the manager has all the power they don't have any authority to help it wouldn't be any different

      <p>Sweet teeth has been an idol since 3rd Gen,  FOB from LA is one of his last concerns, the man is about his bank, try’s to latch on to what is popular, strictly business with his group. The BL checks weren’t cutting enough so he had to get in to what is more popular (idol industry & variety) unfortunately his show is pulling in  even less views than dongpyo & woonggi’s show on YouTube, maybe it’s time to hand it up, except straight naught, announce engagement and audition for knowing bros cast. Sung hanbin is happy with his career, after the fall from BP he still manages to get handed offers a produce center would be treated with, great for him. I will say the youth pastor act is tiring but at least he try’s his best to not get caught up in stuff, boring personality, great speaking voice however Mc checks not gonna cut it he might wanna pursue in more stuff, also a teachers (staff) pet he’s not defending  ricky. Lil Matt I pity him, dropped out of a great university to debut in a survival show group that is falling right before our eyes, on top of that he’s hated by the fandom and the staff prolly don’t like him as well, no more queer bait with sweet teeth or Taerae, so now he’s busy chatting with fans on a burner and online gaming with 16 yr olds, I will say I admire his passion to work out for his bod, It’s best if he just mind his business.</p>
