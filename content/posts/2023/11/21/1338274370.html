      <p>one of their admins got pissed out when rosins asked for hao to be included in the mass email text back when the weibo mass fanwar that spread to twitter happened, and also kinda said hao contributed to deaths of palestinians by drinking that starbucks coffee basically inviting people to hate on him, idrc about this situation with fanbases but i am petty and love to see them getting whacked lol</p>
