      <p>Gyuvin is so bad in performances it genuinely pisses me off, there are two members who are worse than him in dancing but they make up for it in other areas and at least expressions are okay. Gyuvin looks like heâ€™s constipated while heâ€™s performing and he cant even make up for it with good rapping or singing ughhh</p>
