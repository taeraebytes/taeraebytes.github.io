      <p>I'm gonna do this worst to best cuz it's easier to narrow down and start with the demonic people.

1. Allindans- just riddled with annoying akgaes and terrorize everything ab the group also they're so greedy and accuse everyone of hating hanbin and pray for disbandment. If they catch a whiff of what they think is hanbin trust ur getting jumped in 0.5 secs
2. Woongpoopies- usually they're in their own bubble being annoying and stupid but just like hb fans they jump ppl for any and everything but the way they act like jiwoong must be handled w utter care and like a king WDC all of them are psychotic 
3. Riyangis- very loud and annoying yes Ricky has issues and mistreatment but they get upset if they think you're not taking it serious and then they switch these conversations around his mistreatment to solo schedules and bring up knowing bros everyday meanwhile the only members having solo scheds are hanbin and jiwoong and he was lucky enough to have a decent amt of promotion in in bloom but if you bring that up they'll get upset and say you hate Ricky and you want him to flop and you're scared of his fame
4. Rosins=Gyuvinists- gyuvinists I just have a personal grudge against just like they have a grudge against gpdsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they can't let shit go and get loud and annoying so quick. The thing is I can understand rosins at least on intl twt because allindan akgaes are 10x worse here weibo is another story but I can't speak for that! But I would say overall they can get really nasty but specifically intl they're cool if I was just considering that I'd put them lower.
5. Seokryus- I'd put them higher but they got quiet and chill they used to be one of thee worst sfs though during april to july which I can kinda get everyone hated Matthew but they were actually terrorists.
6. Geonppangdans- my people but they can get annoying quick icl focusing on the wrong things and also being highly depressed ab everything which I can't speak too much on cuz I'm the same but also the people leading gpd twt on the intl side are just soooooo ugh
7. Kultaeraes- make no noise so idc ab them but they can be annoying 
8. Mulbokdans- they're quiet
