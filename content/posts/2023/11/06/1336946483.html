      <p>okay i was lurking on k-forums to see what they think of zb1 and stumbled on lgbt forum - they really like taerae and think he’s ideal cute bottom type and he gets upvotes in the thousands which is hard unlike ur big like d.o or wonho. they were even discussing why he’s not amongst popular members , they also like hao and dont mind hanbin but they think he’s hiding himself too much. they dont really like jiwoong and think he’s a fake bl actor (korean gay men dont like bl actors!) and dont speak about the rest.</p>
