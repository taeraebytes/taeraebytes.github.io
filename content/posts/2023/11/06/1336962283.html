      <p>I can see its so funny how gg stans will quite literally contradict themselves just to hate likeeeeee crushs beat is even less noisy than savages but they'll claim it's worse just cuz they want to

      <p>i think a lot of it is bc male voices sound more aggressive so noise music sung by women doesnâ€™t seem as like harsh idk. but honestly even if crush is noise i think it will be taken well bc of the vocals. like nct 127 and aespa are like the definition of noise music but ppl like their songs bc the vocals carry. whereas u look at stray kids who has extremely weak vocals and they just rap or yell over the track, which is why less ppl enjoy listening to it. either way the b sides r gonna eat and i love the crush instrumental except for the beat drop part  so im not too worried</p>

      <p>nah zb1 is worlds better than skz vocally wdym. like as a group they are better than any 4th gen bg. obviously not nct or aespa level but skzâ€™s main vocalist is mid d tier (by kva standards) while zb1â€™s 5th best vocalist is mid d. and majority of skz members are non vocalists and not even that they can sound decent but lack technique/support but they actually sing like shit. even gyuvin can at least hold a note. zb1 also sounds infinitely better live</p>

      <p>any 4th gen group? uhhhh maybe 2z but there's plenty with strong vocalists in the 4th gen for bgs but hmmmm I can see that it's just the diff between singing members and non singing members in zb1 can be so stark sometimes

      <p>Yeah theyâ€™re technique is better but none of them have really nice tones (I think skz is shit this cc has nothing to do with them btw a lot of them have bad tones too), the only vocal tones I like are zhang hao and gunwook, taerae has a very unique tone that just sounds really bad with a song or really good with a song(I think itâ€™s just the style that he sings), hanbin sounds to airy for me but sometimes it sounds good, I really do not like ricky, yujin, gyuvin and gyuvins tones (I usually mix up the last three bc of their similar tones) and matthews a fuck ass Canadian I donâ€™t like the way he pronounces things</p>

      <p>yea I'd say maybe seungmin is the most listenable I heard changmins a good singer too but he doesn't do that in their songs obv and I agree with you on zb1s vocals but yujin I like his a bit it's a weak one but he's getting better and matthew I only notice when he's speaking not singing

      <p>Ricky's tone is unique tho? like I haven't heard a similar tone to his in the kpop scene and he's not even my bias. I feel like if he developed it more there's a lot of potential. Some people shit on him for trying to hit high notes/ sing out of his range but as a vocal coach, not saying I am but in general that's a good sign he's not afraid to hit them and he's willing to push himself. Just needs to work on development, pronunciation and learn to not go overboard because if you compare his english/ korean covers to his chinese ones, the chinese ones sound wayy better. I was shocked how good his chinese covers were from yesterdays live.

but remember, ZB1 are all rookies, their vocals can grow and developed as they start finding their style. They just need a good vocal coach that can bring out the best of it.</p>

      <p>I like Ricky's tone it's definitely soft but not like thin I do think though he needs some rigorous vocal training and he's be set
