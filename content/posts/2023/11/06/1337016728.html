      <p>okay i was lurking on k-forums to see what they think of zb1 and stumbled on lgbt forum - they really like taerae and think heâ€™s ideal cute bottom type and he gets upvotes in the thousands which is hard unlike ur big like d.o or wonho. they were even discussing why heâ€™s not amongst popular members , they also like hao and dont mind hanbin but they think heâ€™s hiding himself too much. they dont really like jiwoong and think heâ€™s a fake bl actor (korean gay men dont like bl actors!) and dont speak about the rest.</p>

      <p>what's the link to the forum i'm nosy also taerae is seriously peak omega like the entire basis of junrae which kfans apparently love was literally just him laughing at all of his jokes, being clingy, looking at him affectionately. which is also what he's doing now with gyuvin oh lord. i'm glad that it seems like he recognizes his fanbase judging by his photos lol</p>

      <p>tbh he didnt feed into junrae it all happened extremely quickly in the first two weeks of bp during the practice behind of back door when they were being sus as hell, iâ€™m ship-repellant but even i was a bit like woah i wouldnt be shocked if they had a minor crush on each other despite what their sexuality might be. if taerae was smart heâ€™d do more onto gunwook ik its morally iffy for i-fans to ship gwk yet but him and taerae is a big ship in korea if they play up to it more then who knows where the potential will goðŸ‘€</p>
