      <p>yooo i watch taerae content closely and i find it kinda funny that people speak like hes some loner because i dont find him isolated at alll since like august? i think he and matthew used to be pretty tight for a while because of the age thing to the point where matthews mother called him matthews best friend but i think they finally realized they dont have much interests in commom so they drifted apart üò≠ but nowadays he and hao are really cliquey theyre always whispering and with inside jokes and they even had beef bc they were supposed to do something together on chuseok and taerae dipped ‚ò†Ô∏è its really cute hope they last more than bbangiz lol glad we can all collectively agree that gyurae is ass and taerae needs to leave that boy alone</p>

      <p>he just seems like a floater sometimes but yea mattrae happened so fast they became bffs out of nowhere the crying for each other thing still makes me laugh cuz whyüò≠? But they drifted apart yea and it kind of looks like taerae gets annoyed by Matthew now idk if I'm the only one that noticed but him and hao are cute I like the dynamic i didnt see it coming and yea nobody likes gyurae ewwww
