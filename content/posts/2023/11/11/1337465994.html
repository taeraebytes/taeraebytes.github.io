      <p>It wonâ€™t be Sunk from 1st place Hanbin because heâ€™s a  parasocialism junkie & bsongee herself loves him, it also wonâ€™t be FOB from LA because he doesnâ€™t walk outside without his earrings, fancy outfit and he doesnâ€™t like hoodies, Sweet teeth is too busy filming a variety show ngaf about and drinking casamigos in korean z lister party pits with his GF, he doesnâ€™t even live in the dorm. It  canâ€™t be basic Taerae because his proportions are too basic, canâ€™t be lil Matt cause he lil, who knows maybe itâ€™s ZH, or Maybe itâ€™s pgw but something tells me itâ€™s not because his neck isnâ€™t that long, so that means itâ€™s adhd puppy.</p>
