      <p>those aren't rp names but rp ppl use it. Think of it like censoring their names so instead of saying gunwook we use gw but in korean its just spelling the name differently. Gunwook = Gunwuk etc though it's usually just one korean character so Gun = Ghun etc. 

y? They're lazy, they don't want want to type their entire government name every time they want to talk about the members. But you can tell it's rp when it's a combination of two characters from two members. From what I remember gyuvin used his 'censored' name only.</p>

      <p>well the known rps ship is 귭맄 and everyone one there refers to them as 귭 and 맄 separately like it's just too popular on there I get that it literally is their names shortened like I agree with you but it's just wayyyy too easy to see how it looks like he surfs rps twitter it may or may not be the case it's just smth he's gotta be careful ab cuz I saw it and immediately went "????"
