      <p>found and stalked through your cc and itâ€™s funny as hell but some people here are so miserable damn

because yall talk about group dynamics sm just want to clarify that as someone whoâ€™s tried to stan every post-p101 group (kepler and enhypen too) zb1 is easily one of the closest. yall may think theyâ€™re cliquey but some of those past groups had members that actively disliked each other very obviously

also haorae going to be real besties by end of contract and we are going to get taerae away from evnne and phanbins sketchy ass so trust me yall will have to stop instnuanting that heâ€™s a friendless loser soon

another thing as a gpd we really need better intl representation because the popular accs suck esp that weird one that is always doing wayyy too much

finally the zb1 lineup and members are actually pretty great for a survival show and even tho some of the members have rocks for brains sometimes and annoy me occasionally I do like them all on a certain level like I even try to watch all the solo content because I have time nowadays

the only member I canâ€™t stand is jiwoong he didnâ€™t bother me before but his show is so boring, he constantly messes up during perfs, his voice sucks despite being a senior of several years and while irdc about idols dating heâ€™s so obvious with it that pretty much everyone knows while being bad at his job. if we removed him we could reduce the whackings zb1 gets by at least 50%, another 30% could be reduced by removing Gyuvin but heâ€™s funny as fuck and the group would be 80% more boring with him gone so I love him and vote to keep him in</p>

      <p>as long as they never get to enhypen level then I'm good tbh idc how cliquey they get

I just noticed their friendship yesterday it's cute I thought they'd be surface level friends but they really seem to like "get" each other it's surprising 

Intl gpds either are annoying talk too fucking much or got ran off they used to be one of the crazier sfs during boys planet but half of them got cancelled or pushed to private accsðŸ˜­

and yea this lineup is the best we could've got I don't see them being any better if they had some diff members but yea jiwoong needs to start caring about the job a little more I know you're set for the future now but it's been 4 months cmon and same I like gyuvin he keeps it fun for me and he's cute so I wouldn't switch him out
