      <p>those aren't rp names but rp ppl use it. Think of it like censoring their names so instead of saying gunwook we use gw but in korean its just spelling the name differently. Gunwook = Gunwuk etc though it's usually just one korean character so Gun = Ghun etc. 

y? They're lazy, they don't want want to type their entire government name every time they want to talk about the members. But you can tell it's rp when it's a combination of two characters from two members. From what I remember gyuvin used his 'censored' name only.</p>

      <p>well the known rps ship is Í∑≠ÎßÑ and everyone one there refers to them as Í∑≠ and ÎßÑ separately like it's just too popular on there I get that it literally is their names shortened like I agree with you but it's just wayyyy too easy to see how it looks like he surfs rps twitter it may or may not be the case it's just smth he's gotta be careful ab cuz I saw it and immediately went "????"

      <p>first gyubrik is so nugu in kr so i don't think he's on rps tweet unless he used Îäò or Ï≤≠ which obviously made by their rpsers and not related to their real name but Í∑≠ and ÎßÑ  are just their shortened names and gw once called yj Ïú†ÎîòÏù¥ (one of yj's censored names) too on bbl  but i don't think he's on rps tho i think they just like to call eo in a cute way (sorry for my broken eng)</p>
