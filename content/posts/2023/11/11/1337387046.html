      <p>the jiwong show with hao in jeju was basically advertisement for chinese tourist ðŸ’€ I thought it was weird when we saw them going to jeju weeks ago because they don't seem close but now it makes so much sense lmao</p>

      <p>lmao y did i expect u to actually watch the jiwoong show ðŸ˜‚ basically they went to a bunch of places in jeju that coincidently had cinese translations every where and when they bought something or paid for food they kept showing them paying using a 'special' credit card that chinese people can use and even receive a discount, they even had the cashier explain the perks of using that credit card at every place they went to lmao they didn;t even try to hide it</p>
