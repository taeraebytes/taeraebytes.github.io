Jiwoong is just a lost cause, cause he brainwashed himself to thinking he;s the king of dancing but he just moves however he wants. Even more stiff members like Gyuvin Taerae can complete a move but he thinks his short ass can move on already. This is turning into a Sweet tooth anon cc but I get them now, the guy is starting to give me bad vibes.",

And that dance show he won as well apparently idk but with that that he definitely thinks he's sufficient enough and doesn't get technicalities down it just sucks he gets to be in the front over the better dancers. gyuvin and taerae their problems are more apparent and they'd probably get better with time I can tell gyuvin improved a lot already and taerae is just those main vocals that can't dance but that's fine he brings smth to table irdc"
