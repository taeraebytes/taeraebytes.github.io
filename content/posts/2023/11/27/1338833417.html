      <p>no but hao really needs to be careful with what he says because his fans are lunatics especially c rosins. I get he's the bratty princess that complains and jokes around but hanbin is catching it now cause of what he said in the fancall. It may be a joke to hao but crosins take that shit seriously... i really do hope he's just clueless about his own fandom and how they act</p>
