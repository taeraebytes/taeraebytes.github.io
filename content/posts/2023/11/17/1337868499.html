      <p>im kr but not super fluent it seems like op is exposing that bbosongee is a 24year old man that lives in seongsandong (idk why this matters) and their conversation is about bbosongee saying he will expose something (was not mentioned in the dm screenshots) about a group after 10k rts and op asking whether its about zb1 or not

bbossongee said its not zb1 (or jang wonyoung??? ðŸ˜­) so nothing to worry about 
but qrts and replies are saying bsg mightve just been lying (not sure if its abt his personal info)</p>
