      <p>is anon talking about the one were he invited his classmates to their fancon? If so, the post was basically screen shot of one of the classmate (which is a girl) ig story of the fancon stage. It went viral because based on the view, those were vip seats intended for close friends and family so knets were suss. And then they brought up a past picture of yj with another girl classmate predebut taking a GROUP photo claiming the girl at fancon was the same girl in the group pic and they have been dating ever since. 

It went viral on pann nate and even on k twt but then knets found out the girl wasn't even the same girl from the predebut group picture and the one that posted the ig story wasn't the only one invited to fancon, a bunch of his other close classmates were also invited so the op delete the post themselves because it was clear their intent was malicious.

Also pann nate is not a good site for zeroses, a bunch of ex bp trainees post there creating all sorts of zb1 rumors because their one pick didn't make it. There's also no link because op deleted it but screenshots prob exists somewhere.</p>
