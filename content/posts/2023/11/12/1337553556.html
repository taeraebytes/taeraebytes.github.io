      <p>Umm i have a confession to make I was the biggest taerae stan during BP my acc was very big but i had to make an excuse to leave cause I wasnt feeling him In bloom era.. now Im a hanbin and gunwook stan with no regrets. Theres something I realised only when he debuted that the idol life isnt for him, and I just started getting cringed out with his performance. Good luck to him though I really supported u x</p>
