      <p>Mark my words ZB1 is about to have same trajectory as Kep1er. Internationally keep losing fans until the majority remaining become solo stans or fighting within each other everyday. Kfans leave to other groups (started happening since the fancon). Music quality decrease (we don't know yet but we do know other 5th gen groups are coming out with really strong music, in bloom is ok but can't compete). At least Kep1er has the Japanese market on lockdown, if Zb1 gain new and stronger fanbase during this comeback it's going to be really bad for them.</p>

      <p>well no kepla were never anywhere near zb1 level of fame boys planet did surprisingly well for gp999 being the predecessor so even if there's a huge decline it's not gonna be like that we'll have to wait and see how the cb does I think in bloom was just a safe choice as was every 5th gen debut and their competitors aren't making any better music either

      <p>The only think Kep1er lacked was ability to market themselves amongst the other ggs, in reality Wadada did MUCH better than In bloom in all metrics except Korea. Now zb1 is gonna face the same issue as their newest competition has grabbed the attention of Korea and Tiktok, and it doesn't help that In Bloom didn't generate new fans either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

      <p>wadada was also heavily made fun of and their second cb flopped so hard they basically only had seasia and hybe fans on their side in bloom did fine before the competition they may have outdone but it doesn't take away from the fact it did pretty good like I said we'll have to wait and see how crush does to actually gauge anything

      <p>idk why you guys are acting like this it‚Äôs kpop it moves fast you can be a big group and get overshadowed by another that doesn‚Äôt mean a group loses popularity when the next group comes they‚Äôll forget abt all the hybe then repeat and the cycle keeps going. zb1 had they moment in june-mid august now their competition is getting it then next they‚Äôll to move another group then another it the cycle of kpop</p>
