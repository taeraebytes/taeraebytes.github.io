      <p>I don't think they would've spoken up it's their manager yelling at Ricky intervening would make it worse for him and obviously the manager has all the power they don't have any authority to help it wouldn't be any different

      <p>Absent father & no older member to look up to, poor child. He has no proper name figure in his live. His mother seems too occupied with her business to tune in to zb1 but at least she helped him get into yuehua & supports from afar. He better help retire her and continue her work once she gets older.</p>

      <p>has anon ever heard about separating business from family and privacy? Anon probably gossips about their own family to their co workers and vice versa. No, they probably don't even have a job by the way their always camping ppl cc's.

His family is on a different level than us peasants if we're being completely honest, chaebol level from everything that we have seen, I mean wearing a 50K watch while in a dog onesie for example. Just because you never seen anything about his father doesn't mean he doesn't support him, him and family have boundaries when it comes to privacy and that's respectable.
