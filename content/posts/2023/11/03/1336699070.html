      <p>Zerobaseone don’t even have proof, it is in sweet teeth’s best interest to keep her hidden and be professional. Variety show, idol work, mv filming, dance practice, recording you’re songs and still having time to stroke you’re girl at night. I respect the hustle. He might wanna slow down on the casamigos tho. The combination of alcohol and Botox make his face bloat. Sweet tooth got them chomps so I wonder what that tounge do. Korean oral poverty manifesting sounds depressing, I hope his gf is healthy and ok.</p>
