      <p>okay this random af but all ur anons seem like freaks so im guessing this is a safe place
I used to be big on haobin but as an allindan i cant deal with them no more cus every time theyre next to each other them weibo rosins go crazy like someone posted the paris selca on weibo and it got 160k likes but all the comments were rosins calling hanbin a nasty ugly fat pig (emphasis on fat and pig) like okay damn?
they was also saying shit like "our haohao so kind he even takes pics with staff" which is funny i admit but the rest was just unnecessary üòíüòí
i know everyone gets ghetto on weibo but these hoes are too much thank u for the album sales tho  üôè</p>

      <p>anon trying to find excuses to not ship haobin let‚Äôs not lie to ourselves I know you saw also zerocolas promoting haobin and getting more likes under that post. (Btw the most known haobin acc on weibo has almost 160k followers let‚Äôs not act like hanbin is not liked in there)</p>

      <p>You guys get serious af when it comes to haobin üò≠ but yea that's what I thought cuz c-zerocolas contribute alottt to album sales so it's not like hanbin gets no traction

      <p>and i dont fw zerocolas either tbh cus i dont like how they be acting a lot of the time theyre part of the reason i stopped liking the ship too 
 that one time they were genuinely upset at hanbin cus he was posting too much gyuvin on twt, or when they sent emails to wakeone cus of the lack of content ..

Also hanbin used to be more popular but his cbar fucked up so now hes like public enemy number 1 along w wakeone to rosins (which r the overwhelming majority of the fandom)  ... i wouldnt say he gets much traction cus most what he gets is either negative or from shippers which i cant rly count as popularity since it's inherently tied to another person and revolves around interactions... it's fine to admit hes just not that well liked over there i have come to terms w itü§∑</p>

      <p>okay dont quote me on this cause i kinda forgor but after bp finale his cbar posted smth saying that we dont have to worry about hanbin placing 2nd because the actual center is chinese and wk1 is sinophobic so they'll prob keep pushing hb as the center. i dont remember if it was exactly this but they were def implying smth like that and yeah they got jumped for it (deserved)
I think they also shaded hao like once or twice after that but ig that's normal for cbars since Hao's cbar prepared a whole email template complaining that hes not being treated as center just because Hanbin was center during a dance break at that award showüíÄ 

But the hb cbar thing after the finale was just atrocious idk what went thru their mind posting that</p>
