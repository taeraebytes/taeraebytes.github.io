      <p>Iâ€™m sorry if this is kinda malicious but I always laugh when I see Ricky stand next to TaeraeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Theyre just polar opposites and i hate to use the term but he mugs him so badly,</p>

      <p>the only think ricky got done is chin filler and maybe some nose filler taerae got more work i think. however the chin filler is overdone at sometimes but recently i think heâ€™s been dissolving it so itâ€™s more subtle</p>
