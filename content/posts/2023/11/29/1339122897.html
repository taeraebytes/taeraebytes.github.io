      <p>i wished wakeone would do more documentary style zepisodes instead of bts zepisodes. Like the process of learning the choreo/ practicing their lines, showing their struggles and overcoming it. Imo that's way more interesting and we can connect deeper with the members while bts zepisodes are very surface level iykwim</p>
