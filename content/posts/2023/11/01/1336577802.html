      <p>I don't think they would've spoken up it's their manager yelling at Ricky intervening would make it worse for him and obviously the manager has all the power they don't have any authority to help it wouldn't be any different

      <p>Absent father & no older member to look up to, poor child. He has no proper name figure in his live. His mother seems too occupied with her business to tune in to zb1 but at least she helped him get into yuehua & supports from afar. He better help retire her and continue her work once she gets older.</p>
