      <p>I'm glad they dug it up that shit is weirdddd mia is so disturbing it's written by a convicted pedo it's tagged as children content and ever plot point is just some form of torture porn to the child protags you sent this hrs ago so I'm gonna assume you didn't know the details cuz a lot of ppl haven't heard or this but I've been an avid anime watcher since I was a kid so as soon as I saw he read and talked ab it to his young impressionable fans I was irked
