      <p>my thing is like what even is this "censored" version every arc and plot point is perverted like what is there to watch if every actual disturbing thing was censored the episodes would condense down to 5 or so minutes making no sense you can only censor so much idgaf soobin is weird too taeyong even weirder for owning print of smth in volume 11
