You look at other rookie groups and even though there's definitely more popular members than others, all the members get chances to promote themselves in different ways (ie riize; sungtaro are undoubtedly the most well known and wonbin is the most popular of the new guys debuting but the others still get little gigs and they all post content together). i get the sentiment that one member getting promotion brings exposure to the group, but be fr why do you have 2/3 of your group sitting at home doing nothing besides the occasional tiktok challenge while like 2 members do all the promotions. it doesn't make any sense to me and it feels like a recipe for disaster when you only have one member the gp knows because then the group flops anyways (example sf9)",
