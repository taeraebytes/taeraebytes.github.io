      <p>different anon but i feel like with allindans (as in like the solo stans/akgaes) their "woonghao" is 2binz (though it's a bit different dynamic wise bc 2binz are really close while woonghao aren't that close) like i always notice they go so hard with them and something about it feels like it's bc a lot of them dislike hao/rosins am i crazy for thinking this or nah? like i don't think i have proof yet but there's just a vibe</p>
