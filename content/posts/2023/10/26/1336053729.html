      <p>well I'm not gonna call anyone a hannam cuz I can't clock that stuff I don't speak Korean but definitely the scandals weve had have ruined everyone involved reputation and I have noticed taerae lost a lottt of kfans but idk if it's cuz of gyuvins joke

      <p>Ok let me give you the real tea:
A lot of their individual reputations got fucked up like rlly badly, anytime the members go viral it‚Äôs usually for something bad (but that‚Äôs pretty much how it is for all 4th Gen bg so their no different) but like it‚Äôs effected them to the point where gyuvin‚Äôs PC pricing has gone down by a lot for kfans, ppl leaving the fandom, becoming solos, ppl who don‚Äôt care for them as a group only know of them for controversy like gyuvin bbl messages, etc. For Taerae  I always see ppl refer to them as a gagdol and they clown him  a lot for having an ajuuma personality. Gyuvin is always catching heat but ppl have also started hyper analyzing his interactions with ricky and calling him out for using him to make a fool of himself, the whole ‚Äúmoyaho‚Äù joke pissed alot of ppl off. For gunwook he‚Äôs just always been catching it since BP and it went down for a bit but after he said the stuff abt the japan match ppl attack him again.</p>
