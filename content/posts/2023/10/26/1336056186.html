      <p>mattwook is literally best jebi duo at the moment because it's so clearly not for clout they just genuinely enjoy each other's company.  even with the ridiculous physical size difference gunwook is really matthew's baby and you can tell by how he treats him, and you can tell how much gunwook loves being doted on because he really gravitates to matthew a lot and matthew does it the most (hanbin/hao are probably the next closest to him but less physically affectionate)</p>
