      <p>well I'm not gonna call anyone a hannam cuz I can't clock that stuff I don't speak Korean but definitely the scandals weve had have ruined everyone involved reputation and I have noticed taerae lost a lottt of kfans but idk if it's cuz of gyuvins joke

      <p>correct me if i'm wrong any  kfans lurking here i guess but from what i saw taerae fell off HARD in terms of kfans between bp and debut.  i thought it might've been bc his personality was pretty different from how it was portrayed as on bp (ie he's more. feminine? than the whole church oppa thing he had going) but i realized that the same kind of went for hao and he only grew in popularity. so idk why he fell off during that period but the gyuvin incident definitely didn't help him</p>
