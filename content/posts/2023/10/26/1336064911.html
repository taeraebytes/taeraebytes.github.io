      <p>well I'm not gonna call anyone a hannam cuz I can't clock that stuff I don't speak Korean but definitely the scandals weve had have ruined everyone involved reputation and I have noticed taerae lost a lottt of kfans but idk if it's cuz of gyuvins joke

      <p>correct me if i'm wrong any  kfans lurking here i guess but from what i saw taerae fell off HARD in terms of kfans between bp and debut.  i thought it might've been bc his personality was pretty different from how it was portrayed as on bp (ie he's more. feminine? than the whole church oppa thing he had going) but i realized that the same kind of went for hao and he only grew in popularity. so idk why he fell off during that period but the gyuvin incident definitely didn't help him</p>

      <p>as someone who lurks on k-side, tr didnt fall off majorly but he just hasnt had much growth in fans since bp.  a lot of his fans cross over with evnne members or junhyeon, so from the get go loads of his kfans (who yes voted him into zb1) became inactive as they werent really interested in zb1 much. but for the kfans who sticked with him i noticed they had complaints about him not being very idol-like that they thought he would be. like a lot of them liked him for being quiet flower boy but suddenly his personality changed to ''babygirlz'' style, but tbh i think tr lowkey just goes along with anything and that doest define him to the level it defines maybe hao.</p>
