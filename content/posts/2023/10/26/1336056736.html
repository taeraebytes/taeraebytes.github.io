      <p>3/4 of the fandom hates him or thinks he is undeserving & should get scraps instead. but it’s fine allins love him and they will be the only ones to support him after disbandment anyway. we know haobinners are gonna be bye bye once the ship is separated. but enough serious talk… let’s talk about his gay ass reaction to taemin lmao</p>
