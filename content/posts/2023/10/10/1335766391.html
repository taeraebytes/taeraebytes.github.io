      <p>Unpopular opinion but as much as I love gw I cringe so hard whenever he tries to flirt like esp that it's visibly only when he's getting paid , like he's playing the pedo trap and attracting more wird people and then when he gets wird comment he'll only have himself to blame , and honestly I wouldn't feel bad cuz it's his fault</p>
