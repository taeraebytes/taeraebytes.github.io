      <p>Idk to what extent I'd say he's a asshole but tbh I don't see sincerity in him , yes I know his past and everything but there's something in his eyes that irks me  like he's the most aware of them being temporary in a way?</p>

      <p>there's a headshot of him from when he was like 13 (can't find the pic now but it's definitely out there) and i've seen ppl say he was accepted into sm or was an sm trainee around that time (it might've said sm on the photo but i genuinely can't remember) but idk if there's truth to it or where the info came from</p>
