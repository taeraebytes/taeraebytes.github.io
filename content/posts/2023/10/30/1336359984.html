      <p>Wanna one was pretty much the same I feel like tbh? But we got to see more of their dynamic because ymc pushed a ton of variety & reality content for them. Iâ€™d say zb1 is a little more cliquey tho</p>

      <p>zb1 is realll cliquey for ppl that aren't close like that but that's interesting I guess that's just what happens when you're formed from a 4 month long survival show
