      <p>I wasn't a wannable so idk but I think they had better friendships? honestly zb1 is one of the weirder groups when it comes to dynamics

      <p>Wanna one was pretty much the same I feel like tbh? But we got to see more of their dynamic because ymc pushed a ton of variety & reality content for them. I’d say zb1 is a little more cliquey tho</p>

      <p>zb1 is realll cliquey for ppl that aren't close like that but that's interesting I guess that's just what happens when you're formed from a 4 month long survival show

      <p>gyuriwook yes in a way they kinda made taerae 4th wheel but it also feels like gyuwook and then making Ricky tag along probably because those two clicked instantly and Ricky and gunwook are getting closer w time 
Jiwoong + Hanbin not a clique I don't pay attention to them also
F4 a clique but not really friends it was a popularity thing
Matthew + Gunwook two close people is not a clique
Gyuvin + Taerae again two people not a clique but they're not.... how do I say this it's one sided 
Hanbin + Hao + Jiwoong not a clique if they're not friends like that at least doesn't look that way to me
