      <p>Well he has nothing to say ever if its not bickering with Gyuvin in front of the camera 24/7, thats all he does.. the only time he does something remotely interesting is when the members push him to i'm sorry but he has the personality of a tiktok influencer and not for variety shows</p>

      <p>I get he doesn't have a lot to say he's a quiet dude but he's interesting enough when he's rolling I'm not saying send him alone just with a trio he gets along with like gyuriwook or smth the bday live didnt bore me

      <p>does that mean he’s undeserving on being on any variety show tho u dumb bitch? i’d rather see ricky sit at swf and be pretty than fuckass taerae who we know is the weakest dancer of them all. although we don’t know what they’re gonna be doing, at swf, i highly doubt we’ll have more than 2 mins of the members speaking so it actually doesn’t matter whether u think he has variety skills or not</p>
