      <p>Well he has nothing to say ever if its not bickering with Gyuvin in front of the camera 24/7, thats all he does.. the only time he does something remotely interesting is when the members push him to i'm sorry but he has the personality of a tiktok influencer and not for variety shows</p>

      <p>I get he doesn't have a lot to say he's a quiet dude but he's interesting enough when he's rolling I'm not saying send him alone just with a trio he gets along with like gyuriwook or smth the bday live didnt bore me

      <p>does that mean heâ€™s undeserving on being on any variety show tho u dumb bitch? iâ€™d rather see ricky sit at swf and be pretty than fuckass taerae who we know is the weakest dancer of them all. although we donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re gonna be doing, at swf, i highly doubt weâ€™ll have more than 2 mins of the members speaking so it actually doesnâ€™t matter whether u think he has variety skills or not</p>
