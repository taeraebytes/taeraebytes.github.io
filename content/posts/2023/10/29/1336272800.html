      <p>okay this random af but all ur anons seem like freaks so im guessing this is a safe place
I used to be big on haobin but as an allindan i cant deal with them no more cus every time theyre next to each other them weibo rosins go crazy like someone posted the paris selca on weibo and it got 160k likes but all the comments were rosins calling hanbin a nasty ugly fat pig (emphasis on fat and pig) like okay damn?
they was also saying shit like "our haohao so kind he even takes pics with staff" which is funny i admit but the rest was just unnecessary 😒😒
i know everyone gets ghetto on weibo but these hoes are too much thank u for the album sales tho  🙏</p>

      <p>anon trying to find excuses to not ship haobin let’s not lie to ourselves I know you saw also zerocolas promoting haobin and getting more likes under that post. (Btw the most known haobin acc on weibo has almost 160k followers let’s not act like hanbin is not liked in there)</p>

      <p>You guys get serious af when it comes to haobin 😭 but yea that's what I thought cuz c-zerocolas contribute alottt to album sales so it's not like hanbin gets no traction
